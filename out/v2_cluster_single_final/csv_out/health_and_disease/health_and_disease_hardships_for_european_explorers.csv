166,"The deployment of inadequately equipped ships to the West African coast during the 19th century led to high mortality rates among British naval personnel due to diseases like yellow fever and cholera, highlighting the health challenges of colonial military presence in tropical climates.","The observations from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim regarding high mortality rates among British naval personnel due to diseases like yellow fever and cholera on the West African coast during the 19th century. The textbook highlights the significant susceptibility of Europeans, including British forces, to indigenous diseases in Africa, with death rates among European soldiers being nine times higher than those of African soldiers. This underscores the health challenges faced by colonial military personnel in tropical climates, with diseases such as yellow fever, smallpox, and cholera posing substantial risks. However, the textbook does not specifically mention inadequately equipped ships as a contributing factor to these high mortality rates. In contrast, The African Times articles provide detailed accounts of the deployment of unsuitable vessels, such as the Bristol and the Rattlesnake, to tropical climates, criticizing the Admiralty for inadequate preparation. The articles highlight issues like poor ventilation, inadequate accommodation, and lack of sanitary measures on board, which exacerbated the spread of diseases and led to significant sickness and death. They also suggest that some mortality could be attributed to personal errors and intemperance, indicating that not all deaths were solely due to the inadequacy of the ships. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of the health challenges faced by British naval personnel, emphasizing both the broader context of disease-related mortality and the specific impact of inadequate naval deployments.","The paragraphs from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook provide relevant details that support the claim regarding high mortality rates among British naval personnel due to diseases in West Africa during the 19th century.

To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease. Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively. Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s. Nevertheless, tropical medical schools were established in Europe as early as 1897 in Liverpool and London, 1900 in Hamburg, 1901 in Brussels, followed later by Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles, and in Africa by 1912 in Cape Town and 1918 in Dakar."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.804, 'probability_score': 0.056, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""In tropical Africa governmental medicine was long a military concern although small civilian hospitals began to appear in the 1890s. From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered.

By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""However, the development which probably had the earliest impact on the mortality level was the penetration of the roads and railways. By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths. From 50 to 80 per cent have or have had syphilis or yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm,"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The years from the early 1880s to the mid-iojos mark the demographic divide in Africa. At the beginning of the period the continent's population was still sparse, at least by the standards of the Old World. More signifi› cantly it probably was not growing rapidly and evidenced a vulnerability to the kind of pressures, both internal and external, which were being increasingly applied. By about 1935, the population was undoubtedly grow› ing because of increasing control over mortality, and the basis was laid for a doubling over the next third of a century which almost certainly hastened and consolidated independence.\nMany indices can be used to illustrate the changes between the two dates, and some help to explain the demographic transition. In 1880 a European presence inland from the coast was largely restricted to Algeria, where a third of a million migrants, mainly from France, Spain, Italy and Malta, had consolidated the victory of the French army, and South Africa, where a similar number of Europeans, predominantly of Dutch and English extraction, now had a vanguard as far north as the Limpopo river. (See Fig. i.i.) Elsewhere Europeans were beginning to exert control over Egypt and Tunisia, ruled some coastal populations in Senegal and the Gold Coast (now Ghana) and held such enclaves as The Gambia, Sierra Leone, Lagos, Libreville and parts of Angola and Mozambique. By 1935 European administations controlled almost the entire continent (see Fig. 12.2). The half century saw European medical science progressing from an ignorance of the cause of most of Africa's major diseases to an ability to contain or cure most of them; indeed the period ends just as the sulpha drugs were ushering in an era of chemotherapy of great significance for the continent.

Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent. There were two reasons for the trade: firstly that alcohol could be produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits; secondly, in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, there were real problems about what goods would be accepted in return for the produce of Africa.$^{43}$ Mary Kingsley found the trade spirit pure and likely to do less harm than cannabis,$^{44}$ a view shared by a committee that investigated the liquor trade in içoç.$^{45}$ Spirits were distributed on a huge scale, frequently as wages.

It may have remained constant, as the evidence of the age structure recorded over fifty years by the censuses of the Gold Coast and Ghana suggest.

The other is the possibility that the population has not been stationary, but has been averaging a rate of growth of up to 0.5 per cent per annum for several centuries (for reasons which will be discussed below). The full range of possibilities allows us to describe a society where women averaged 5.5-7 live births yielding a birth rate of 42-50 per thousand, and where the expectation of life at birth was 20-30 years yielding a death rate of 38-50 per thousand and an infant mortality rate of 250-375 deaths per thousand live births. A medium assumption might be a situation where women averaged little more than six live births, where population growth averaged 0.33 per cent, where the expectation of life at birth was about 22.5 years (about the level of Rome at the end of the Republic)$^{20}$ and where the crude birth rate was about 48 per thousand, the crude death rate 45 per thousand and the infant mortality rate 300-350 per thousand.

Whether this could be achieved or not depended entirely on African labour. Profits depended on moving goods and this meant human porterage in most of tropical Africa, for the tsetse fly often prevented the use of draught animals and the lack of roads or railways prevented powered and wheeled vehicles being used. In Middle Africa the most profitable produce was at first ivory which entailed huge quantities of labour for carrying tusks. With the development of the pneumatic bicycle tyre in the late 1880s and the pneumatic car tyre in the 1890s a huge demand for rubber was created, which could not be met for a generation by plantation rubber (the first Malayan plantation came into production in 1910). In the meantime tropical Africa and South America met the demand from wild rubber, found in Africa mostly in vines and also needing great quantities of labour for its collection and initial processing.."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Furthermore, though colonialism did introduce some social services as has been pointed out already, it must be emphasized that not only were these services grossly inadequate and unevenly distributed in each colony, but they were all by and large meant primarily for the benefit of the few white settlers and administrators, hence their concentration in the towns.

Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university.

The most harmful step was the requisitioning of foodstuffs for the home country just when the troops (only 10 000 men in AEF, but a little over 160000 in AOF) were draining the countryside.\nIn Gabon, only a quarter of the compulsorily produced crops were left for local consumption. Even manioc (cassava) was exported from the Middle Congo and Oubangui-Chari: 210 tonnes in 1915 and 157 tonnes in 1917.$^{41}$ In AOF as a consequence of the decision to export local staple crops, the authorities emptied the reserve granaries which were already suffering from the succession of two years of semi-drought (1911-12) and one year of total aridity (1913). This drought had spread over the entire Sudan area, from Senegal to Wadai and Chad. From periodic shortages, the situation worsened to a devastating famine which claimed probably 250000 to 300000 victims,$^{42}$ alleviated only by the 4000 tonnes of cereals that the French Soudan (now Mali) had had neither the means nor the time to ship to France. 43 In AEF where forced sales continued into the following decade in order to provision the Congo-OcØan railway projects, famine, which had begun in 1918, spread to the northern half of the country (Woleu-Ntem) between 1922 and 1925; it probably reduced the Fang population by half, from 140000 to 65000 in 1933. 44 The weakened populations then fell a prey to epidemics: renewed out› breaks of smallpox and especially the spread of Spanish influenza imported from Europe, from which perhaps one-tenth of the population of AEF perished. 45 Though not always accompanied by such disastrous results, the famine problem resulting from food shortages caused by the colonial system was a recurrent feature of the period. It recurred, for example, in 1928-9 in Ruanda, the 'granary' of the Belgian Congo, following another drought, 46 and was indeed the sign of the fragility of countries exhausted by the Øconomie de traite despite the rise in export figures."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""vanished populations along the tracks and river banks from which the people had fled.

Exorbi› tant taxes (increasing in ten years from B.frs 1.25 to B.frs 7) encouraged the population to flee to the Gold Coast instead of raising crops. Forced labour was increased after 1927 by the installation of the administrative services at Niamey and by the extension of the railway. This completely disrupted the farm calendar though the precariousness of the rains made farming times particularly important. The supplies of millet, noncompulsory, depended entirely on the local chiefs. In 1931, the refusal of the administration to lower the head tax, and its insistence on collective payment, which forced the peasants to pay also for deserters and for deceased people, led to a situation in which, as one report put it, 'entire villages vanished ... and an age group was completely decimated'$^{47}$ with, in some areas, a mortality rate of over 50%."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': ""During this period of just over a century those successfully transported across the Atlantic plus those who had died during capture or subsequent transportation probably numbered about 6 million, of whom about 4.5 mil› lion may have been males and 1.5 million females.$^{33}$ The fraction of these persons who would otherwise have probably lived until 1880 is small: a quarter of a million at the most in view of the decline in numbers transported after 1840.

There are very few occasions on which the actual presence of a particular ship of war, whether flag or other, on a station, is so absolutely necessary that she cannot for a short time remove from it, without any injury to the public service that could or ought to be put in competition with the lives of officers and men. We do say, then, that there ought to be a general order in the Navy, that whenever yellow fever, or any other very fatal disease incidental to a particular climate, breaks out on board a ship, the captain should not only be deemed justified in proceeding immediately to other latitudes, but should be bound to do so. The Bristol was sent out to relieve the Rattlesnake, a flag-ship on the African station. The yellow fever appeared on board the Rattlesnake before the Bristol arrived out to relieve her; and Commodore Wilmot, to his great praise and honour, determined therefore at once, in the interests of his officers and crew, and of the public service, not to wait for his relief, but to steam off for England. He did so, and the fatal disease disappeared. But the red-tape system has been adhered to in the case of the Bristol. Disease having, as we have been informed, been generated by imprudent and improper treatment and exposure of the men, the Bristol could not be moved farther north than Ascension! The Bristol must be kept at Ascension, and the officers and crew be killed under routine! We may well say, God help the crew of a ship of war when her commander has not enough courage and decision to do what is necessary for saving the human lives for which he is morally responsible, by acting without orders, or even in disobedience to the stereotyped orders of the service! There may be exceptional circumstances in which it might be incumbent on a commander to keep his vessel at a certain point, however deplorable the mortality, and in such cases we know that British officers would do their duty; but under any other than such exceptional circumstances we feel that they ought not to keep their vessel in a position where climate does not assist the medical officers in battling with the disease on board.'}, {'id': 1078, 'article_title': 'H.M.S.

What can we say, then, to her being dispatched again on the same service? Unfortunately, there is nobody responsible at the Admiralty, or we should say that we hold them responsible for the lives of the officers and men which may be sacrificed in that ill-selected ship.\n\nIn addition to her dangerous unfitness, we have another and a serious objection to urge to her employment in the West African squadron. She is unnecessarily large for the service, and entails a great and unjustifiable expense. The Rattlesnake, which carried the flag of Commodore Wilmot, and in which he did such good service on that Coast, is all that ought to be demanded for a flagship on the West Coast; and the saving that might be effected by the employment of the Rattlesnake, or some equally good ship of her class, would be very considerable. We must earnestly call the attention of our Parliamentary friends to this important subject. The expenses of the West Coast squadron ought to be kept down to the lowest figure compatible with its efficiency, and no ship ought to be sent out to a fever climate that is not so constructed as to give the strongest possible guarantees for the preservation of the valuable health and lives of Her Majesty's sailors. We believe that the naval returns for 1866 will show a most unusual amount of death and sickness in the West Coast squadron, and feel convinced that the greater portion of those lamentable deaths and invalidings were owing to the employment of the Bristol.

There can be no doubt of the great mortality and sickness being the result of an improper selection of ships, as we showed a few years ago, when the yellow fever committed heavy ravages on board one or two of them at Sierra Leone. What can be expected in a tropical climate on board such ships as below described by one of the daily press correspondents on the Gold Coast: ""If one has only a certain distance to go, and one wishes to be as long a time as possible over it, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to select a vessel better fitted for the purpose than Her Majesty\'s ship Bittern. The slowest auxiliary screw collier that drops down the Tyne could walk round Her Majesty\'s ship Bittern, and she sails as badly as she steams. With their rolling propensities, the Bittern class are not comfortable ships to be in. The accommodation for the crew is scanty and ill-ventilated. The officers\' cabins are little better than dog-kennels; the captain\'s state-room is a black-hole. Such is the Bittern."" Is it not time that there should be some new reform in the administration of the Navy, by which a real and effective, and no longer a mock responsibility should attach to the authorities, whoever they may be, who order the dispatch of unsuitable vessels to tropical and other trying climates, to the shameful risk of the lives and health of officers and men.

But no; the health of the forces was good from August, 1863, until some three weeks after they had marched in several directions into the bush of the interior. The mortality and sickness has occurred only since the end of February, with few exceptions. The local error committed we deem to have been this: The rains commenced two months before their time. We think that on the very first day of rain, all idea of further duty in the field should have been abandoned, and nearly all the troops have been ordered back to Cape Coast Castle without delay. When once the rains began, no troops could go into Ashantee, and no Ashantees would come into the Territories. Again, the campaign being over, we think the Tamar's men, who would otherwise have been marched up to camp immediately, where there were rations, &c., for fifty or sixty days, ought not to have been landed, there being no adequate accommodation for them. But the great sickness and death was not among these men, but among those who had been at Prahsoo and other up-country stations.\n\nWe hope that now the party battle has been fought, men will reason calmly about events which, though deplorable, have not the gravity that has been attributed to them.

This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.787, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'West Coast Climate—Yellow Fever—Army and Navy Mismanagement', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Why, this is worse than the ill-fated encampment in the bush at Prahsu, during the so-called Ashantee campaign—a mortality there which led to the assembly of a Parliamentary committee, and the all but abandonment by us of the Protected Territories on the Gold Coast, and other West African colonies and settlements.

This last gave as his opinion, ""that a few thousands spent at Cameroons or Fernando Po would, calculating only the market value of seamen\'s lives, repay themselves in as many years."" But the pros and cons of that lofty range as a sanitarium must be considered, and officers on the Coast should be consulted before the Home Government attempt to spend a large amount on it. There are many advantages in its favour, as may be seen described in the work of Captain Burton, on ""Abeokuta and the Cameroons,"" but there are also some great disadvantages attaching to it as a military sanitarium.\n\nIts distance from the different military stations on the Coast is one great objection, as it is situated about 400 miles below the last—viz., Lagos. It will be no great consolation for a sick officer—laid up, perhaps, with intractable fever, debility, diarrhœa, or dysentery, to be ordered, say, from the Gambia or Sierra Leone, to the Cameroons Mountains, a distance of about 2,000 miles, in a steam-packet, which is most uncomfortable, and unadapted for the conveyance of the sick during a voyage of eighteen days, in a direction quite opposite to the accustomed route—viz., to Teneriffe, Madeira, or England. The result would be found invariably to be that most of the cases, and certainly all the serious dysenteric cases, would succumb before the patient could reach the mountain of good hope. As a naval sanitarium it would be excellent, as it is in the neighbourhood of the rendezvous of the West African squadron, extending from the Volta to the Island of Ascension; and of the great oil rivers, to which so many English merchant vessels resort.

A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2.

Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa.

These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either.

The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.728, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""Certainly in some areas stable administrations apparently resulted in increasing populations in the nineteenth century, such as apparently occurred in Egypt from early in the century as Muhammad$^{ c}$Alî extended irrigation and sanitation$^{53}$ and in Algeria after the French subjugated all opposition in 1879.$^{54}$ The necessity for such stability, especially as civilian instead of military administration became the rule around the turn of the century, arose out of the metropolitan powers' demand that their colonial administrations in Africa should be financially self-supporting.$^{55}$ Hence the increasing concentration on communications and export production.\nPerhaps the major demographic problem in the years up to the First World War centres on the so-called 'labour question' and on the conces› sionaire schemes of Middle Africa.\nIn the late nineteenth century it was the central belief of colonizers that colonies should be profitable.

As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers.

Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all. A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya. This was especially the case against the Nandi.$^{9}$ The Maasai example serves to illustrate the kind of dislocation that had taken place among the economies of various societies in this general area. Thus, colonialism came to an area already suffering from an economic crisis with all its attendant effects.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 118, 'article_title': 'Address to the Colonial Secretary of the Gold Coast, the Hon.

Churchill said the right hon. gentleman had amply shown the necessity for inquiry into the state of affairs on the West Coast of Africa, and he felt, as he was sure the House must feel, great satisfaction that the right hon. gentleman had redeemed so early in the session the pledge he gave last year. (Hear, hear.) The unfortunate Ashantee war, which last year was the cause of so much pain in the House, was of itself sufficient ground for a committee, but there were other reasons why an inquiry should be now undertaken. The state of affairs on the West Coast of Africa was now, and had been for a considerable period, most unsatisfactory. Without any intention to prejudice the present occupiers of the Colonial-office, he must say that Africa had been the bête noir of the department. The unhealthiness of the climate and various other causes of that nature had militated in a great measure against the full development of the resources of the country immediately bordering upon the British settlements. Cape Coast Castle was one of the oldest, if not the oldest British settlement. It was instituted about 150 years ago, when England was a slaveholding power, for the purpose of enabling us to procure slaves to send to our settlements in America. It had been computed that before the slave-trade was done away with, we exported 590,000 slaves from the African coast to America, and we had thus incurred an enormous responsibility, which, as a Christian country, we were bound to make good in some way to that unfortunate people. Therefore the idea of giving up any of the settlements on the Coast would not, he thought, find favour in England, and he did not understand the mover of the committee to make any such suggestion. All he understood the right hon. gentleman to say was, that the present method of Government required inquiry, and that we must either increase our responsibilities by occupying and forming a colony of the protected territory, or we must reduce our responsibilities by limiting the area over which we now professed to exercise protection. The climate, the right hon. gentleman had stated, was notoriously unfit for the Anglo-Saxon race, and that was the reason why more had not been done there. It had been difficult to get men of a superior class to undertake the charge of government on that Coast, but he believed it would be quite possible to locate the Government officers on higher grounds. The same objection was made to Jamaica and our West Indian colonies till it was found out by going to the top of the hills the amount of sickness was very much reduced, and on the West Coast of Africa there were very high hills indeed, where a climate might be found in which the health of Englishmen would not suffer at all. We had been at a charge of 1,000,000l. to support the slave squadron; but he concurred with the right hon. gentleman that where there was a demand there would always eventually be found a supply. He thought it quite possible that England might be induced to make the protected territory into a colony which would be self-supporting, whereas at present we exercised little or no control over the native chiefs, and had done nothing by education beyond the voluntary efforts of missionaries, or by making roads for their cultivation. He did not mean to say that he was prepared to adopt that view at once, but inquiry might be made in that direction. There were others who thought it much better that we should give up the whole of the protected territories, and simply retain the forts as places where there might be stationed small executive governments and a few soldiers; but he did not think if we simply did that we should be exercising the same control over the slave-trade that we did now; whereas, if we made a colony of the protected territory, he believed the development of cotton, the growth of coffee and other things, would be brought into competition with the slave-grown produce of other countries, and would tend to reduce the value of slave labour. (Hear, hear.) So fully alive were the natives of Cape Coast Castle to the inquiry about to be instituted, that they had subscribed large sums for the purpose of sending over here witnesses of their own to place their case clearly before the committee. They would also have evidence from the Basle Missionary Society, whose exertions in behalf of the Africans he was glad to bear testimony to, especially in instruction in useful occupations, by means of which they were leading the natives much more willingly than societies which confined their operations to religious instruction would be able to do. It was unfortunate that in Gambia trade had been falling off. While the number of English vessels had considerably diminished, there had been a corresponding increase among the French. He thought it was a fit subject of inquiry as to whether our system of government had or had not in any way suppressed the energy of our merchants in trading to that country. There was no doubt we had on the Coast of Africa enormous resources, capable of supplying this country with raw material for our manufactures. He believed that last year we imported to England from Cape Coast Castle fifty tons of cotton of a superior kind. Therefore, by giving fair and proper encouragement to the trade, we should no doubt enable them to produce this superior article to enter into competition with slave-grown cotton. He could only further express a hope that the inquiry would lead to great results for the moral improvement of that part of Africa.

This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.'}, {'id': 1088, 'article_title': 'CLIMATE OF WESTERN AFRICA.', 'full_section_title': 'CLIMATE OF WESTERN AFRICA.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1867#article-25', 'issue_date': '23_04_1867', 'content': 'In reference to your remarks upon the African climate, and also in reply to the letter signed ""One who has Escaped from the Jaws of Death,"" I may, as a resident of very many years on the West Coast, give it as my humble opinion that the climate is by no means so bad as many would wish to make it appear; New Orleans, some parts of China, and other places are more unhealthy. I could give you a list of a dozen or more personal friends, mostly traders, who have been on this Coast from ten to twenty years each, and are still strong, healthy men: it is true they have occasionally visited Europe during that time. Many young men shorten their lives by excess, carelessness, and exposure; *but I doubt if they would live long anywhere if they led such dissipated lives as they do here.* ""Climate"" is a common slang term for ""brandy,"" and is frequently employed ironically in that sense, because it is so much the fashion to attribute every death to ""that horrid climate,"" when those better informed know that a large proportion of Europeans hasten their own end by drink. One officer included among the victims of the Ashantee war was found dead in his bed, with a brandy bottle, nearly empty, under his pillow—at least, so ill-natured people said. Another victim of the said war died of epilepsy at Lagos, poor fellow! in fact, the ""war"" had to bear the blame of every death occurring among the troops at the time.\n\nThe much-abused traders, or ""palm-oil ruffians,"" as naval and military *gentlemen* politely term them after eating their dinners, drinking their wine, and perhaps winning their money, certainly undergo as many hardships and privations on many parts of the Coast as do their countrymen of the red coat and blue jacket; but by care and avoiding dissipation they manage to weather the ""climate"" for many years. I do not, however, wish to make any invidious comparison between the two classes; there are sober and steady, as there are dissipated and debauched, of each; how, then, is it the trader survives when the officer succumbs? Perhaps he who has escaped from the ""jaws of death"" (as I have done also several times) would say it is the consolatory hope of reaping ""pecuniary benefit."" It is at any rate somewhat strange that the traders who cannot run away from their business every time they are attacked by fever or dysentery should live, when the officer, who generally experiences little difficulty in getting invalided, should die. And I think this fact is a strong argument against those who abuse the traders and say they kill themselves with drink. One of the foremost in the rank of those who revile the traders was a certain ""young man about town,"" who came to ""flame"" in the ""virgin forest,"" ""kiss pretty savages,"" &c., and who experienced nothing but kindness and hospitality at the hands of the traders whom he met.

We are not advocates for any undue interference with the people, but had rather that for the most part they should be led into improved habits and customs, than that these should be forced upon them. When we reflect, however, upon the nature of the climate in the towns on the West African sea-coast, the epidemical and other diseases to which the people are there subject and exposed, the terrible ravages of such diseases, and the deterrent influence exercised thereby on human civilizing agency, we feel the strongest possible conviction that as one of the first duties and obligations of rulers is'}, {'id': 4126, 'article_title': '1880 AND 1881', 'full_section_title': '1880 AND 1881', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1881#article-19', 'issue_date': '01_01_1881', 'content': 'WHEN this number of our Journal issues from the press, the year eighteen hundred and eighty will belong exclusively to history; and it will no longer concern us, except as it bore within its womb the germs of eighteen hundred and eighty-one, on which we shall have then entered. Nothing we can say or do will have power upon the past; the domain of the future is all that belongs to us; and our duty will be to strive that it shall atone for, and avoid the repetition of, past errors, and mark out for it a career of usefulness and good. The wave of civilization that will ere long flow over West Africa has so far only touched some small isolated portions of its shores, beyond which its life-giving influence can scarcely be said to have been at all felt. Human sacrifices continue to deepen the foul blood-stains in Dahomey; preachers of the Gospel have been convicted of slave-holding and slave-dealing practices in Abeokuta; and let our thoughts take what direction they may, they find but very little to cheer, and nothing to satisfy us. Even if we placed our standard so low as the celebrated Monsieur Gambetta placed his in what has been eulogized as a late magnificent display of oratory in Paris, and were looking forward only to the ""development of humanity,"" all seems dark and drear, gloomy and hideous. We know that the time must come when all this will be changed; but we look in vain for anything that resembles daybreak, except in connection with the cravings of commerce, a thirst for the extension of European dominion, and efforts to develop some of the hitherto neglected resources of countries abounding in all the natural elements of material wealth. Here, however, the prospect is rather cheering. We care not what motives influence the French Government in their costly plans for a railway across the Sahara, and for uniting the Upper Niger countries with Senegal by railroads protected by fortified posts. Anything else is preferable to the uninterrupted continuance of barbarian stagnation; and in making those roads, if they do make them, they are opening the way for the passage of light into extensive regions now lying in darkness and in the shadow of hideous death. We have never ceased to recognize the palpable fact that it is only by the agency of material means employed for the realization of material desires, that the educational element gradually, but, alas! how slowly, preparing in the British West African Settlements, can be made a powerful factor in African regeneration. So far from experiencing any jealousy of the projected magnificent strides of the French Government in West Central Africa, we hail them with delight, and would say to the British Government, ""Do thou likewise."" We do not mean that we would urge them to competing schemes, but only within reasonable limits to imitative ones; while at the same time exhorting and entreating them to take under their charge the work of secular education, literary and industrial, in all their settlements. The people are apt to learn; and within the range of British jurisdiction all ought to be taught, while a chosen number should receive that higher training which may fit and inspire them to be pioneers of civilization among the interior peoples. A proof of their eagerness for this educational elevation is furnished by the efforts making in Accra by some of the natives for high-class training in connection with the Missionary Church of England; a native and hitherto unaided effort, save in so far as it has secured the sympathy of the Bishop of Sierra Leone. It is strange—we cannot comprehend it—that men of such high enlightenment as those who constitute the Government of the British nation should fail to perceive the essential and unalterable difference between their West African settlements and the dependencies of the British Crown in all other parts of the world. In all these latter there is a permanently-resident and ever-increasing British element, which takes with it, more or less, its European civilization, and may be safely left to work out its own future, under the mere protection of the mother country. But the climate of West Africa, the injurious effects of which on European constitutions little or nothing has been done to neutralize, operates as a bar to British colonization, and leaves the progress of the countries to depend upon the native element, which cannot do the work unless trained to it by the governing power, and assisted in it by the introduction, under its auspices, of those material means and scientific appliances which European colonists, if there were such, would introduce and employ. But even where European, and especially British, enterprise does embark, in well-designed operations for developing the resources of the country, which is one of the recognized means for extending civilization, it receives the cold shoulder, instead of the encouraging embrace, of the Imperial Government. It is notorious—no one has better reason to know it than we have—that the efforts now making by French and British capitalists to develop and utilize the resources of the wonderfully rich gold mines of Wassaw, have met with anything but sympathy and willing aid among the Colonial authorities in Downing-street, who cannot see what every enlightened mercantile man sees, that this country of Great Britain will suffer more than any other by a dearth of gold, constant annually increasing supplies of which are indispensable to the national health, of, we might almost say, to the national life. Instead of trying to bridge over the chasm of difficulties which, as in all new enterprises, lay between the plans and their rewarding fruits, there has been a covert hostility, originating chiefly in consideration of the trouble these enterprises might give to the Executive—an overburthened Executive, it may be, but not less an Executive that only exists at all for the public good. We do not hesitate to repeat what we have said so often year after year, that if such gold resources as those of Wassaw had been under the control of any other Power than the British, a railway, however simple a one it might be, would have been run into it from the sea-coast as an invitation to enterprise. We can fancy Mons. Ferdinand de Lesseps at Accra, as Governor-General of the Gold Coast. Wassaw would have disturbed his every slumber until he had got a railway into it; and as it would not suit him, as it has suited too many English officials, to live upon a dung-heap and breathe malarious air while a remedy could be found, Eucalyptus trees, Globulosa and Amygdalena, would be rearing their camphorated heads wherever there was a stagnant swamp or a filth-bed that could be cleared away; while one of his earliest despatches to Downing-street after the first sound of blasting had been heard in the Wassaw Gold Mines, would have been to ask leave to exempt the ""powder"" used in those mines from that scandalous tax of sixpence per pound which now presses so heavily on the mining interests engaged in blasting the precious rock, that they may obtain their auriferous deposit. As Lord Byron, when brooding over decayed Venice, exclaimed, ""O for one hour of blind old Dandolo!"" so, regarding the apathy and indifference of the Executive, from top to bottom, as regards West Africa, we would exclaim, ""O for one decade of a Ferdinand de Lesseps!"" O for a little energy in some materially useful direction, instead of in sentencing native kings to eighteen years\' penal servitude! Of the affairs of that great River Gambia we shall treat in another leader; they are too important, even without the yellow fever at Senegal, to be mixed up in a mild general-indictment against Imperial and local Government.

With reference to the memorial from the mercantile community of the Gold Coast, urging the need of keeping open the trade routes to the interior, with particular reference to the action of the people of Sefwhi, Her Majesty's Government have consented that the Sefwhi country should, on certain conditions, be included in the British Protectorate on the Gold Coast. Captain Lonsdale has been sent up to Sefwhi to arrange with the King and people for their being taken under British protection. The condition will, of course, be imposed that they should refrain from interfering with traders, and give free and unrestricted intercourse through their country. With reference to the complaints of delay on the part of the Governor in replying to the despatch from Colonel Stanley as to the condition of Coomassie, Sir H.

There might be a large staff of officials in the Colony, but the Governor might not have at his disposal a suitable man for such a mission. To appoint an officer not possessing the necessary qualifications would be to risk a serious failure, and an aggravation of the evils it was desired to remove. Sir Henry Holland is most anxious that trade in the West African colonies should be fostered and developed, nor can he doubt that the Governors of those colonies share his anxiety to promote that object. He must express his dissent from the opinion of the Chamber that there has been apathy on the part of the Gold Coast Government in dealing with these matters. The task of maintaining peace and order in the interior, and securing freedom of trade, necessitates tedious and troublesome negotiations, which, owing to the jealousies and differences amongst the various tribes, require to be conducted with much tact and delicacy.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.723, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Great Britain: Her Colonies and Settlements', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'introduction into at least the seats of government such as Cape Coast, Accra, and Lagos, of such sanitary measures as would remove from them their tropical and uncivilized unhealthiness.

Sierra Leone has belonged to Great Britain for over eighty years, and is the most considerable of these colonies, and the centre of government of the whole Coast. Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos were in 1866 placed under the Governor of Sierra Leone, much against their wishes and their interests, and it is the government and welfare of these three smaller possessions which have been the most neglected. For nearly 300 years English merchants have been trading in Gambia, which is the nearest colony to the mother country. The annual imports during the last ten years have averaged 127,000l., and the exports 155,000l. The annual revenue is raised by import and export duties, and amounts to 18,000l., out of which sum over 6,000l. is paid in salaries to the Governor and about 25 civil officers appointed by the Colonial-office. The principal grievance of the merchants resident there is that the Imperial Government appoints all the officers, taxes them heavily to pay the official salaries, and affords no protection whatever against the surrounding native tribes. There is a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, but only one merchant is a member, whose presence is tantamount to being useless when opposed to the opinions of the Government officials. The Gambia merchants complain that in 1870, after attempting to dispose of this colony, the Imperial Government withdrew all the troops, and ever since they have been denuded of all means of defending themselves; and although the Home Government has been appealed to for help, not even a gunboat has visited the colony during the last 16 months, and the colony itself has been compelled lately to arrange for the purchase of a small armed steamer to run up and down the river. Serious disturbances have recently broken out among the natives on British territory, and the natives having threatened an attack upon Bathurst—the seat of the Government—this colony has been compelled to obtain aid from the French Government, and to get their town garrisoned by French troops, and the harbour protected by a French war vessel.\n\nThe colonists also complain that they have now no direct mail communication with this country, and that they are compelled to contribute 1,000l. per annum towards the useless maintenance of a small steamer running once a month to Sierra Leone, 500 miles further down the Coast. During the last five years there have been in Gambia five different Governors or acting Governors. The present Governor was appointed in October, 1871, at a salary of 1,300l. per annum; he has held his appointment eighteen months, out of which time only seven months have been spent by him in the colony.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-02-25', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_04_1873#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.717, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '2. The want of proper sanitary measures is another reason why the climate of West Africa proves fatal to many European constitutions. When streets and yards, both back and front of houses, are made the receptacles of filth and excrement, of putrified remains of dead dogs, cats, and other animal and vegetable matter, is it to be wondered at that the miasma rising from these dung-heaps eventually becomes fatal to those constantly inhaling it. This is a cause which it would be well for the colonial authorities here to take into their serious consideration, as it is most certainly a preventible one. It was only in 1871, during the administration of Mr. J. Pope Hennessy, that the sanitary condition of Freetown seriously occupied the attention of the Government; but whether that gentleman’s plans have ever been efficiently carried out, and what effects they have hitherto had there, we have no means here to ascertain.\n\n3. The Europeans on the West Coast of Africa, unlike their countrymen in India, South America, and elsewhere, perhaps for the reasons I have already stated, are so careless of their personal comfort, and so intent upon accumulating as much money as they can, that they deny themselves every convenience necessary in a tropical climate. In Sierra Leone, for instance, they live in the town, which is at the sea-shore, instead of on the mountains, where they would enjoy the sea breezes equally as well, and be in a cooler and healthier atmosphere. In support of this view, I will only quote a passage which occurs in a paper read by Mr. Hennessy before the Society of Arts in April, 1873, in which he says: “The mountain district (of Sierra Leone), according to the Registrar-General’s Returns, appears to be as healthy as any part of England, or indeed as Madeira, the climate of which it closely resembles.”\n\nI hope I have clearly shown that the large mortality on the West Coast of Africa is not entirely due to climatic influences, and that a great deal could be done by the Government and the Europeans to counteract and mitigate those influences. As living proofs of what I have stated, I beg to point out Mr. Magnus Smith, Mr. A. Montagu, Mr. Marston, and half-a-dozen others, who have resided in Sierra Leone for fifteen or twenty years without meeting with the same fate as their countrymen, and simply because they have known how to live.—I am, dear Sir,', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Report of the Commissioner appointed to Inquire into the Condition of the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'All labour is performed by the domestic slaves of the family, who, as a rule, are kindly treated, and are not often parted with, except under circumstances of necessity.\n\nThere is some reason to suppose that coloured traders and trading agents, when following their avocations at a distance from the settlements, occasionally engage in slave-dealing transactions with the natives; but these operations are conducted beyond British jurisdiction, and as yet it has been found impossible to bring any case home to an offender.\n\nIn point of unhealthiness the climate of the Gambia probably varies little from that of the other settlements. There is considerable sickness during and after the rains; but many of the merchants, finding that their business makes but light demands upon them during that season, are in the habit of passing in England the worst months of the year. Military officers who suffer in health to any considerable extent are at once invalided, and civil officers are afforded every facility for obtaining the advantages of a change of climate: thus not only are very few Europeans compelled to remain in the colony for any length of time without a change, but there is also a consequent diminution in the number of deaths from the effects of the climate.\n\nIt has often been urged that the unhealthiness of the Gambia is largely due to the unfavourable situation of Bathurst, the capital and seat of trade, on the low-lying and swampy Island of St. Mary, and it has been suggested that a great improvement would be effected in this respect by the removal of the seat of government to the more airy and elevated situation of Cape St. Mary.\n\nThere can be no question of the superior healthiness of the Cape, and on this account alone the transfer would be very desirable; but\n\nalthough the government offices might be removed there, it is certain that the merchants would not on this account alone consent to incur the heavy expense of moving their store-houses and long-established places of business from the safe anchorage and convenient landing-places of the river to the exposed situation of St. Mary, which is in no respect so well adapted for the purposes of trade. So long, therefore, as Bathurst remains the seat of trade, it is necessary for its convenience that the custom-house and other public offices connected with it should not be removed from its neighbourhood.\n\nOne cause of the unhealthiness of Bathurst is the existence in the immediate neighbourhood of the town of an offensive and pestilent swamp; but from a recent report of Major Clarke, R.E., it appears that, for the sum of about 7,000£, the whole space, covering nearly 1,000 acres, could be closely and efficiently drained. Unfortunately, the circumstances of the colony forbid the hope that it will for a considerable time to come be in a position to afford this outlay, even for a work of such paramount importance to its interests.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-03-09', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_04_1865#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.732, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the present time, from all parts of the West African coast, we have reports of troubles and disturbances, which must hamper trade and retard the commercial and civilising development of that part of the Dark Continent.

It is much to be hoped that this is the case, for at the present time trade needs fostering on the West Coast more than perhaps ever before, and this object can only be attained by the cheerful co-operation of all interested in its maintenance. The British administration in West Africa has been by no means free from faults in the past; and these faults have born their natural fruit. The secret of good Colonial government would seem to consist in interfering as little as possible with Native customs and prejudices, but at the same time making it thoroughly understood that laws and ordinances must be respected. Now that the dispute with the Jebus and Egbas would seem to be in a fair way of settlement, it affords an opportunity to the Governor of Lagos to insure that, though these tribes are to be treated fairly and with patience, they must quite understand that any infraction of the engagements now or subsequently undertaken by them, will be visited most severely upon the offenders.\n\nBut the troubles in this part of the world are by no means confined to the British.

But we have been subject to such misrepresentations when combating stereotyped misstatements as regards West Africa, that we will not allow any one to misunderstand us. The opinions we put forward with regard to the climate of West Africa have not been hastily or crudely formed, nor have they been adopted to serve some temporary or interested purpose. They are the result of evidence that cannot be disproved. They are promulgated by us to remove prejudices which war against our efforts for the advancement of civilization in Africa, and because we feel that they are pregnant with most practical results. We do not, for instance, pretend that the West African climate is not unhealthy. We admit that it is. But we as fearlessly contend that it is not one whit more unhealthy for Europeans than many of the West India Islands, or than Hong Kong, China, or India, &c. These regions are equally liable to visitations of epidemic disease as is West Africa, in the shape of yellow fever, dysentery, &c. We are, moreover, firmly convinced that if ever the day arrives when complete, and not mere partial statistical tables, are compiled, showing the mortality amongst Europeans at the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and even the new settlement at Lagos, the facts fairly and impartially revealed will demonstrate that at least a moiety of the deaths which occur amongst them are not the result of climatic disease, but are chargeable occasionally to accident; more frequently to a lamentable and wanton neglect of ordinary care and precautions; and too often to reckless indulgences, which will in any climate sap the springs of life, and ultimately destroy it. As additional evidences in support of these statements, take, for example, the records with regard to the numerous governors who have served, or are now serving, in West Africa. We find that in most instances they were and are men who had passed middle life before being called upon to administer those Governments, and were consequently far less able to bear up against attacks of fever. Yet, of the thirty-four gentlemen who have governed Sierra Leone from 1792 to 1864, seven only died there in that long period of seventy-two years. Of those seven, one was killed in action, another veteran most unwisely made fruit and vegetables his sole diet; and one of them had previously lived upwards of thirty-five years in the colony, dying at sea, not of disease incident to the climate, but of cancer of the stomach.

It is true that some of the officials that had been sent to the Gambia suffered much on account of the climate, but many of them (without disrespect) took advantage of the unfavourable report of the West Coast. We saw in the African Times of May 23rd, 1873, that Mr. Quin and others had an interview with the Earl of Kimberley about the affairs on the West Coast, but we were surprised to see that the Administrator, O\'Callaghan, ""had been compelled by ill health to resign."" We admit that Colonel Anton\'s health was totally ruined, which was the cause of his death; but if the life he led there had been closely watched, the authorities would not have come to the conclusion that he was affected by the climate. When the Administrator arrived here and saw the defenceless state of the Gambia, he thought of organizing a kind of Volunteer force; but this was without success. In fact, Mrs. O\'Callaghan was so very much dissatisfied and frightened at the place, that she would be extremely alarmed on hearing the report of a gun, and even the rumbling of carriage wheels. We were very much dissatisfied when we heard that his Excellency, who was stouter than when he entered the Gambia, was ordered home because of ill health, not knowing that he was looking out for another post. He even promised that he would report the state of the settlement on his arrival in England, that measures might be taken to rectify every defect in the place. We could show many instances to prove that our climate is not so unhealthy that Europeans could not live twenty-eight, thirty, forty-four, and even fifty-five years in it. Messrs. Goddard, Brown, Robertson, Chown, Quin, and Chief Justice Mantell are living testimonies of this settlement. The first of these gentlemen was a merchant who amassed a fortune; he lived in Bathurst a period of about fifty-five years, returned home, and died at the age of seventy-eight. The second, who is now in Bathurst, carrying on an extensive business, has been here for forty-four years, and his health, we venture to say, is improving every day. The third, who was the Colonial Surgeon and afterwards Secretary, resided in this settlement for thirty years, and has now retired to Scotland. The fourth, who was a merchant, took a residence in this place for twenty-five years, and returned home with a fortune. The fifth was of the same calling, resided here for the space of twenty-two years, made his fortune, and has taken his abode in England. The Chief Justice, also, stationed in this colony for twenty-eight years, is now holding a situation as a magistrate in England. Lawyer Montague, Smith and others are living testimonies of ""unhealthy"" Sierra Leone. There are others who might have been testimonies on behalf of the West Coast, but many of them died accidentally.

There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years.

The fact ought no longer to be concealed, that half at least of the deaths and incapacities which occur amongst Europeans arise from errors of personal economy, and that the mortality lists are unfairly swelled by ascribing to the climate deaths which have been caused by accident or intemperance.\n\nThe following passages may be adduced as proof that the climate is not to blame for everything:—', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.745, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH MISRULE IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Under this heading there has lately appeared in the London Daily Graphic a series of illustrated articles, tending to show how demoralizing to the Native mind is much that arises from the present system of British rule and influence in this part of the world. It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

For not only is the time of service on that coast doubly reckoned, but they enjoy besides the substantial advantage of private practice. This advantage they do not enjoy in the West Indies, private practice being in the hands of the civil medical practitioners. That the emoluments from this source are considerable, may be judged of by the fact that the late colonial surgeon of Sierra Leone is understood to have realised the handsome sum of 20,000l., and the yearly income of the present colonial surgeon of that colony from official and private practice is, as has been stated by himself and friends, 1,200l. or 1,500l. per annum. We are glad, therefore, to know that some of the native gentlemen are educating their sons to the medical profession. A beginning has been made in this direction, Messrs. Smith and Spilsberry being far advanced medical students at King's College, and the appointment to staff-assistant-surgeoncies of Drs. Davis and Horton is a proof that the Government is alive to the advantages of having coloured medical officers attached to the regiments stationed in West Africa. Strangely, however, their appointment is viewed almost as an intrusion by some of their European professional brethren on the coast, and we have heard it rumoured that one of these medical gentlemen had it even in contemplation to resign his commission rather than subject himself to the passive, but not less harassing annoyances to which he had been subjected. Be that as it may, it is of importance that every encouragement should be held out by the Government to native gentlemen who have qualified themselves to hold appointments either in the army or colonial medical service in West Africa. We are aware that against the appointment of native medical gentlemen the argument is constantly advanced, that neither Europeans nor Africans have confidence in them. This assertion we emphatically deny, and beg to record our protest against it.

With regard to animal products, I might mention ivory and monkey skins. Whereas some of the great races of the interior speak languages which connect them with the Hamitic and Semitic families. The native inhabitants of the West Coast are all that there is of most typically Negro in character; yet I do not mean they are races of particularly low development; on the contrary, the typical Negro is a fine specimen of man, and is by no means as low in his mental state as the races of Polynesia and America. I may cite the Kru tribes of that portion of West Africa which is known as Liberia, a country inhabited by an industrious, energetic, hardworking, stalwart population of free men. An element of heterogeneous ex-slave settlers among the tribes of the coast may be found in some parts of the Colonies of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos. These people represent the Nemesis which invariably follows national crimes. We and our American children indulged to a greater extent than any other European nation in the African slave trade, and, as our wrong-doing was violent and exaggerated, so to a certain extent was the abrupt reparation which followed. Although I would not minimise the work done by our blockade on the West Coast, the abolition of the slave trade was more effectually brought about by the abolition of slavery in the United States of America. One result of our suppression of the slave trade in West Africa has not been altogether advantageous. I refer to the Slave Colonies established at Sierra Leone, and at Fernando Po and other points on the coast. It may be taken that the slaves exported from any district are the least worthy people in it, and the result is that a large proportion of this population is descended from the sweepings of West Africa, and has not yet passed through sufficient generations to eliminate the ancestral badness of its progenitors. So, although here and there a negro has shown what the race can attain to under favourable circumstances, still the bulk of the ""S\'a Leone"" people who are scattered up and down the coast are of an undesirable character, and the cause of indiscriminating blame on the part of superficial observers which is most unjustly laid on the shoulders of the entire population of West Africa; whereas many of these races are superior in intelligence, enterprise, and integrity to any of our negro fellow-subjects in South Africa or the West Indies. What admirable recruits to civilised society can be obtained from many of these people may be instanced by such men as Bishop Crowther, Archdeacons Johnson and Crowther, Samuel Lewis, and other divines and lawyers and officials in West Africa, who are on a par with well-educated white men, and in some cases superior in intelligence and acquirements to the whites with whom they come in contact. It is absurd, however, to regard the Negro race, as a whole, on the same average level as the European—they are far below us. Take them in their native wilds, and they are what we were before Julius Caesar landed in this country; indeed, in many cases they are not 2,000 years behind us, but 10,000. They are in the condition of some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and Gaul, and Spain, whose history we can dimly spell out from their implements and scattered remains, who were undoubtedly cannibals and probably naked, and leading a brutish life. Yet we can in a few years drag them from the condition that prevailed 2,000 years before Christ into the year of grace 1889. We can take a cannibal from the Upper Cross River, and transport him to the centres of civilisation in England or America, where everything represents the utmost result of our present development; but what will be usually the result both with the individual and the race? The savage mind will be unable to grasp and assimilate one-third of the wonders presented to his consideration, and will probably even suffer from the shock. We cannot expect the negroes of West Africa to become all at once intelligent, self-governing people. For many years the white races must be their guardians and educators, and we must educate the negro by force if necessary, leaving him to understand us afterwards, when we have raised him to a condition to do so. This, then, is our mission in West Africa: to instruct the natives that idleness is the eighth deadly sin; next, to so instruct the native as to the existence of the resources of this country; and, lastly, to educate him in the principles of civilised society, and so assimilate his views with our own that he and we may be bound together with the ties of commerce and Empire.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.711, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True
474,European naval crews faced significant health challenges on the West Coast of Africa due to inadequate ship conditions and poor adaptation to tropical climates.,"The claim that European naval crews faced significant health challenges on the West Coast of Africa due to inadequate ship conditions and poor adaptation to tropical climates is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the high mortality rates among Europeans in Africa, particularly due to indigenous diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, and sleeping sickness, which were prevalent in the tropical climate. Europeans were more susceptible to these diseases than Africans, as evidenced by the higher death rates among European soldiers compared to African soldiers in British West African forces. The text notes that Europe was not well-equipped medically for its African ventures, with limited knowledge and resources to combat tropical diseases until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and it discusses the late development of tropical medical schools and the limited availability of effective treatments for tropical diseases before the 1920s. While the text does not specifically address ship conditions, the general lack of medical preparedness and high susceptibility to tropical diseases suggest that naval crews likely faced similar health challenges. In contrast, The African Times articles provide explicit details about the inadequate ship conditions, highlighting high mortality and sickness rates among crews on Her Majesty's ships due to improper ship selection and poor living conditions, such as inadequate ventilation and cramped accommodations, as seen in ships like the Bittern and the Express. The articles also discuss the lack of adaptation to the tropical climate, with Europeans often failing to adjust their lifestyle and dietary habits, leading to health problems, and mention the excessive consumption of alcohol and neglect of hygienic practices as contributing factors. Together, these observations emphasize both the inadequate ship conditions and poor adaptation to the tropical environment as significant factors affecting the health of European naval crews on the West Coast of Africa.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that indirectly support the claim that European naval crews faced significant health challenges on the West Coast of Africa due to inadequate ship conditions and poor adaptation to tropical climates.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel.

Cre› ativity became especially necessary where a small number of Europeans lived among a large number of Africans as was the case in many colonies of exploitation such as Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Saint-Domingue. Where the European population failed to comprise a critical mass, the Africans had to build a society from a diverse collectivity of individuals who had little more in common than their skin colour and their servility. The adoption of their customs and behaviour by the non-African sector indicated the measure of their success.\nAfricans did not always conform to the society into which they were thrust. For centuries marronage, or the flight from the slave system, existed as an integral aspect of slavery.$^{53}$ In Brazil, the north-east witnessed the establishment of the quilombo of Palmares which lasted almost a century and which was eliminated only with the largest military force ever mounted in the Americas by the Portuguese and Brazilians. Maroon towns existed for equally long periods in Esmeraldas in Ecuador and in parts of the Blue Mountains and the Cockpit Country of Jamaica.

To be sure, they had a better knowledge of their country, and the severity of the climate, which forced the Europeans to suspend operations during certain periods of the year, occasionally provided them with some respite. But the bulk of the conquering troops were Africans officered by Europeans. Hence these riflemen were not out of their element. Frequently the West Africans, like the Maghribians (see Chapter 5) did not even have the advantage of greater numbers. Often behind the regular troops of the invaders, there marched thousands of African auxiliaries from annexed or protected territories whose chief function was systematically to pillage the country in conflict with their protector so as to disrupt its internal organization. Moreover, the West African states never succeeded in setting up an organic alliance that would compel their enemies to do battle simultaneously on several fronts. Certain states clearly perceived the necessity for this, but their attempts to bring it about came to naught. Most of the resisters resorted to guerrilla warfare too late, when they had learned through defeat that neither conventional warfare nor the defensive systems of the 'tatas' left them any chance of success in the face of enemies possessing weapons capable of greater destruction. To all that must be added the fact, already pointed out above, that in 1890 the imperialists, by the Brussels Convention, reached an agreement that no further arms should be sold to Africans. Thereafter, the Africans encountered severe logistic problems.

As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.\nThis flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours. This route also linked Yorubaland with Borgu, Hausaland, Borno and beyond.

At that time the volume of trade between the two coasts was quite considerable.

African sailors were also common by this time in the merchant service, though more so in Portugal than in France or Britain. Another significant, if smaller, group was made up of students, who began to arrive in Europe in significant numbers by the middle of the eighteenth century and, in increasing numbers, throughout the nineteenth century. In an era in which commercial contact between Europe and Africa was increasing, it was an obvious advantage to African traders to be literate in a Western language and to have some acquaintance with European accounting practices. Many of these students therefore came to Europe through the good offices of European slave-traders operating in Africa and studied under their care in the principal slave-trade ports like Liverpool or Nantes.\nStill another peculiarity of the African communities in Europe was the fact that they were overwhelmingly male. This fact had two important implications. The African community was not self-sustaining. It had to be, and was, constantly replenished from overseas. This is not to say that the Africans had no sexual relations with European women, but the products of these relationships tended to be culturally European rather than African. After a few generations, the African physical appearance tended to disappear into the general European genetic pool.\nSome Africans also found their way into Eastern Europe, in spite of a more attenuated maritime contact with tropical Africa itself. There, the main line of entry was by way of the Ottoman slave trade, which was not mainly a trade in North Africans, but included sub-Saharan Africans drawn across the Sahara to Ottoman-associated ports like Tripoli, or brought north down the Nile from what is now the southern Sudan.$^{32}$ In a few instances, small pockets of African culture persisted in parts of the Ottoman empire into the twentieth century, such as a small Hausa-speaking com› munity in what is now Yugoslavia.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The new changes resulted from a combination of factors, including the nineteenth-century wars which, as in Yorubaland, had the effect of ren› dering the coastal areas relatively safe and attractive to migration from the hinterlands in which most of the fighting took place; the sea-borne trade which was rendered permanent by the transition from slave to 'legitimate' trade, thereby conferring a definite economic advantage on the coastal regions; and the steady growth of European interest, which enlarged the traditional role of selected coastal towns such as Lagos, Porto Novo and eventually Cotonou to take on new and increasing responsibilities not only as ports but also as political capitals of emergent colonial states and their independent African successors.\nIn all these changes, however, the economic factor would appear to have been the most dominant, especially with reference to the European presence. Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

Neither the desert dwellers nor the highlanders could take much time off from their orchard farming and stock-rearing; and this allowed the invader to launch real economic warfare against them. During the Adrar campaign in 1909 the French soldiers occupied the oases at the time of the date harvest and waited for the men to be compelled by hunger to come and surrender (admittedly not for long).

With temperance in diet, stimulants, and, generally, personal cleanliness as well as surrounding cleanliness, a free interchange of air in dormitories, exercise in the open air, and a moderate exposure to the sun, I think Europeans, fully grown and with sound constitutions, could remain many years on the Coast, and return to Europe without much impairment of health. This would be very much more true could merchants choose their trading stations. For obvious reasons at present the mouths of the rivers are chosen, which above all are the most unhealthy places, especially as in many cases pure water cannot be had, and river water, often impure, is used for all purposes. Afloat, with little communication with the shore, no general leave at notoriously unhealthy places, using distilled water, or good spring water when it can be had without exposing the men to too much fatigue or malaria, avoiding river waters, and rarely entering them; a free use of quinine when required; doing away with boat cruising, more berthing accommodation, a liberal supply of fresh beef and vegetables, allowing the men to buy stock at the various places, less drill aloft, great attention to personal cleanliness and the general cleanliness of the ship, I feel sure, putting aside the so-called infectious epidemics, which ought rarely to occur, the health of the cruisers would be as good as on any station, and better than on many.""'}, {'id': 1793, 'article_title': 'A Dreadful Voyage Between Lagos and England', 'full_section_title': 'A Dreadful Voyage Between Lagos and England', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1870#article-13', 'issue_date': '23_04_1870', 'content': 'Captain Hannan, of the Florence Pope, bound from Lagos, on the West Coast of Africa, for Liverpool, and which was abandoned at sea in January, in his report of the loss of the ship, gives the following fearful account of the voyage: ""We left Lagos on the 4th of September, and on the 23rd of October one of the seamen, named Thomas Welsh, died of African fever.

What can be expected in a tropical climate on board such ships as below described by one of the daily press correspondents on the Gold Coast: ""If one has only a certain distance to go, and one wishes to be as long a time as possible over it, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to select a vessel better fitted for the purpose than Her Majesty\'s ship Bittern.

(The Express has had a curious round of service during her commission. She hoisted the pennant on the 14th Feb. 1884, at Devonport, and proceeded to the Mediterranean, then to Egypt, returned to Gibraltar, went across the Atlantic to the West Indies, returned to England, was docked and refitted at Devonport, served with the Evolutionary Squadron in Ireland, thence proceeded to the West Coast of Africa, and now again goes to the West Indies, and soon back to England, for she has nearly completed her three years' commission.) The crew will be delighted to leave this place, for the accommodation on board a vessel of this class is of the most wretched description. It is so hot at night as to be almost unbearable, and when below the men can hardly breathe, for owing to the surf there is an incessant roll which prevents the opening of the scuttles, consequently there is no circulation of air in the lower deck. It is no wonder that many of the crew have been on the sick list. The Express is a gunboat of an obsolete type, and such vessels ought never to be sent on such a station as this. It is to be hoped that for the remainder of her commission she will be employed in the northern part of the American Station.\n\nThe Express is now waiting for the arrival of some machinery to replace those portions which were found to be defective and caused the breakdown on November 25. It was discovered there were serious flaws in her machinery which was repaired by the engine-room staff of the vessel, and she arrived at Akassa on December 2.

A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2. Avoid getting chilled by standing or sitting for any length of time when the body is unduly heated, or by neglecting to change underclothing as soon as possible after profuse sweating.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1887#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sanitariums for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'M\'Carthy\'s Island, River Gambia, Dec. 20, 1864.\n\nMy Lord,—In the editorial article in the Lancet of October 13, page 442, we find the remark that ""it is a singular fact in medical geography that from St. Louis, Senegal, on the north, to Mossamedes, on the south, there is not upon the seaboard a single healthy acre of ground. The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE AFRICAN CLIMATE', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Since that time Fernando Po has changed its deadly nature, as the coming chocolate and coffee planters will find.

Nor do you make any distinction between the colonies, classing Sierra Leone with Lagos, Gambia, and Cape Coast, which I am sure the facts would not warrant.\n\nTo revert, however, to the causes of mortality on the West Coast of Africa, I am of opinion that there are many influential causes conducing to the same which might be prevented, and I take the liberty of intruding on your valuable space to enumerate one or two of them.\n\n1. The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics. In Brazil, no doubt, some Europeans drink themselves to death, but they are few; the majority, being of a better class, prefer to live well and to enjoy themselves rationally, without making beasts of themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.72, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CLIMATE OF WESTERN AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I am not singular in believing that healthy Europeans coming to Africa to reside may do so with comparative safety, if they will only take proper precautions to preserve their health.

Yes, here is new evidence of the fact, that the denunciations hurled by the families of victims, and by journalists ignorant in these matters, upon the climate of certain portions of the globe under British rule or power, in which British soldiers, sailors, and civilians have to serve, ought rather to be heaped on the authorities who so unnecessarily and wantonly sacrifice the lives of their fellow-subjects and fellow-servants.

We make these remarks by way of introducing to more general notice the papers above noted, because they supply much valuable and novel information, not only regarding the diseases to which Europeans and natives are subject in West Africa, but because they furnish an interesting description of the topography of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.\n\nMr. Clarke is of opinion that the climate of West Africa, if fairly tested, can stand comparison in point of healthfulness with most of our colonies in the East or West Indies, where endemic and epidemic fevers, dysentery, with cholera to boot, prevail quite as frequently and fatally. There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years. Comparatively, their number is not small, comprehending persons of all classes—governors, civil and military officers, merchants, and missionaries, with their wives and families. He states ""that formerly many officers in the English, Dutch, and Danish service resided upon the Gold Coast, some fourteen, twenty, and thirty years,* and enjoyed good health, although those in subordinate positions had to remove from one station to another."" The fact ought no longer to be concealed, that half at least of the deaths and incapacities which occur amongst Europeans arise from errors of personal economy, and that the mortality lists are unfairly swelled by ascribing to the climate deaths which have been caused by accident or intemperance.\n\nThe following passages may be adduced as proof that the climate is not to blame for everything:—', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.746, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of West Africa—Gold Mining—The Labour Question', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Now, first, as regards the climate and mode of living. With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.711, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CLIMATE OF WESTERN AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In reference to your remarks upon the African climate, and also in reply to the letter signed ""One who has Escaped from the Jaws of Death,"" I may, as a resident of very many years on the West Coast, give it as my humble opinion that the climate is by no means so bad as many would wish to make it appear; New Orleans, some parts of China, and other places are more unhealthy. I could give you a list of a dozen or more personal friends, mostly traders, who have been on this Coast from ten to twenty years each, and are still strong, healthy men: it is true they have occasionally visited Europe during that time.

One officer included among the victims of the Ashantee war was found dead in his bed, with a brandy bottle, nearly empty, under his pillow—at least, so ill-natured people said. Another victim of the said war died of epilepsy at Lagos, poor fellow! in fact, the ""war"" had to bear the blame of every death occurring among the troops at the time.\n\nThe much-abused traders, or ""palm-oil ruffians,"" as naval and military *gentlemen* politely term them after eating their dinners, drinking their wine, and perhaps winning their money, certainly undergo as many hardships and privations on many parts of the Coast as do their countrymen of the red coat and blue jacket; but by care and avoiding dissipation they manage to weather the ""climate"" for many years. I do not, however, wish to make any invidious comparison between the two classes; there are sober and steady, as there are dissipated and debauched, of each; how, then, is it the trader survives when the officer succumbs? Perhaps he who has escaped from the ""jaws of death"" (as I have done also several times) would say it is the consolatory hope of reaping ""pecuniary benefit."" It is at any rate somewhat strange that the traders who cannot run away from their business every time they are attacked by fever or dysentery should live, when the officer, who generally experiences little difficulty in getting invalided, should die. And I think this fact is a strong argument against those who abuse the traders and say they kill themselves with drink. One of the foremost in the rank of those who revile the traders was a certain ""young man about town,"" who came to ""flame"" in the ""virgin forest,"" ""kiss pretty savages,"" &c., and who experienced nothing but kindness and hospitality at the hands of the traders whom he met.

The Roquelle brought the crew of the German barque Emmi and Otto, which was lost on Akassa Bar. The crew had a very narrow escape with their lives. The Roquelle was at the river when the disaster happened, and put off a boat to the rescue of the men. They could not, however, be seen, and it was feared for a time that they had been all drowned. The Roquelle, however, afterwards found that the men had been washed ashore on one of the vessel's masts. They were taken on board the steamer and well cared for. The surf on the Akassa Bar when the disaster happened was very turbulent, and the vessel was completely demolished a few minutes after striking. The Roquelle also brought information of the wreck of another vessel, namely, the trading brig Astarte, of London. The Astarte was at Grand Bassam, but owing to the heavy surf she was forced from her moorings and wrecked. She had on board at the time about 250 casks palm oil. The casks were smashed to pieces by the waves.\n\nThe bad surf was the cause of another disaster, though in this case attended with loss of life. Whilst the cargo was being landed at Cape Palmas from one of the steamers one of the surf boats was swamped by the waves, all of the occupants being thrown into the water. These were 10 in number, and all succeeded in getting on to the upturned boat. The boat itself was eventually driven on to the beach, but before it reached there two of the men were washed off and drowned. Both were traders belonging to Liberia. A boat which was sent from the steamer to the assistance of the upturned craft had also a narrow escape, the occupants being, after some difficulty, rescued by a second boat from the steamer. The passengers which the ship had, could not be landed, and had to be taken to Cape Palmas, a considerable distance from the coast, and landed there.\n\nGermany seems to have much trouble with her new possessions in the Cameroons.

The articles report high rates of illness and death, with many soldiers being invalided home or dying from diseases such as dysentery and fever, and criticize the lack of proper medical precautions and inadequate supply of fresh provisions. The harsh climate, including the rainy season and unhealthy camp locations, further exacerbated the situation. The use of remedies like Lamplough's Pyretic Saline and Warburg's Tincture is mentioned, indicating some recognition of the need for better medical preparations.

Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively. Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s. Nevertheless, tropical medical schools were established in Europe as early as 1897 in Liverpool and London, 1900 in Hamburg, 1901 in Brussels, followed later by Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles, and in Africa by 1912 in Cape Town and 1918 in Dakar."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.77, 'probability_score': 0.056, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""In tropical Africa governmental medicine was long a military concern although small civilian hospitals began to appear in the 1890s. From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters.

The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A fragile population emerging from near stability', 'content': ""Confining our attention to the area outside the low fertility zone, we can hazard some reasonably good guesses about pre-modern sub-Saharan populations by employing stable population methods of analysis.

The other is the possibility that the population has not been stationary, but has been averaging a rate of growth of up to 0.5 per cent per annum for several centuries (for reasons which will be discussed below). The full range of possibilities allows us to describe a society where women averaged 5.5-7 live births yielding a birth rate of 42-50 per thousand, and where the expectation of life at birth was 20-30 years yielding a death rate of 38-50 per thousand and an infant mortality rate of 250-375 deaths per thousand live births. A medium assumption might be a situation where women averaged little more than six live births, where population growth averaged 0.33 per cent, where the expectation of life at birth was about 22.5 years (about the level of Rome at the end of the Republic)$^{20}$ and where the crude birth rate was about 48 per thousand, the crude death rate 45 per thousand and the infant mortality rate 300-350 per thousand.

It is more difficult, but perhaps not impossible, to imagine that the level of disease (venereal disease and other infections) generated during this period still resulted in a high level of female sterility half a century or more afterwards. It is also difficult to feel that the situation in this region is adequately covered by a recent United Nations' publication writing of'cultural shock' and 'the processes of adjustment'. 71 Eventually the colonial penetration was to lead to a great increase in population.

Some of the more spectacular of them were the develop› ment of palm-oil exports from the Niger delta, the discovery of diamonds and then gold in Southern Africa in the years from 1870 to 1900, the development of an indigenous cocoa-growing industry in the Gold Coast in the 1890s and the discovery of huge deposits of copper between the Congo and Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) in the early years of the century."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A fragile population emerging from near stability', 'content': 'This picture is not in any way surprising.

Given the mortality levels described above (which is a conservative assumption in view of the fact that the health conditions of the forests of the west coast equatorial area have probably long been worse than elsewhere), the conclu› sion could be drawn that in the centuries past those areas averaging 5 births per woman had experienced population declines averaging over 0.5 per cent per annum, and those averaging 3.5 children declines of over 1.5 per cent per annum. This is inconceivable over any protracted period; the latter population would be halving every forty years, and both situations suggest much larger populations during the earlier years of European contact than has ever been suggested.

By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent. There were two reasons for the trade: firstly that alcohol could be produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits; secondly, in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, there were real problems about what goods would be accepted in return for the produce of Africa.$^{43}$ Mary Kingsley found the trade spirit pure and likely to do less harm than cannabis,$^{44}$ a view shared by a committee that investigated the liquor trade in içoç.$^{45}$ Spirits were distributed on a huge scale, frequently as wages.

The troops had disembarked at Majunga and were to use the celebrated 'LefŁbvre carts' in their advance on the capital. They were therefore compelled to build a road. Fever and dysentery broke out while they were laying the earthworks in the swamplands, and the expeditionary corps was turned into an 'endlessly straggling column caught up in its baggage trains and its dead and dying'. 16 The royal army did not mount any guerrilla attacks on the flanks or at the rear of the sorely tried French troops. Ranavalona's forces were dispersed at the various ports. Those who were sent to head off the French erected fortifications which they evacuated as soon as they were bombarded or circumvented. Neither the soldiers nor their officers had received any proper military training and they were bewildered rather than motivated. Rajestera, an officer at the front, recalled the dissension and strife in the army when he wrote: 'There was a feeling of discouragement on all sides, as much among the ranks as among their chiefs, especially when it was learnt that, although the Prime Minister's relatives and friends, and especially his grandson, Ratsimanisa, had discreetly remained behind in Imerina, they were sharing in the honours which ought rightly to have been bestowed on those who had to suffer the fatigue and dangers of the war'. The announcement that Ratsimanisa, of whom the officers dis› paragingly spoke as being 'a mere boy who no sooner wakes up than he falls asleep again and is just about fit to grill sweet potatoes', had been elevated to the rank of the 'Fifteen Honours', one of the highest in the hierarchy, was the last straw that sapped morale and blunted the resistance. 1 7 In view of this situation, General Duchesne, commander-in-chief of the French expeditionary corps, detached a light column from the main body of the army, which was bogged down by its sick and its carts and equipment. This column drove the queen's regular troops before it and put them to flight before taking Antananarivo on 30 September 1895.

As A. G. Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.048, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy of the former French, Belgian and Portuguese zones, 1914-35', 'section_title': ""The workers' burden > The crises and their repercussions > Food shortage, famine and epidemic"", 'content': ""There were situations of severe famine such as that in Niger in 1930, of which Zerma-Sonrai still have memories, followed by an invasion of locusts.

Forced labour was increased after 1927 by the installation of the administrative services at Niamey and by the extension of the railway. This completely disrupted the farm calendar though the precariousness of the rains made farming times particularly important. The supplies of millet, noncompulsory, depended entirely on the local chiefs. In 1931, the refusal of the administration to lower the head tax, and its insistence on collective payment, which forced the peasants to pay also for deserters and for deceased people, led to a situation in which, as one report put it, 'entire villages vanished ... and an age group was completely decimated'$^{47}$ with, in some areas, a mortality rate of over 50%."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy of the former French, Belgian and Portuguese zones, 1914-35', 'section_title': ""The workers' burden > The crises and their repercussions > Food shortage, famine and epidemic"", 'content': ""A feature of the whole of this period was the acuteness of the food supply crises.\nThe war economy of the years 1915-18 had some very serious implica› tions. The most harmful step was the requisitioning of foodstuffs for the home country just when the troops (only 10 000 men in AEF, but a little over 160000 in AOF) were draining the countryside.\nIn Gabon, only a quarter of the compulsorily produced crops were left for local consumption. Even manioc (cassava) was exported from the Middle Congo and Oubangui-Chari: 210 tonnes in 1915 and 157 tonnes in 1917.$^{41}$ In AOF as a consequence of the decision to export local staple crops, the authorities emptied the reserve granaries which were already suffering from the succession of two years of semi-drought (1911-12) and one year of total aridity (1913). This drought had spread over the entire Sudan area, from Senegal to Wadai and Chad.

Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

Neither the desert dwellers nor the highlanders could take much time off from their orchard farming and stock-rearing; and this allowed the invader to launch real economic warfare against them. During the Adrar campaign in 1909 the French soldiers occupied the oases at the time of the date harvest and waited for the men to be compelled by hunger to come and surrender (admittedly not for long). In areas where seasonal migration with stock took place, they closed off the winter pastures and relied on cold and hunger to bring the inhabitants to terms.

It is constructed at the base of a gradual descent; so that when, as of late, it rains very heavily, all around the camp is something like a mud swamp. The bush having been only so lately cleared, the earth which has thus become exposed cannot be expected to exhale anything else but malaria, and therefore it will be contrary to all the rules of hygiene to expect the camp at Prahsoo to be healthy. Its close proximity to the river, although pleasant, tends, of course, to increase the dampness of the encampment. The contrast between the atmosphere during the day and night is too sudden for health, the variation being more than 20 degrees. Whilst the excitement lasted there was very little sickness, but after a residence of sixteen days one, and another, and another, became so dreadfully ill, that the medical officer in charge was obliged to invalid them to the seacoast; so that within eight weeks of their arrival in the bush nearly the whole of the officers left the Prah for Cape Coast in a dreadful state. The troops arrived at the Prah about the 1st February, and on the 8th April, when the Tamar anchored in Cape Coast roadstead, there were fourteen officers of the 4th West at the Castle; and such was their state of health, that at the dinner given to *fête* the arrival of the reinforcement, only one was able to leave his bed and meet them, and even he was in a dreadful state of debility. Out of twenty-six officers who left the Coast for the field, fifteen, or thereabout, have been invalided home, in a very precarious state, three have died, and four are still obliged to keep their bed, though not sufficiently ill to be invalided. Of the soldiers many have died, principally from dysentery. A great many are so weak, that, in all probability, they will not be fit for active service in the field for the next twelve months. Of the twelve medical officers on the Coast, three have been invalided, one has died, and three are still prostrated with fever. Of the soldiers of the detachment of the 1st West India Regiment sent up to Prahsoo on the 24th April, we gather from the report of the medical officer in charge that seventeen were admitted into hospital within three days of their arrival in the camp, and that an average of twenty were daily reported sick. Such, then, is the present position of the troops on the Gold Coast. It is dreadful to both Africans and Europeans; and should the Government intend to have it supplied with troops from the West Indies, it must be prepared to find means of properly rationing them with fresh provisions. It is a great pity to bring a lot of men here to sacrifice their lives; and whenever a lasting peace is proclaimed between our Government and the King of Ashantee, I think it will not be an imprudent act to have the Coast supplied, according to the recommendation of Sir Benjamin Pine, with a strong police constabulary and a small detachment of only about 100 men. The troops on the whole of the West Coast should, I also think, be under the command of a major-general, whose residence should be at Sierra Leone, and the detachment here should be relieved every year. This will be a very great improvement on all sides, both for the officers and men, and the mortality will be by far less than it would be if the men were to be fed continually for three years on salt beef and pork.'}, {'id': 385, 'article_title': 'Sickness and Death among the Gold Coast Troops', 'full_section_title': 'Sickness and Death among the Gold Coast Troops', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1864#article-23', 'issue_date': '23_06_1864', 'content': 'A great political battle has been fought in England over the sick and dead officers and troops of the Gold Coast.

And we therefore most deeply regretted that an unfair colouring was given to events in order to obtain a party victory, if possible, out of what may properly be termed a human defeat. For as our friends on the Coast well know, the deaths were the triumph of malaria and decomposition over vital powers. The real facts of the case prove this. We do not say that there has not been some error and oversight both here and in the colony, but not such as have been charged.

The tolling of the bell from the church spire tells of another added to the almost unparalleled (on this Coast) number of the dead and dying. Amongst our new comers Cape Coast is a huge graveyard. My account by the last mail did not attempt to give you the least adequate idea of the rate of mortality amongst the officers and men of the West India Regiments who have been sent out to find an early grave in this lone and dismal country of the Gold Coast. Of whom, we cannot help asking, will account be demanded of these dead and dying here? The good old chaplain has had enough to do, as for the last four weeks scarcely one day has passed without his being called upon to read the prayers over the cold and lifeless bodies of once active, promising youths. According to his reckoning, from the 1st of January to the 1st of June one man, on an average, has died every day. Yes, one man a-day, British public—one man a-day for five months of a force of 600 men, only lately increased to 1,200; and in this one per diem not reckoning those who have died in the camp or on their way to the Coast!!! It is an most frequent thing to see two coffins carried away to the graveyard in the morning and two in the evening. Out of the small number of the officers on the Coast, from the 1st of January, the death rate has been two per month, and with the European sergeants it has been fearful. This awful mortality, caused by the protection of a lame runaway Ashantee captain, with eighty of his wretched followers, or the refusing to give proper redress to the King of Ashantee after the murder of forty of his subjects by the King Ajiman, has produced a sensation on the West Coast of Africa unparalleled in the history of the affairs on the Gold Coast.

Is this to continue? Are a lot of men to be sent out to their early grave in this way? We call upon the Government to withdraw the troops from the Gold Coast; we call upon the African-Aid Society to represent to them the necessity there is of removing them to a place where they can be properly provisioned, leaving only a small detachment, which could receive a certain but sufficient supply of fresh provision at least three times a-week; at present it is a point of question whether the authorities could afford to supply them even once a-week.'}, {'id': 394, 'article_title': 'ASHANTEE WAR', 'full_section_title': 'ASHANTEE WAR', 'last_edit_date': '06-01-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1864#article-5', 'issue_date': '23_07_1864', 'content': 'You have in your last number indirectly urged the necessity of withdrawing the troops from the interior before the commencement of the rains, as it will produce a most fatal result amongst them.

I have been informed that Dr. Horton, the medical officer in charge at Prahsoo, wrote a strong letter on the sanitary condition of that camp, recommending the withdrawal of the troops until after the rains. My informant told me that Colonel Conran was unable to do so, although he saw how desirable and necessary such a step is, because his Excellency Governor Pine, when embarking, left strict orders to Judge Hackett, the Lieut.-Governor, that the Ashantee frontiers were to be guarded, and the troops were not to be withdrawn, and he, the Judge, consequently refused to permit the withdrawal.

There is one matter, however, connected with this subject which I am sure you will excuse my alluding to, as you are not likely ever to have lost sight of it—viz., that at Cape Coast we have no beasts of burden whatever; and the natives who carry stores and merchandise along the roads travel Indian-file fashion, one after another, in tracks forming single pathways. The roads in consequence become during the heavy rainy season to a great extent covered over with bush. Nothing has a greater tendency to brutalise or deteriorate the people here than a large portion of them being employed at work which ought to be performed by beasts of burden. Now mules, camels, and donkeys, it is said, would not only live here, but their introduction would be a matter of the very greatest benefit to the country, and a very great saving to the military authorities. Hitherto, horses have not succeeded, but donkeys, mules, and camels, it is said, would thrive. A Mr. Hutton, who was formerly a merchant here, sent to Teneriffe for two camels. They sent him by mistake two donkeys (the only donkeys of the genuine species which, it is said, ever made their appearance here). As the story goes, Mr. Hutton was so much annoyed at receiving donkeys instead of camels, that he let them stray into the bush, and it is to be deplored they were never afterwards heard of.\n\nWe have had already more rain this season than has been remembered for years. Of course, the miasma all along the Coast are increased by the wet weather. The health of Cape Coast has been, indeed, wretched. No one has escaped an attack of some sort or other.

We have recommended to the War-office, with regard to troops, should they be sent out, and we recommend to all officers going out, that the systematic daily use of Lamplough's Pyretic Saline be commenced, with or without quinine, on the very day of their embarkation, so that the system may become saturated before they arrive out. Colonel Hill assured us that, by daily use of the Saline while at Sierra Leone, he was able to laugh at the African fever, though it had nine times attacked him; and we feel sure that if Sir Garnet Wolseley and the other officers recently sent out, as well as others still to be dispatched, will make daily use of the Saline, they will thank us by-and-bye for advising them to do so.

I have lived nearly ten years in the south and south-west of the United States, and found portions of that country far more malarious than the Gold Coast. During my visits to Axim I could not ascertain that any white man had died there from fever contracted on the spot during the past twelve or thirteen years. Nearly all the Government officials are stationed immediately on the coast-line, although it has been proved that the healthiness of the climate improves as one proceeds inland. At a distance of seventy to one hundred miles up the Ancobra river the features of the country change; numerous steep hills are met with, and many of the streams contain clear water running over rock and gravel beds. This is especially the case in the Appantoo, Broomassie, and Takwa districts.

In these reports are given the death and invaliding rates occurring among Europeans of all classes serving at the time on the coast. The greatest care was always taken to obtain reliable data on these subjects both from members of the medical staff and the district commissioners at out-stations, and I had every confidence in the accuracy of the reports submitted to me by these officials. I have not copies of the Blue-books by me, but they are easily obtained, and if Mr. Bridges would care to consult them he would find, from the vital statistics recorded therein, his estimate of the climate of the Gold Coast to be misleading.""\n\n[Oct. 1, 1895.\n\n---'}, {'id': 6722, 'article_title': 'THE FUTURE OF THE GOLD COAST.', 'full_section_title': 'THE FUTURE OF THE GOLD COAST.', 'last_edit_date': '03-02-1896', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1896#article-7', 'issue_date': '02_03_1896', 'content': 'The opening up of the forest country appears at present almost a hopeless task. The air is so damp that it is impossible to make clearings by burning the undergrowth, while the trees are so close, and the natives are by nature so indolent, that nothing in the way of pioneer work can be expected from native enterprise. So long as they have enough to eat, the coast and forest tribes will do nothing unless forced by the more vigorous white man. Doubtless, gold exists in abundance in this forest land, but speculators must remember that it is a very different matter prospecting for gold here as compared with the open, healthy veldt of South Africa and the thinly wooded plains of West Australia. No European could do manual labour on the West Coast and live, and even as overseers the death rate would be very high, for it is well known that where ground in the forest is disturbed, the malaria arising from it increases in deadliness. Therefore the Gold Coast cannot, under present conditions, be considered a promising region for the investor in gold or any other mines. For the same reason we must be prepared to lose some valuable lives before the projected railway is completed.\n\nIt is often remarked with astonishment, that though the British have been in possession of the Gold Coast for over two hundred years, yet our trade there has made little real progress, in striking contrast to what our race has accomplished in other parts of the world. The causes are not far to seek. The coast Natives have neither the energy nor the aptitude for trade of the Natives of India, and the only possible means of transport is the Native carrier. The country for many miles from the coast is unfitted for a white man. Hemmed in by a broad fever-laden mass of almost impenetrable forest, inhabited by more or less hostile tribes, it is little surprising that our trading stations have never left the coast line. After a short period of office, Government officials are removed to more salubrious climes, should they be lucky enough to retain their health; civilians, if they do not die, return home periodically to recruit their fever-stricken frames. Thus there is a constant stream of new officials and traders\' agents, who, before they can master the conditions of the country and carry out steps to improve the trade, are succeeded by others, and there is no continuity of policy. The only remedy for this state of affairs—and it is an expensive one—seems to be for every official and trading agent to have an ""understudy,"" ready to carry on the work without interruption when his principal leaves or is incapacitated.

We do not need to be informed that there is every desire on the part of the Government and army and medical authorities to compass this important object; what we fear is, that the men may fall victims to routine and professional prejudice. As we have pointed out in our letter to the Secretary of State for War (p. 193), the sad experience of the first batch of Marines sent out to the Coast demonstrates that our fears on this point have but too solid a foundation to rest upon. We know where the hitch is. Such medicines as Lamplough\'s Pyretic Saline and Warburg\'s Tincture are not in the Medical Pharmacopoeia. True, they are invaluable—the first to prevent, the second to cure malarious fevers—ample experience has fully demonstrated this; but there being some secret in their preparation or composition, they are not in the Pharmacopoeia; and it is more satisfactory, we suppose, that officers and men should sicken and die en règle, however valuable their lives may be, than that they should be kept in health, or restored rapidly to health and duty, by preparations which the Pharmacopoeia chooses to ignore. We feel all the gravity of the case, and should certainly not interfere, except that officers and soldiers\' lives, and health for duty, are of more importance in our eyes than professional prejudice and pride. A propos of this, Dr. Johnson, Physician to William IV., and Editor of the Medico-Chirurgical Review, wrote: ""Would any man in his senses, or who has any regard for the welfare of his patients, refuse to administer James\'s Powder, Battley\'s Sedative Liquor, or Ruspini\'s Styptic, because the inventors refuse to make known the composition of these remedies?"" We shall say very little more. The danger which these men incur, unless adequate precautions be taken, is, alas! too well known; but Lamplough\'s Pyretic Saline as a preventive, and Warburg\'s Tincture as a rapid remedy and restorer, may reduce that danger to a minimum; and ample stores of these preparations ought therefore to go with the troops. It is possible that the success or non-success of Sir Garnet Wolseley\'s efforts, will depend upon whether Government has expended a few thousand pounds for such stores. What is done, should be done now—at the very outset. It will be too late when half the officers and men have died, and the other half been disabled by malarious fevers; and a heavy responsibility will rest on those who may have neglected to profit by the lessons of past experience.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-10-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_10_1873#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.742, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sickness and Death among the Gold Coast Troops', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""are said not to be made with rosewater, campaigns in unhealthy tropical climates can never be as harmless as picnic parties.

But no; the health of the forces was good from August, 1863, until some three weeks after they had marched in several directions into the bush of the interior. The mortality and sickness has occurred only since the end of February, with few exceptions. The local error committed we deem to have been this: The rains commenced two months before their time. We think that on the very first day of rain, all idea of further duty in the field should have been abandoned, and nearly all the troops have been ordered back to Cape Coast Castle without delay. When once the rains began, no troops could go into Ashantee, and no Ashantees would come into the Territories. Again, the campaign being over, we think the Tamar's men, who would otherwise have been marched up to camp immediately, where there were rations, &c., for fifty or sixty days, ought not to have been landed, there being no adequate accommodation for them. But the great sickness and death was not among these men, but among those who had been at Prahsoo and other up-country stations.\n\nWe hope that now the party battle has been fought, men will reason calmly about events which, though deplorable, have not the gravity that has been attributed to them. We never hear it said, when some regiment in India has been sent on necessary service, and the cholera has decimated it, that Government or the authorities deserve impeachment for sending men on such an expedition. And why should the case be different in Africa? We know, by news from the camp itself, that all necessary medicines and medical comforts were there. But the exhalations of a lately uncovered soil were poisonous; as also the water, which no attempt seems to have been made to purify, though sand was abundant, and charcoal enough might have been burned in a few days to form a filter bed for an army, instead of for a mere battalion. It must be acknowledged that the absence of inventive resources to meet emergencies in campaign, which peculiarly characterises our troops, greatly increases the difficulties of Government, and leads frequently to disease and death that might have been very easily averted."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1864#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.792, 'probability_score': 0.07, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sanitariums for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'M\'Carthy\'s Island, River Gambia, Dec. 20, 1864.\n\nMy Lord,—In the editorial article in the Lancet of October 13, page 442, we find the remark that ""it is a singular fact in medical geography that from St. Louis, Senegal, on the north, to Mossamedes, on the south, there is not upon the seaboard a single healthy acre of ground. The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.775, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'West Coast Climate—Yellow Fever—Army and Navy Mismanagement', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Why, this is worse than the ill-fated encampment in the bush at Prahsu, during the so-called Ashantee campaign—a mortality there which led to the assembly of a Parliamentary committee, and the all but abandonment by us of the Protected Territories on the Gold Coast, and other West African colonies and settlements. And who does not see in the above short extracts similar causes to those which made Cape Coast so unhealthy a station, before Colonel Conran took the fever bull by the horns and restrained him by sanitary improvements; which, if adhered to and perfected as they ought to be, will reflect lasting honour on his Cape Coast rule, however seriously he may have erred in other important matters? Who does not recall to mind what made Lagos so fatally pestilential—who does not observe causes similar to those which led to the mortality in the Bristol, and to the late fever outbreak at Bathurst, Gambia? This question of the asserted deadly character of the climate of the West Coast of Africa over and above that of all other tropical or semi-tropical countries, is all-important in our eyes. As in the case of Bermuda, we cannot allow culpable official indifference and neglect at head-quarters—red-tape stupidity with obstinate ignorance in naval and military commanders—and carelessness and inefficiency in governors to decide this question for us! We believe that the West Coast countries contain what, considering their proximity to England, will necessarily make them to rank eventually among the most important possessions of the British Crown; and we cannot silently view our hold on any portion of them relaxed, because of a fever myth sedulously propagated by guilty and interested parties. The climate and the at present social influences are, no doubt, prejudicial to the health of Europeans, but by no means necessarily fatal. If the chief authorities at home will do their duty in an enlightened way—will urge constantly upon local authorities the necessity of also doing theirs—will discourage and censure every officer whose thoughtlessness or obstinate red-tapeism may lead to the sacrifice of his men\'s lives, as in the case of Bermuda, H.M.S. Bristol, or the Gambia—and will direct their efforts to a just and humane economy of health and life, by more frequent naval reliefs, and such sanitary measures on land as it is a disgrace to the British name to neglect merely because they would or might involve some slight official inconvenience, or increase of Imperial expenditure, which ought not to be allowed to weigh against all-valuable human life, we should soon cease to hear such diatribes as have lately been directed against the climate of the West Coast of Africa, whose fevers are certainly not worse than the jungle fever* of the East Indies; and energies would soon be brought into play which would within a very few years raise the exports of those West countries to England from their present two millions to ten millions of annual value, paid for in great part by British manufactures which the natives so ardently covet.

A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2. Avoid getting chilled by standing or sitting for any length of time when the body is unduly heated, or by neglecting to change underclothing as soon as possible after profuse sweating.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1887#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.729, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'West Coast Climate—Yellow Fever—Army and Navy Mismanagement', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'So furious has been the attempt to ""taboo"" or ""put down"" the West Coast of Africa because of its climate, that we have no option but to return to the subject.

Yes, here is new evidence of the fact, that the denunciations hurled by the families of victims, and by journalists ignorant in these matters, upon the climate of certain portions of the globe under British rule or power, in which British soldiers, sailors, and civilians have to serve, ought rather to be heaped on the authorities who so unnecessarily and wantonly sacrifice the lives of their fellow-subjects and fellow-servants.

W. Rowland on the sanitary condition of that island. Mr. Rowland says: ""The island is alluvial, and, being in the tropics, could not be otherwise than malarious. The level of the ground water never retires far from the surface. In the driest season it is in some wells not six feet deep; in Olowogbowo, the most elevated part of the island, at this season water is found at a depth of twenty-one feet, and the average depth, as found by the measurement of Government wells erected only in the more elevated quarters, is thirteen feet. In the rains the water is close to the surface—in some places, indeed, above it. This is very favourable for the production of malaria. There was a large mortality amongst the European population in the town. This points out the urgency for sanitary works, as most of the deaths were due to malaria. The prevention, or at least the mitigation, of this evil should be the first subject to which attention is paid. That it is possible to eradicate malaria from its most favoured haunts has been repeatedly proved. To find a remedy it must first be known what are the conditions necessary and most favourable to its development. It is not necessary to know the nature of the malarial poison if its production can be prevented, or at least curtailed: the two chief conditions are subsoil moisture and a high temperature. It is in the tropics that these conditions predominate. To combat them it is necessary to drain the subsoil and lower the temperature of the surface. Nature supplies in vegetation a simple means of attaining these ends. Pittenkofer has calculated that an oak-tree which had 751,592 leaves had from May to October an evaporation equal to 212 inches, whilst the rainfall over an area equal to that covered by the tree was only 25.6 inches, so that the evaporation was 8.3 times the rainfall. The eucalyptus in Algeria has been calculated to evaporate twelve times the rainfall. The water for evaporation is supplied from the subsoil by the roots, which penetrate in all directions. Whilst getting rid of the water from the soil, the evaporation cools the air, and the shade afforded by the trees protects the soil from the direct rays of the sun. If we acknowledge the influence of high temperature in producing malaria, the great advantage to be gained by sheltering the soil from the direct rays of the sun is evident, when we consider that when the temperature in the shade is 80°, in exposed parts it is nearly double. As a sandy soil has twice the capacity for retaining heat as humus, the disadvantage of having large unshaded sandy plains in the neighbourhood is evident. Such plains are hotbeds of malaria. These plains arise from the destruction of the forests, which is brought about partly for the purpose of supplying fuel, but mainly in order to clear the land for cultivation. The virgin soil, never particularly rich, is capable of producing crops for four or five years. The land is then deserted, and becomes overgrown with grass, which, being periodically burnt, prevents the re-growth of the forest. The exposed soil is impoverished by the heavy rainfall carrying away all the organic matter, so that further cultivation is impossible. This is notably the case about Accra, where the open plains radiate for about ten or twelve miles from the town. As a sanitary measure, it is suggested that the planting of quick-growing and shade-producing trees in the open spaces, in the compounds of houses, and the streets, should be proceeded with at once. All the streets should be shaded with trees, which should be planted so as to give the maximum shade with the minimum interference with the circulation of air. The eucalyptus has been largely used for this purpose, but it does not thrive in Lagos, owing, I think, to the poor sandy soil. One planted in the hospital compound in 1882 is now covered with flower buds, but the tree has not gained its reputed dimensions. There are many local trees that would answer our purpose better.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1888#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.722, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'So much has been said and written about the climate of West Africa, and it has been so long the fashion to abuse and condemn it without inquiry, that the medical profession, like the general public, have accepted and endorsed the common report as an established fact.

Prior to this period, the Church Missionary Society had sent three German missionaries to start work in East Africa. Johann Krapf arrived in Mombasa in 1844 and was followed by J. Rebmann in 1846 and by J.J. Erhardt in 1849. Their mission station was established at Rabai near Mombasa. By 1856 Rebmann had crossed the Nyika plain to Kilimanjaro to become the first European to see the mountain, and Krapf had gone farther south to visit the Shambaa kingdom of Kimweri and then north› wards to the Kamba country where he was the first European to be shown Mount Kenya. Erhardt and Krapf also travelled farther south to the mouth of the Ruvuma and later, after spending some time in Tanga, Erhardt was able to publish a map of East Africa containing a mass of information he had gathered on the coast about the interior, including the Great Lakes, which he represented as an inland sea. Erhardt's 'map was to be the main inspiration of Burton and Speke in their expedition of 1858'. 51 This first group of missionaries acted as pioneers; they gathered con› siderable information that was extremely valuable to those who followed them. Yet their information hardly came to the attention of the general public and it was only when Livingstone began his attacks on the Arab slave trade in speeches and writings that the popular imagination was caught. In the spirit of the capitalist free-trade conviction of his time, Livingstone was emphasizing the power of commerce, which, he believed, would integrate the vast interior with Christian Europe, thus relieving Africans of the poverty and humiliation caused by the slave trade. He therefore concentrated on travelling in search of navigable rivers, or what he called the 'open path for commerce and Christianity'.$^{52}$ The publication of his Missionary Travels$^{53}$ in 1857, together with his personal appeals, inspired the formation of the Universities Mission to Central Africa (UMCA) by a group of English High Churchmen. The UMCA attempted to follow Livingstone's ideas by trying to enter the Zambezi region, only to find that neither the Zambezi nor the"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Increased European pressures', 'content': ""The question of freed slaves attracted the attention of all missionary societies working in East Africa. Between 1858 and 1873 the CMS, UMCA and the Holy Ghost Fathers were all involved. The CMS continued to work at Rabai near Mombasa, where freed slaves from Bombay were sent to assist Rebmann. The UMCA was located in Zanzibar while the Holy Ghost Fathers worked in Bagamoyo. None of these societies had succeeded in carrying out Livingstone's mission of opening the interior for commerce and Christianity. Nevertheless, the work had begun. For, while the missions were beginning to take root on the coast, the interior of East Africa was being explored by Europeans who had been inspired by the initial efforts of these missionaries. In 1858 Burton and Speke had set out to find Erhardt's 'Sea of Unyamwezi'.$^{54}$ They reached Lake Tanganyika and Speke also visited the southern shores of Lake Victoria. In 1862 Speke returned with Grant to explore Lake Victoria, and also located the outflow of the Nile. While following the White Nile they met Samuel Baker, who had come up the river from the sea. Later Livingstone himself was to return once more to the heart of Africa, adding more to what had already been revealed. The explorations had a tremendous effect on the missionary invasion. The existence of the big lakes immediately seemed to prove the validity of Livingstone's plan. All major British missionary societies that were working in East Africa wanted to place steamers on these inland waterways. The most important stimulus derived from these explorations sprang from their revelations about the extent and character of the Arab slave trade. For it became clear that the interior was not as inaccessible as Krapf had thought of Kenya or as the UMCA missionaries had thought of the Lower Shire. Certainly caravan routes penetrated the whole interior and human cargo was getting to the coast through them. Even more significant was the revelation of what this trade implied for the lives of the Africans. . <- After Livingstone's death greater zeal was roused among British mission› ary societies. The impact of his public funeral ceremony in Westminster Abbey touched almost every pulpit and stimulated popular support for missionary work. As a result, the Scottish Free Church plunged for the first time into missionary work in Central Africa.

Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s. Nevertheless, tropical medical schools were established in Europe as early as 1897 in Liverpool and London, 1900 in Hamburg, 1901 in Brussels, followed later by Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles, and in Africa by 1912 in Cape Town and 1918 in Dakar."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.589, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""In tropical Africa governmental medicine was long a military concern although small civilian hospitals began to appear in the 1890s. From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

Increasing British and French interests in India and the Indian Ocean - in Aden, Mauritius, Madagascar and the new sultanate of Zan› zibar - were soon to have their repercussions on East Africa. It needs to be emphasized, however, that the Euro/American presence was waterborne and coast-centred. It made no appreciable penetration into the interior of the continent before 1850, whereas the major events in Africa in the early nineteenth century - the Ethiopian revival, the Mfecane, the West African djihads - were initiated from the interior of the continent, although Muhammad 'Alfs reforms in Egypt were a notable exception.\nThe missionary factor made a substantial contribution to the spectacular British success in Freetown. Responding to the challenge of the new opportunities, German missionaries, mostly from the Basel Mission but with a few from the Bremen Mission, overcame their pietist hesitation and became involved in the politics of development in a British colony. They and their British colleagues found more opportunities as farm managers, linguists, teachers, builders, and promoters of commercial enterprises than as preachers. A number of mission stations were established, and leading individual missionaries became deeply involved in local political and racial conflicts; nevertheless, nothing like the Freetown success was achieved. Elsewhere, missionary organizations were being founded, and a few pioneer mission stations established in which preliminary educational efforts and linguistic studies were being undertaken that would yield fruit later.

Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.578, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'The state of African religious life on the eve of colonial rule > Christianity in pre-colonial Africa', 'content': 'Before the onset of colonial rule, Christianity - as has been shown in the earlier volumes - had been through three phases in its history on the African continent. Its first phase ended in the seventh century with the rise of Islam, leaving scattered Christian colonies in the deserts and parts of North Africa.

The period of Portuguese explorations in the fifteenth century began the second phase; and this, too, was ended by the slave trade which followed on the heels of the explorations and lasted for nearly three centuries.

The push into the hinterland was made possible by the geographical explorations which greatly increased European knowledge of the interior of Africa. Besides, great inspiration was derived by many missionaries from the exploration and ideas of David Livingstone, who made the results of his expeditions known through his prolific writings. His view that missionaries should establish centres of Christianity and civilization which would not only promote religion but also commerce and agriculture, came to be widely shared by many enthusiastic missionaries who penetrated far into the interior of Africa, following the old trade routes. Mention must also be made of the advances that were made in medical science in the nineteenth century which led to the control of many tropical diseases and thus made it easier for missionaries to settle in many parts of Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.582, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The years from the early 1880s to the mid-iojos mark the demographic divide in Africa. At the beginning of the period the continent's population was still sparse, at least by the standards of the Old World. More signifi› cantly it probably was not growing rapidly and evidenced a vulnerability to the kind of pressures, both internal and external, which were being increasingly applied. By about 1935, the population was undoubtedly grow› ing because of increasing control over mortality, and the basis was laid for a doubling over the next third of a century which almost certainly hastened and consolidated independence.\nMany indices can be used to illustrate the changes between the two dates, and some help to explain the demographic transition. In 1880 a European presence inland from the coast was largely restricted to Algeria, where a third of a million migrants, mainly from France, Spain, Italy and Malta, had consolidated the victory of the French army, and South Africa, where a similar number of Europeans, predominantly of Dutch and English extraction, now had a vanguard as far north as the Limpopo river. (See Fig. i.i.) Elsewhere Europeans were beginning to exert control over Egypt and Tunisia, ruled some coastal populations in Senegal and the Gold Coast (now Ghana) and held such enclaves as The Gambia, Sierra Leone, Lagos, Libreville and parts of Angola and Mozambique. By 1935 European administations controlled almost the entire continent (see Fig. 12.2). The half century saw European medical science progressing from an ignorance of the cause of most of Africa's major diseases to an ability to contain or cure most of them; indeed the period ends just as the sulpha drugs were ushering in an era of chemotherapy of great significance for the continent.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

Efforts at modernization were, however, by then overshadowed by the impending threat of Italian Fascist invasion. 76 Thus the period between 1915 and 1935 witnessed a wider spread and a greater degree of economic and social change in Liberia and Ethiopia than before.

It is commonly assumed that the major constraint on population numbers in traditional societies has been the availability of food. However, E. Boserup has argued that critical population densities do not lead to a Malthusian situation but to changes in the methods of cultivation: 'the low rates of population growth found (until recently) in pre-industrial communities cannot be explained as the result of insufficient food supplies due to overpopulation, and we must leave room for other factors in the explanation of demographic trends ... medical, biological, political, etc.'$^{22}$ The African past may well have been more complex than this and the ultimate bounds may have been those of food resources, even though infrequently brought into play. The land available for farming was that land not proscribed by other uses; for instance, the nearly deserted land between warring kingdoms had alternative employment as a no-man's land. In much of the continent little land appeared to be in use at any one time, either because slash-and-burn or savanna shifting cultivation meant that most land at any given time was fallow or because hunters and food gatherers needed huge areas for their support. Only occasionally did extreme famine conditions strike, caused by drought or locusts or by the disorganization arising from war or epidemic. The crisis was usually too sudden to allow any substantial temporary invasion of the fallow,$^{23}$ and in effect the limits of the carrying capacity of the land were reached with resulting huge mortality and a drop in population numbers for decades. The pressure on the capacity of the system to produce food was usually - but not always - too short and sudden to produce the successive changes in methods of land use that Boserup describes. Such changes are most likely when population numbers push persistently against the food-producing capacity of the cultivation system either in a situation where the great peaks of mortality have been reduced by health measures or other actions or where luck or geographical conditions moderate those peaks. For decades subsequent to the crisis, populations remained well below the level at which they pressed on food supplies;$^{24}$ they grew, but only at a modest rate, because they were still subject to the ravages of fearful diseases. The rate of growth may have risen somewhat when the population was thinned out, because of the temporary reduction in the"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.577, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Only few of the colonial administrators seemed to have understood how to manage the uneasy relationship which existed between the 'traditional' and the new African elites on the one hand, and between these two sets of elites and the colonial regimes on the other. The few exceptions included, notably, General (later Marshal) Lyautey in Morocco, Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard in Northern Nigeria and Sir Gordon Guggisberg in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

Dr. Livingstone, writing to Sir R. Murchison, announces the death of a distinguished young geologist, Mr. Richard Thornton: ""Murchison Cataracts (on the Shire), April 23.—With sorrow I communicate the sad intelligence that Mr. Richard Thornton died on the 21st current. He performed a most fatiguing journey from this to Tette and back again, and that seemed to use up all his strength; for, thereafter, he could make no exertion without painful exhaustion. His object was to connect his bearings of the hills at Tette (on the Zambesi) with the mountains here. I knew nothing of his resolution till after he had left. He had resolved to go home after he had examined Zomba and the Melanje range, but on the 11th he was troubled with diarrhoea, which ran on to dysentery and fever. We hoped to the last that his youth and unimpaired constitution would carry him through, as he had suffered comparatively little from fever; but we were disappointed.

After alluding to the depopulation of the valley, and the probability of his being obliged to take to pieces the steamer, and screw her together, with the view of a sale, Dr. Livingstone thus concludes: ""Dr. Kirk and Mr. Charles Livingstone now go home.

There the preparations for a public interment were made, and on Saturday, the 18th of April, Westminster Abbey received what had been brought with so much care and toil from the Lake Districts of Eastern Africa by faithful and loving attendants. We were among the last who bade Dr. Livingstone adieu the evening he left London on that final journey to Africa, and had hoped for the pleasure of welcoming him again in life and health; and it is greatly to be deplored that he so long deferred his return as to make that return alive impossible. This was, no doubt, in part owing to that spirit of perseverance which was so marked a characteristic of the devoted traveller. But there were other considerations which, we doubt not, weighed heavily with him, and these were his own decreasing powers of endurance, which would have been a great obstacle to his undertaking another similar journey, should he leave the question of the true sources of the great Egyptian river unsolved; and, alas! the almost certainty that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain funds for such a journey. From the moment we heard of his death, we have regarded him as a victim to pecuniary difficulties—difficulties not in the present, but in that possible future, which would not fail even to magnify themselves in his mind whenever it might dwell upon them. In an account published since his burial, it appears that the greater part of the sum realized by the prodigious sale of his first published travels and explorations was expended on his steam launch, for the subsequent journey in the Zambesi country. If, therefore, when, at the very zenith of his reputation, he was under the necessity of spending his meagre private resources in preparations for another expedition, what could he have looked forward to in the future, in the event of another journey being necessary to clear up some remaining doubts? We do not know what are the intentions of the Government as regards those who were dependent on the good Doctor, and who are left but meagrely provided for. This, however, we do think, that if they do no more than that, they should repay to the family that 6,000l. which he spent on his steam launch, and other moneys disbursed by him from his own private means at that period. This 8,000l. or 10,000l. is really justly due to Dr. Livingstone's family by Her Majesty's Government, if the admiration expressed be real, and the loudly proclaimed sense of his merits and services be anything better than a sham.

Unfortunately, he missed them, as they had already set out to attack Masasi by another road. The Wagwangwara broke into the mission station before sunrise. Sellim, an old Zanzibar boy and a promising teacher, was killed, with two catechumens, a man and a woman, from Mbweni, with four children. Finding there was no resistance, the Wagwangwara chief was able to restrain his people from further slaughter. Several others were wounded, but are progressing favourably. The plunderers then seized everything they could lay hands upon. Many escaped to the forest and hills, and others to the mission-house compound, which was fortunately surrounded with a stone wall. They captured about thirty-nine or forty, but Porter succeeded in redeeming some of them as far as his barter cloth went, leaving twenty-three native Christian adults and six native Christian children still in slavery. Porter, by all accounts, has acted with great judgment and tact. He managed to come to an understanding with the chief of the robber tribe, and kept them all out of the mission-house and compound, although several attempts were made to get in for the purpose of stealing. They sacked the church, but when they heard it was the House of God they were afraid, and returned the sacred things and furniture of the church. They encamped for some time near the station, and for many days kept wandering about, but without any further molestations. They did not burn any of the mission-houses, although they have burnt all the villages around. They promised to await in the neighbourhood of Majeje, about sixty miles west of Masasi, for the ransom of the native Christians. The chief said he had power to control his people in fighting, but no power to make them restore captives without ransom. Maples or one of the others will follow the Wagwangwara, and try and recover the captives. We have since heard that the tribe have been resisted or attacked by some people, and they have gone off entirely to their own country. This will make the redemption very costly and difficult, as their own land is just to the north-east of the northern end of Lake Nyassa. Maples has a very bad foot, and probably will be unable to go, and I don\'t know who else would be able to manage it, except Mr. Porter—dear, brave fellow!

It sent out its first missionaries in January, 1878, and is consequently seven years old this autumn. Its object was to enter Central Africa by means of the great Congo, or Livingstone water-way, just then descended for the first time by Stanley, and demonstrated to be the most important and direct route into the heart of the lost continent. Its plan was to evangelise, by means of industrial mission-stations, the tribes and nations occupying the vast basin of the Congo river, and constituting at that time an almost unknown world, equalling in area the whole of the United States this side of the Rocky Mountains. Even a summary of the history of the undertaking during the past seven years, touching and stirring though it is in all its details, is impossible within the space at command. The Mission was established in connexion with no large society, with no one denomination able to supply it with ample resources; its original council was a very small one, and though some of its members were most liberal, the demands of the Mission soon surpassed its resources. The East London Institute was then led to assume the sole management and financial responsibility of the society; and despite the serious physical, financial, social, and moral obstacles lying at first in the way of the Mission, progress has been made, and satisfactory results achieved. At the outset the climate of the country proved very trying and fatal to Europeans, while the difficulties, dangers, and cost of travelling and transport were immense. Two hundred miles of cataracts and rapids made the river just where it passes through a mountainous country of no use as a highway, and the distance consequently had to be traversed on foot. Carriers had to be imported at heavy cost from a distance of a thousand miles, as the natives refused, from timidity, to act as such. Without carriers, progress was impossible in a country where money is unknown, barter goods bulky, and roads and beasts of burden alike lacking. Large outlay was consequently inevitable if the pioneers of civilization were to penetrate into the interior. The people were found to be sunk in utter ignorance and most degrading superstitions, and addicted in consequence to revolting cruelties and abominations. Their language had to be reduced to writing and systematized, and work of every kind had to be done amid incessant interruptions from sickness and death. Ten Europeans have laid down their lives in this heroic struggle during its brief course, and many others have been invalided home. Fifty brethren and sisters in all have been sent out on the staff, and yet it consists to-day of only six-and-twenty. This may give some idea of the large amount of fruitless outlay necessitated by work in such an unhealthy country.

Two years' labour brought him money enough for this purpose, and in March, 1875, he left Kimberley with ten oxen, intending to explore the Zambesi River from the Victoria Falls to its source, and then to push northward, and, if possible, to reach Darfur. He was gone twenty-one months. Repeated attacks of fever prevented him from carrying out his ambitious programme, but he was able to explore thoroughly the little-known Merutse kingdom by the help of its sovereign, King Lepopo, whose friendship he gained.

With this money and with what he earned after recovering from his illness, by giving lectures in the towns of Cape Colony and writing articles for scientific journals in Europe, he was able in 1879 to pay his passage money home and ship his scientific treasures.

He saw the book in a shop window, and was seized with a longing to possess it. He did not dare ask his parents for money enough to buy it, because he knew their income was hardly sufficient, with close economy, to support the family. At last he found means to earn a dollar and a half a month by giving lessons to children, and thus at the end of two months was able to secure the volume. When he had finished its perusal the vague purpose he had felt to see the world concentrated into a settled determination to be an African traveller. He received a good classical education, and afterwards took a course in medicine. In 1872 he got his Doctor's degree, and hastening at once to England, he took ship for the Cape of Good Hope, where he landed on the 1st of July. From Cape Town he pushed on to the diamond fields, which he reached with just five shillings in his pocket. He was no adventurer, however, relying upon a lucky find in the diggings. He believed that his knowledge of medicine would enable him to earn money enough to undertake the scientific journeys he wanted to make into the far interior of the continent; and he was not mistaken, for a few fortunate cures soon made him a famous man in his profession, and in a few weeks the tent which formed his office and dwelling was thronged with patients. By February, 1873, he found himself in possession of two thousand dollars. With this sum he bought a waggon and five horses, hired servants, and set off for the Bechuana country. He returned in April with twenty big chests of scientific specimens. His money was all gone, and his patients had found other physicians during his absence; but he courageously pitched his tent, stored his boxes of specimens, and set to work to build up a new practice.\n\nBy November, Dr. Holub was able to fit out a second expedi-\n\n*Colonel Gordon has since set off for China, but we think it likely he will later join the Supplementary Belgian Expedition.—Ed.

The latest dates of direct information with respect to the great traveller\'s movements and whereabouts will seem to the reader unversed in African distances and delays discouragingly remote.

Livingstone, it appears, when he last wrote, had been living for three months with a friendly Arab tribe, waiting for the close of a native war, before proceeding to Ujiji, with the intention of exploring Lake Tanganyika, and thence pushing on to Zanzibar. At Ujiji Livingstone would find provisions, medicine, letters, &c., and would learn the discoveries of Sir Samuel Baker.

The General History of Africa highlights that high mortality rates among Europeans were significantly reduced in the early 20th century due to sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved treatment methods for tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. This underscores the importance of health precautions and lifestyle adjustments, suggesting that factors beyond the harsh climate were responsible for health issues. The text also points out Europe's lack of medical preparedness for its African ventures, indicating inadequate personnel selection, though it does not explicitly attribute health issues to poor lifestyle choices or neglect. In contrast, The African Times articles strongly support the claim by attributing many European deaths to excessive alcohol consumption, poor diet, and a lack of adaptation to the tropical environment. The articles emphasize that Europeans often indulged in unsuitable dietary habits and were improperly selected for service, with many having impaired constitutions from other enervating climates. They argue that with proper care, such as attention to diet, sanitation, and health precautions, Europeans could maintain good health on the Gold Coast. While acknowledging the climate's challenges, such as malaria and yellow fever, the articles suggest that the climate's reputation for unhealthiness was exaggerated and that many health issues arose from personal neglect and intemperance.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths. From 50 to 80 per cent have or have had syphilis or yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm,"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.599, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm, Ascaris infections, schistosomiasis, filariasis and Guinea worm. To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease. Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively. Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s. Nevertheless, tropical medical schools were established in Europe as early as 1897 in Liverpool and London, 1900 in Hamburg, 1901 in Brussels, followed later by Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles, and in Africa by 1912 in Cape Town and 1918 in Dakar."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.054, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy of the former French, Belgian and Portuguese zones, 1914-35', 'section_title': ""The workers' burden > The crises and their repercussions > Food shortage, famine and epidemic"", 'content': ""Taken all round, however, the catastrophe was less spectacular. The famines were checked thanks to progress in transport facilities and the epidemics were halted by the first health campaign. But the fall in prices and loss of employment were everywhere cruelly felt. 'It was in the price paid to the producer that the decline made itself most heavily felt. The purchasing power of the natives was reduced to a greater extent than in any of the earlier crises.' 48 It is revealing that, in Francophone Africa, large-scale urban immigration began precisely when the great crisis occurred. Notwithstanding the overall stagnation in population growth (in AOF 14.4 million inhabitants in 1931, as compared with 14.6 million in 1936), the towns and cities began to be swollen by the massive influx of destitute peasants, in spite of the fact that the urban employment situation was also critical. In 1936, for example, there were still no more than 167000 wage-earners in AOF, which was hardly more than 1% of the population. Nevertheless, between 1931 and 1936 the populations of Dakar and Abidjan increased by 71%, while that of Conakry doubled. Even more revealing is the case of an impoverished little town in the interior like Ouagadougou which, reversing its previous trend, increased its population by one-third over the same period. The overall stagnation in population growth during this period is parti› cularly indicative of the prevailing state of poverty. For social expenditure, was, by contrast, tending everywhere to rise: the parallel increase in ex› penditure on health care, and in the number of dispensaries and treatment facilities tended effectively to curb the traditional scourges (trypanoso› miasis, venereal diseases, leprosy). By contrast, populations proved to be particularly vulnerable during the taxing period 1931-6 to epidemics ('sporadic illnesses': influenza, smallpox, etc.). It is extremely tempting to relate such increased morbidity to the state of profound distress and physical destitution in which a weakened and defenceless population found itself. 49"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.596, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The years from the early 1880s to the mid-iojos mark the demographic divide in Africa.

In 1880 a European presence inland from the coast was largely restricted to Algeria, where a third of a million migrants, mainly from France, Spain, Italy and Malta, had consolidated the victory of the French army, and South Africa, where a similar number of Europeans, predominantly of Dutch and English extraction, now had a vanguard as far north as the Limpopo river.

The half century saw European medical science progressing from an ignorance of the cause of most of Africa's major diseases to an ability to contain or cure most of them; indeed the period ends just as the sulpha drugs were ushering in an era of chemotherapy of great significance for the continent.

By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent. There were two reasons for the trade: firstly that alcohol could be produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits; secondly, in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, there were real problems about what goods would be accepted in return for the produce of Africa.$^{43}$ Mary Kingsley found the trade spirit pure and likely to do less harm than cannabis,$^{44}$ a view shared by a committee that investigated the liquor trade in içoç.$^{45}$ Spirits were distributed on a huge scale, frequently as wages.

Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.617, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A fragile population emerging from near stability', 'content': ""Confining our attention to the area outside the low fertility zone, we can hazard some reasonably good guesses about pre-modern sub-Saharan populations by employing stable population methods of analysis.

Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.575, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns against epidemic disease apparently gained some success. The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered. Yellow fever epidemics have occurred from Senegal to Sudan at unpredictable intervals. By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

Forced labour was increased after 1927 by the installation of the administrative services at Niamey and by the extension of the railway. This completely disrupted the farm calendar though the precariousness of the rains made farming times particularly important. The supplies of millet, noncompulsory, depended entirely on the local chiefs. In 1931, the refusal of the administration to lower the head tax, and its insistence on collective payment, which forced the peasants to pay also for deserters and for deceased people, led to a situation in which, as one report put it, 'entire villages vanished ... and an age group was completely decimated'$^{47}$ with, in some areas, a mortality rate of over 50%."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.559, 'probability_score': 0.048, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""One of the most common justifications for the European forward movement which began in the 1880s was that the new stable administrations reduced the mortality toll from inter-ethnic warfare and slaving raids.

In any case it was almost certainly exaggerated by both European administrators and missionaries, each seeking to justify the kind of new order that they had brought.

What was less frequently emphasized by the new regimes was the heavy loss of life arising in parts of Africa from their intervention. The deaths were rarely a product of the original extension of administration, but rather of the suppression of subsequent revolts and of the ensuing punitive expeditions which apparently often inflicted most damage because of starvation resulting from the upsetting of the subsistence farming cycle.

Most of the post-primary institutions were found in the main urban centres and in some countries most of the secondary schools were found in one town.

This is entirely wrong and the Government recognizes it.

For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour.

It is commonly assumed that the major constraint on population numbers in traditional societies has been the availability of food. However, E. Boserup has argued that critical population densities do not lead to a Malthusian situation but to changes in the methods of cultivation: 'the low rates of population growth found (until recently) in pre-industrial communities cannot be explained as the result of insufficient food supplies due to overpopulation, and we must leave room for other factors in the explanation of demographic trends ... medical, biological, political, etc.'$^{22}$ The African past may well have been more complex than this and the ultimate bounds may have been those of food resources, even though infrequently brought into play. The land available for farming was that land not proscribed by other uses; for instance, the nearly deserted land between warring kingdoms had alternative employment as a no-man's land. In much of the continent little land appeared to be in use at any one time, either because slash-and-burn or savanna shifting cultivation meant that most land at any given time was fallow or because hunters and food gatherers needed huge areas for their support. Only occasionally did extreme famine conditions strike, caused by drought or locusts or by the disorganization arising from war or epidemic. The crisis was usually too sudden to allow any substantial temporary invasion of the fallow,$^{23}$ and in effect the limits of the carrying capacity of the land were reached with resulting huge mortality and a drop in population numbers for decades. The pressure on the capacity of the system to produce food was usually - but not always - too short and sudden to produce the successive changes in methods of land use that Boserup describes. Such changes are most likely when population numbers push persistently against the food-producing capacity of the cultivation system either in a situation where the great peaks of mortality have been reduced by health measures or other actions or where luck or geographical conditions moderate those peaks. For decades subsequent to the crisis, populations remained well below the level at which they pressed on food supplies;$^{24}$ they grew, but only at a modest rate, because they were still subject to the ravages of fearful diseases.

Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

It has been rare for married men to be appointed to the Gold Coast, whether in a civil or military capacity, and still more rare for them to take their wives with them. The most moral form which one description of excess assumes is for the officer, civilian, or agent to take one or more country wives, by purchasing girls from their parents.

The facts given in my letter which especially apply to the district of Axim and that surrounding the Appantoo Mine were gathered from my own experience, and from that of gentlemen whose residence in the country equals that of the doctor, and whose veracity I have no reason to doubt. ...”'}]","[{'document_title': 'Gold Coast Gold', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following interesting and instructive letter appears in a recent issue of the *Globe* :—\n\nSir,—There is plenty of auriferous country on the Gold Coast of West Africa, much of which could be worked with profit and advantage, if exploited by experienced men, who were not hampered in their mode of operations by inexperienced directors. What brought the place into so much disrepute was not only the climate, which, although bad enough in places, can be guarded against materially by care and attention to living, but the wretched mismanagement of so many gold mining companies that were brought out during the great boom in the early eighties, causing not only much disappointment, but loss of life and much capital.\n\nI was commissioned to go out to the Gold Coast in 1881, and on my return reported favourably of the auriferous prospects of the country in some articles that appeared in *The Mining Journal*, as also in my work on ""Our Gold Supply,"" in which I pointed out how the evil effects of the climate might be mitigated by precaution. Yet a number of enthusiastic amateur managers went out to the Gold Coast to take up concessions and manage gold mines, nearly all of whom came to grief, as also the companies they represented—in fact, the West African gold boom burst up through the incapacity and folly of many who had the assurance to undertake the expenditure of capital in a business they were wholly unacquainted with, while the climate laid low many strong men, as also imprudent ones, who could not stand the climate. Some men have enjoyed good health for years on the Gold Coast, but most men feel the effects of the climate after a while, and are glad to get away from the country. To explore the West African gold country and to open up mines for profitable working require experienced, careful, and steady men, with systematic management, and special attention paid to the diet of the men employed, and their general health. European managers, mechanics, and miners who have to be sent out to the Gold Coast at great expense, require careful selecting, and to be well cared for when on the mines. The heavy and unskilled labour must be done by Natives—Kroomen, coolies, and others—who, with a little teaching, make fair workers.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1896#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'So much has been said and written about the climate of West Africa, and it has been so long the fashion to abuse and condemn it without inquiry, that the medical profession, like the general public, have accepted and endorsed the common report as an established fact. It is therefore important to find such mischievous exaggerations combated by a medical officer, who writes of West Africa, not from hearsay evidence, but from the experience derived during a residence of twenty-three years in the colony of Sierra Leone and settlements of the Gold Coast. We make these remarks by way of introducing to more general notice the papers above noted, because they supply much valuable and novel information, not only regarding the diseases to which Europeans and natives are subject in West Africa, but because they furnish an interesting description of the topography of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.\n\nMr. Clarke is of opinion that the climate of West Africa, if fairly tested, can stand comparison in point of healthfulness with most of our colonies in the East or West Indies, where endemic and epidemic fevers, dysentery, with cholera to boot, prevail quite as frequently and fatally. There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years. Comparatively, their number is not small, comprehending persons of all classes—governors, civil and military officers, merchants, and missionaries, with their wives and families. He states ""that formerly many officers in the English, Dutch, and Danish service resided upon the Gold Coast, some fourteen, twenty, and thirty years,* and enjoyed good health, although those in subordinate positions had to remove from one station to another."" The fact ought no longer to be concealed, that half at least of the deaths and incapacities which occur amongst Europeans arise from errors of personal economy, and that the mortality lists are unfairly swelled by ascribing to the climate deaths which have been caused by accident or intemperance.\n\nThe following passages may be adduced as proof that the climate is not to blame for everything:—', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of West Africa—Gold Mining—The Labour Question', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It is a remarkable fact that the Spaniards, Portuguese, and Frenchmen who live on the Coast, and who, as a general rule, live far less liberally than do the residents who are natives of the United Kingdom or America, show a much larger sick list and a much higher death rate than the men of the Anglo-Saxon race. It is generally agreed that this is to be attributed to our superior mode of living, for the Spaniards, Portuguese, and Frenchmen are generally as hardy and as strong as we are.\n\nThe Chairman advised Europeans to adopt a diet of ""rice, weak tea, and mild tobacco."" Well, any white man who went in for such a diet should be either made of cast iron—if such a being could be manufactured—or else must be an idiotic candidate for a suicide\'s grave. Why, Kroomen cannot exist continually on rice; their diet has to be changed, in their own country, to corn, and, in factories down the Coast, to biscuit, with a free allowance of beef. A twelvemonth\'s diet of rice produces in most Kroomen valvular disease of the heart, with dropsy of the extremities and abdomen, and if the case is not treated at once, on the first signs of swelling in the feet, by change of diet, with medicine, death follows in a few days. Perhaps the Chairman can stand a diet that will kill a Krooman?\n\nWith regard to longevity of life in Africa, and the time a man can stay out without change of climate, much depends on where he resides. In Gambia, men have resided seven years at a time without leaving the place. On the Southwest Coast, men like Mr. Walker have resided three or more years without going to Europe or Madeira; while in the Bights three years is a long spell—eighteen months to two years being about the average time. Then a man, if he is even not very ill, feels the climate has so tried him that a few months\' change to the north is absolutely necessary. The same rule applies to the Gold, Ivory, and Grain Coasts. But it is more than likely that on elevated ground, say fifty miles up the country, on these coasts, like the station of the Swiss Mission, near Ackra, that men could reside in very decent health for much longer periods, provided they have good food—fresh food, not tinned.\n\nHalf the mortality in the towns of the Gold Coast is caused by want of proper sanitation. Where every native yard is a private cemetery, where in such yards cesspools, years old, are the rule, and the ground is saturated with sewage, where water has to be stored in tanks, and is bad—how can the towns be healthy, under a tropical sun? With any quantity of land in the neigh\n\nhood of such towns, there is no public cemetery for the natives. With the towns elevated above the sea, and washed by the surf of the Atlantic, there is no attempt at proper drainage, and the removal of sewage to the sea. The native prejudice as regards interments and dirt, must be respected, or the boasted liberty of the British subject would be infringed; and then a proper system of burial and drainage would cost money!', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sickness and Death among the Gold Coast Troops', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""are said not to be made with rosewater, campaigns in unhealthy tropical climates can never be as harmless as picnic parties. And when and how did these officers (and men) contract their fatal diseases? If their disease had been owing to immediate Government neglect, they would have been victims soon after their arrival. But no; the health of the forces was good from August, 1863, until some three weeks after they had marched in several directions into the bush of the interior. The mortality and sickness has occurred only since the end of February, with few exceptions. The local error committed we deem to have been this: The rains commenced two months before their time. We think that on the very first day of rain, all idea of further duty in the field should have been abandoned, and nearly all the troops have been ordered back to Cape Coast Castle without delay. When once the rains began, no troops could go into Ashantee, and no Ashantees would come into the Territories. Again, the campaign being over, we think the Tamar's men, who would otherwise have been marched up to camp immediately, where there were rations, &c., for fifty or sixty days, ought not to have been landed, there being no adequate accommodation for them. But the great sickness and death was not among these men, but among those who had been at Prahsoo and other up-country stations.\n\nWe hope that now the party battle has been fought, men will reason calmly about events which, though deplorable, have not the gravity that has been attributed to them. We never hear it said, when some regiment in India has been sent on necessary service, and the cholera has decimated it, that Government or the authorities deserve impeachment for sending men on such an expedition. And why should the case be different in Africa? We know, by news from the camp itself, that all necessary medicines and medical comforts were there. But the exhalations of a lately uncovered soil were poisonous; as also the water, which no attempt seems to have been made to purify, though sand was abundant, and charcoal enough might have been burned in a few days to form a filter bed for an army, instead of for a mere battalion. It must be acknowledged that the absence of inventive resources to meet emergencies in campaign, which peculiarly characterises our troops, greatly increases the difficulties of Government, and leads frequently to disease and death that might have been very easily averted."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1864#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In the Government Blue-book relative to the comparative health, &c., of seamen employed on various stations throughout the world there is the following relative to the climate of the West Coast, by Assistant-Surgeon J. Lambert, of the Espoir, which confirms the statements we have always made on the subject: ""I do not think the Coast, either ashore or afloat, nearly so unhealthy as it is constantly represented to be. On shore, from the little I have seen of it, Englishmen act very much as if they were at home, and indeed sometimes much more loosely; they smoke and imbibe alcoholic stimulants too much, and indulge especially in other forms of dissipation, which are all debilitating causes, preparing the way for the inroads of malaria. They do not look on themselves as belonging to another clime, and requiring special care and great attention to all those hygienic rules which apply with greater or less force wherever our race wanders, be it in the healthiest places possible, so far as external agencies are concerned, but which apply with especial force where, as here, many of the surrounding agencies are inimical to a healthy action of the animal functions. With temperance in diet, stimulants, and, generally, personal cleanliness as well as surrounding cleanliness, a free interchange of air in dormitories, exercise in the open air, and a moderate exposure to the sun, I think Europeans, fully grown and with sound constitutions, could remain many years on the Coast, and return to Europe without much impairment of health. This would be very much more true could merchants choose their trading stations. For obvious reasons at present the mouths of the rivers are chosen, which above all are the most unhealthy places, especially as in many cases pure water cannot be had, and river water, often impure, is used for all purposes. Afloat, with little communication with the shore, no general leave at notoriously unhealthy places, using distilled water, or good spring water when it can be had without exposing the men to too much fatigue or malaria, avoiding river waters, and rarely entering them; a free use of quinine when required; doing away with boat cruising, more berthing accommodation, a liberal supply of fresh beef and vegetables, allowing the men to buy stock at the various places, less drill aloft, great attention to personal cleanliness and the general cleanliness of the ship, I feel sure, putting aside the so-called infectious epidemics, which ought rarely to occur, the health of the cruisers would be as good as on any station, and better than on many.""', 'last_edit_date': '1869-04-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1869#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Gold Coast Colony', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Recent events have called attention to this hitherto much-neglected Colony. Although our connexion with it has been for a period approaching two and a-half centuries, so little notice has been given to it that it is in almost as undeveloped a state as when we first came into contact with its peoples. Perusal of the letters and articles from correspondents who recently accompanied the Ashanti expedition on its march from Cape Coast Castle to Coomassie brings forcibly to one\'s mind how sadly we have been lacking in our duty in this sphere. Rich almost beyond compare in mineral and vegetable products, this field of wealth has been permitted to remain all but uncultivated. No strenuous efforts appear to have been made to open up the country; there are no roads to speak of, there are no facilities for inland transport—even at this day every gallon of palm oil, every hundredweight of rubber, every fathom of cloth, and every pound of gunpowder has to be carried on men\'s heads to and from the interior, and this in a land abounding in auriferous metal. One naturally asks—Why should this be so? The answer is not far to seek. There are several causes which account for the backwardness of the Colony, the main being the reputed unhealthiness of the climate. On this point there cannot be any doubt as to its not being favourable to Europeans, especially if they come here with constitutions in any way enervated by previous excesses, or if they indulge in excesses of any kind while here. It is imprudent for a white man to come to West Africa unless his constitution is perfectly sound and every organ in his body unimpaired; but if he is in perfect health, and will exercise ordinary care, take good food, live regularly, practice sobriety, work hard when he is at it, and will not (to use a vulgarism) funk when he has a touch of fever, he will run no greater risk on the Gold Coast than in other tropical countries. There are many Europeans known to the writer who have been in this country eight, ten, fifteen, twenty-five, and thirty years and more, with periodical visits home, and who in the majority of cases have remained in the Colony three, five, and seven years at a stretch; yet in none of these instances were the parties total abstainers, but they were temperate in all things and enjoyed perfect health. Yet these men lived in times when less attention was bestowed to sanitary matters. With ordinary care the healthy European runs no risk. Now the authorities are becoming alive to the necessities of better sanitation, and some efforts are being made to improve the sanitary condition of the principal sea-coast towns. That the country has suffered in no inconsiderable degree by its reputation for unhealthiness is evidenced by this passage which I cite from an official source: ""Against the development of the Colony by means of English capital there lies upon it the stigma of a baneful climate. But I cannot help thinking that by clearing the waterways of the Colony and thus improving the drainage of the country, by converting the bush tracks into decent roads and so improving the ventilation of the country, by a gradual conversion of the dense bush into cultivated areas, by the enforcement in the interior towns and villages of the sanitary laws which have proved so useful and advantageous in the coast towns, and by improving the means of transport, thereby enabling Europeans resident at a distance from the trade ports to have ready access to good food and the various comforts of civilisation to which they have been accustomed, and which they more than ever want in a tropical country—the climate of the Gold Coast will lose its notoriety, and the country will become, equally with other tropical countries, a safe means for the investment of capital."" But beside the climate the greatest hindrance to the rapid development of the country and its trade has been the want of proper means of transport. So long as the primitive method of carrying everything on the head prevails, the amount of trade must necessarily be narrowed still the volume of trade for 1894 shows an increase roughly of 13 per cent. over 1893 with the United Kingdom, and of 22 per cent. with foreign countries, being respectively £1,190,532 1s. 3d. against £1,054,386 17s. 6d., and £429,708 1s. 4d. and £350,387 3s. 5d. This gives one some idea of what the increase is certain to be when the produce-yielding districts of the colony are tapped by good roads and the ""iron horse."" The Government, it is said, are organising a roads department, and surveys have been made for railroads, none too soon, for they are indispensable in a country where cattle (including in that category horses, mules, and donkeys) will live only in certain localities. Irrespective of the necessity for roads and railways for produce, the same facilities for access to the gold mining districts cannot be lost sight of; it is the yellow metal which has given its name to the colony. Since the fifteenth century it is estimated that six or seven millions of gold have been exported from the goldfields. Anterior to the discovery of Australian or Californian gold the principal supply of the auriferous metal was obtained from the West Coast, in particular from this land. Whoever has travelled over the country has been struck with indications of the precious metal almost everywhere. It outcrops in reefs, it is discovered in sand, and found in the beds of its rivers; you will see it being washed for in the streets. Why, then, has not the country become a great gold mining centre? I doubt very much whether California itself ever presented to the naked eye the tempting wealth of gold which so forcibly attracts the attention of the traveller in the western districts of the Gold Coast. With plenty of capital for the developments of its properties and under European and native control, any enterprise for the development of the gold industry in this colony ought to be a substantial success.—*Liverpool Journal of Commerce.*', 'last_edit_date': '1896-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1896#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of West Africa—Gold Mining—The Labour Question', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Now, first, as regards the climate and mode of living. With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE CLIMATE OF THE GOLD COAST', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following is taken from an article from the pen of Dr. J. A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2. Avoid getting chilled by standing or sitting for any length of time when the body is unduly heated, or by neglecting to change underclothing as soon as possible after profuse sweating.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1887#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—I read the paragraph in your paper of this month under the above title, and can add my testimony to the value of “Lamplough’s Pyretic Saline,” if not as a sure preventive, certainly as a deterrent and palliative in African fevers.\n\nIn your remarks, however, I find no mention made of the probable causes of such mortality, which I think is necessary when speaking of the effects of a climate like West Africa, the bad reputation of which is so very much exaggerated. Nor do you make any distinction between the colonies, classing Sierra Leone with Lagos, Gambia, and Cape Coast, which I am sure the facts would not warrant.\n\nTo revert, however, to the causes of mortality on the West Coast of Africa, I am of opinion that there are many influential causes conducing to the same which might be prevented, and I take the liberty of intruding on your valuable space to enumerate one or two of them.\n\n1. The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics. In Brazil, no doubt, some Europeans drink themselves to death, but they are few; the majority, being of a better class, prefer to live well and to enjoy themselves rationally, without making beasts of themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'HEALTH ON THE WEST COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Recently, in the House of Commons, Mr. Price asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies whether he has any confirmation of the report that during the first seven months of 1896, out of about twenty English officials in the colony of Sierra Leone, there were three deaths and five cases in which the officials had to be invalided home; whether officials have to serve fifteen months at Sierra Leone before obtaining leave, whereas in the Gold Coast Colony they have only to serve twelve months; and whether, seeing that Europeans are particularly subject to illness during the later months of their stay on the coast, the Colonial Office can see its way to making the rules as to leave in Sierra Leone the same as in the Gold Coast Colony.\n\nThe Right Hon. J. Chamberlain, the Secretary for the Colonies, in reply, said: ""I regret to state during the months in question, which were exceptionally unhealthy, no less than five deaths occurred among the English civil officials, of whom there are about thirty, and three were invalided home, besides two (including the Governor) who were invalided to the Canary Islands.

I have lived nearly ten years in the south and south-west of the United States, and found portions of that country far more malarious than the Gold Coast. During my visits to Axim I could not ascertain that any white man had died there from fever contracted on the spot during the past twelve or thirteen years. Nearly all the Government officials are stationed immediately on the coast-line, although it has been proved that the healthiness of the climate improves as one proceeds inland. At a distance of seventy to one hundred miles up the Ancobra river the features of the country change; numerous steep hills are met with, and many of the streams contain clear water running over rock and gravel beds. This is especially the case in the Appantoo, Broomassie, and Takwa districts. During my last journey I stayed several days at the Appantoo Mine, and gathered that, although for the past two years there had been on an average ten white men constantly employed, yet during the whole of that period not one man had died, and in the aggregate not more than two weeks\' time had been lost through sickness.""\n\nMr. J.

I shall content myself with referring to my last three or four sanitary reports on the Gold Coast, which will be found in the Blue-books at the Colonial Office, in which are included the vital statistics of the Coast gathered with care from the most reliable sources, and submitted to the Governor of the Colony, for the information of the Secretary of State. In these reports are given the death and invaliding rates occurring among Europeans of all classes serving at the time on the coast. The greatest care was always taken to obtain reliable data on these subjects both from members of the medical staff and the district commissioners at out-stations, and I had every confidence in the accuracy of the reports submitted to me by these officials. I have not copies of the Blue-books by me, but they are easily obtained, and if Mr. Bridges would care to consult them he would find, from the vital statistics recorded therein, his estimate of the climate of the Gold Coast to be misleading.""\n\n[Oct. 1, 1895.\n\n---', 'last_edit_date': '1895-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1895#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CHRISTIANITY AND THE OTHER RELIGIOUS SYSTEMS ON THE GOLD COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Gold Coast Settlement, though about 237 years old, yet is barely emerging from infantine imbecility, still suffering from various privations and disabilities, with inland countries still impenetrable beyond a few miles from the sea-coast; agriculture in a yet languishing state; commerce still in its early dawn; districts woefully distracted by faction and disaffection; famine threatens if few crops cultivated are exported; very few roads, and foot-paths almost impassable; streams and brooks with no bridges over them; the mass of the people depressed by poverty; their morals in the lowest state of debasement, and the Christian religion disregarded and almost looked upon with scorn, consequent upon the demoralizing influence exercised by the false religions throughout the settlement.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1885#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel.

By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent. There were two reasons for the trade: firstly that alcohol could be produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits; secondly, in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, there were real problems about what goods would be accepted in return for the produce of Africa.$^{43}$ Mary Kingsley found the trade spirit pure and likely to do less harm than cannabis,$^{44}$ a view shared by a committee that investigated the liquor trade in içoç.$^{45}$ Spirits were distributed on a huge scale, frequently as wages.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Europe still went in fear of the corsairs of the Maghrib. If Neapolitan sailing ships were making for the coast and caught sight of a Tunisian or Tripolitanian flag, their crews were quick to make their escape.

The purchasing power of the natives was reduced to a greater extent than in any of the earlier crises.' 48 It is revealing that, in Francophone Africa, large-scale urban immigration began precisely when the great crisis occurred. Notwithstanding the overall stagnation in population growth (in AOF 14.4 million inhabitants in 1931, as compared with 14.6 million in 1936), the towns and cities began to be swollen by the massive influx of destitute peasants, in spite of the fact that the urban employment situation was also critical. In 1936, for example, there were still no more than 167000 wage-earners in AOF, which was hardly more than 1% of the population. Nevertheless, between 1931 and 1936 the populations of Dakar and Abidjan increased by 71%, while that of Conakry doubled. Even more revealing is the case of an impoverished little town in the interior like Ouagadougou which, reversing its previous trend, increased its population by one-third over the same period.

Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'Much the same doubts could be cast on another of the trade goods, guns.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well.

The last measure was the only one to the advantage of the masses (al-$^{l}$atnma); all the other reforms benefited only the middle class, mainly traders, and had the effect of increasing the tax burden of the ordinary people. Their social and economic effects remained fairly limited, however. Despite the growing volume of imported European goods after 1850, the economy remained healthy. Local industry stood up well to competition, and a balanced budget continued to be ensured thanks to esparto exports. 89 But the continual food shortage from 1881 to 1889 was the first sign of far-reaching change. Exports suffered. In addition, the market price of esparto collapsed, the volume of imported foodstuffs increased and from 1892 onwards the balance of trade showed a deficit. This deficit assumed huge proportions and became permanent after 1897. For, from that time onwards, the food requirements of the masses changed. Imported tea, sugar, flour and tobacco were widely consumed in large quantities. Then the income from Saharan trade dried up. Borno ceased to be a source of trade in 1895; Kano in 1903.90 The Sanusiyya was also in difficulty in Barka and after 1901 was weakened by its military operations in Chad. The order became a big landowner in 1902 to make up for the losses foreseen on the trans-Saharan trade, thereby alienating some of its supporters. Lastly, the order was unsuccessful in holding its own against rival orders proselytizing in the region. Around 19 10 the Sanusiyya had fewer settlements than in 1853-91 Under these circumstances, the wealthy European firms that had been established in Tripoli, and also in Benghazi, found it easy to work them¬ selves into good positions.

The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours. This route also linked Yorubaland with Borgu, Hausaland, Borno and beyond. The Christian missionary journeys across the wide expanse of Yorubaland from north to south and east to west and between Yorubaland and Dahomey were made possible because the necess› ary interconnecting routes already existed.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The diaspora in Europe', 'content': 'This community of Africans in Europe was also concentrated in certain occupations, especially domestic service, this being partly a carry-over from the occupational status of Africans who came by way of West Indian slavery, partly a reflection of the European fad for exotic servants. African sailors were also common by this time in the merchant service, though more so in Portugal than in France or Britain. Another significant, if smaller, group was made up of students, who began to arrive in Europe in significant numbers by the middle of the eighteenth century and, in increasing numbers, throughout the nineteenth century. In an era in which commercial contact between Europe and Africa was increasing, it was an obvious advantage to African traders to be literate in a Western language and to have some acquaintance with European accounting practices. Many of these students therefore came to Europe through the good offices of European slave-traders operating in Africa and studied under their care in the principal slave-trade ports like Liverpool or Nantes.\nStill another peculiarity of the African communities in Europe was the fact that they were overwhelmingly male. This fact had two important implications. The African community was not self-sustaining. It had to be, and was, constantly replenished from overseas. This is not to say that the Africans had no sexual relations with European women, but the products of these relationships tended to be culturally European rather than African. After a few generations, the African physical appearance tended to disappear into the general European genetic pool.\nSome Africans also found their way into Eastern Europe, in spite of a more attenuated maritime contact with tropical Africa itself. There, the main line of entry was by way of the Ottoman slave trade, which was not mainly a trade in North Africans, but included sub-Saharan Africans drawn across the Sahara to Ottoman-associated ports like Tripoli, or brought north down the Nile from what is now the southern Sudan.$^{32}$ In a few instances, small pockets of African culture persisted in parts of the Ottoman empire into the twentieth century, such as a small Hausa-speaking com› munity in what is now Yugoslavia.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Demography and population movements', 'content': 'The effects of this loss of population are still to be fully explored, and remain a subject of speculation and of active controversy.$^{6}$ Although the rapid expansion of population against the background of inelastic resources and stagnant, or diminishing, productivity is today regarded as one of the most prominent features of underdevelopment,$^{7}$ that is so in the context of a structurally dependent economy.

He was also summoned for not serving out the requisite quantity every day, and for not entering the illness of two seamen in the official log, for each of which offences he had incurred a penalty of 5l.

It appeared from Mr. Arbuthnot\'s opening statement that in February last the Cecilia started on a voyage from London to the West Coast of Africa. She lay at Lagos four or five weeks. The crew consisted of nine, and the Captain purchased 12 bottles of lime-juice, which would last about 50 days. The voyage lasted between five and six months. In consequence of the deficiency of lime-juice the crew fell ill from scurvy and fever. On June 18 the supply ceased, and they had none during the remainder of the voyage.

Continuous heavy weather was experienced, and when off the coast of Portugal a tremendous sea struck the vessel, washing the mate overboard, carrying away the skylight, and nearly filling the ship. By a fortunate chance, the mate was brought near the ship by the backwash of the wave, and he was recovered. Simultaneously with this casualty, the vessel was dismasted by the wind, and, after being in a helpless condition for more than a week, she drifted into Teneriffe, where the necessary repairs were effected, and the vessel sailed again for her destination. During the passage between the River Nun and the Gaboon the whole of the crew (which was chiefly composed of coloured men) was stricken down with Coast fever, with the exception of the chief officer, a white man. The captain was also attacked by the malady. This state of affairs continued for several days, the working of the vessel being performed solely by the chief mate. On the fourth day after the outbreak one of the sick sailors, who were lying promiscuously all over the deck, crawled along to where the mate was steering and requested him to go forward, as one of the men was dying. The mate lashed down the wheel and went to the spot indicated, and was just in time to receive the dying words of one poor fellow to his mother. He died shortly afterwards, and his body was sewn in canvas and committed to the deep by the mate, the crew, from weakness, being unable to give any material assistance. Fortunately a spell of calm weather set in, and after being at the wheel forty-eight hours without intermission, the mate brought the vessel into the Gaboon river, where the crew received medical treatment from the French authorities. Ultimately they recovered, and after taking in a cargo of barwood, the vessel sailed for the United Kingdom. From the first the ship was badly found, and from lack of funds the master was unable to reprovision the vessel. A French gentleman, however, became a passenger, and the money paid by him was expended in obtaining fresh supplies of food. When about eight weeks out from the Coast the provisions ran short, and the allowance of the crew was greatly reduced. This curtailment continued for about five weeks, and the pinch of necessity was so rigidly felt that it was determined to make food of about sixty parrots, the majority of them being the property of the French passenger, who had brought them to a high state of training. After this the rats, rendered bold by hunger, came upon the deck in large numbers; they were killed by the cat, and afterwards eaten by a portion of the crew, who were becoming ravenous by starvation. Eventually, after all these hardships, the J. Bickmore arrived at Queenstown, when she was immediately seized by the Admiralty for debt. The crew on arrival were in a wretched condition from exhaustion, caused by hunger, and were placed under medical treatment. The vessel now lies under detention at Queenstown, pending legal proceedings.'}, {'id': 3415, 'article_title': 'A Scurvy-stricken Ship', 'full_section_title': 'A Scurvy-stricken Ship', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1877#article-16', 'issue_date': '01_10_1877', 'content': 'The ship Andaluza, of Glasgow, Captain Anderson, has arrived at Falmouth from the West Coast of Africa, with most of the crew sick from scurvy.

It is dreadful to think what they have to endure. The supercargoes also have their share of suffering; many go reluctantly to the mission houses when they are ill, as there are no other places to go to, and, alas, how many die for want of proper attention. Why can't a hospital or hulk be provided for the sick, with a proper doctor and a white man and his wife from home, with a few Sierra Leone or Accra men to nurse and attend on them? There is a fine site in this place; where the old court-house stood would make a fine place for a hospital.\n\nInstead of those stupid monuments built at home for memorials, why not build a seamen's hospital instead in these African rivers, where such princely fortunes are made. I do hope that some kind friend will take up the cause of this unfortunate class of people, and make their sick and dying hours at least more comfortable. Dr. Hewan had spoken to the Liverpool merchants some years ago, I think, of the necessity of having a hospital in this river for sick seamen, but he never returned, and years have now rolled on and nothing been done. Not long ago I was told by a medical man that a seaman died in the river at night for want of proper attendance or no attendance at all; and this is far from being an isolated case. Another time a man was sinking in fever; wine was ordered, and not a drop was to be had. There ought to be more than one medical man in each river. Frequently there is only one; he gets ill from over-work, and has to go home, and then there is not one until another comes out.

It was a most distressing sight to witness the arrival of these poor creatures; and it is necessary to make a few preliminary remarks in order clearly to understand the difficulties with which the medical officers had to contend. The appearance of the slaves when landed was most striking. In some the expression of the countenance indicated sufferings, moral and physical, of the most profound and agonising nature. Others of them gazed vacantly around them in the most utter helplessness. Occasionally, among the newly-arrived groups all sense of suffering was merged in melancholic or raving madness. The wizened, shrunk, and skinny features were lighted up by the hollow, feverish eye. The belly was, as it were, tacked to the back, whilst the hip-bones protruded, and, in some cases, became the seat of foul, sloughing ulcers. The hand and skinny fingers seemed much elongated by the great and neglected growth of the nails, and they were so deplorably emaciated, that the skin appeared tensely stretched over, and tied down to the skeleton. The legs refused to perform their functions, and they reeled and tottered about from sheer debility. Their squalor and extreme wretchedness was heightened, in many cases, by the particoloured evacuations with which their bodies were besmeared. When large numbers of the sick were suffering from dysentery, the condition of the wards and yards in the morning was extremely loathsome. This was in a great degree unavoidable, as the sick were too weak to crawl from their mats to the commode, although everything was done under the surgeons\' orders to keep the wards as clean and wholesome as the crowded state of the hospital would admit of."" In a word, ""the moral and physical causes of depression were often so overwhelming, and so intensely concentrated, that the combination produced disease in such formidable shapes as to be beyond remedy. The mortality was consequently very great; many persons brought to the hospital in the last stage of disease died a few hours after their arrival; others even expired by the way. A large proportion died within a few days; and as the names of all these persons were recorded in the hospital books, the percentage of deaths was thereby largely increased.""\n\n*(To be continued.)*', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Outbreak of Fever in the West African Squadron', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We are enabled to state that, according to the latest accounts received, the fatal cases of fever have been confined to the Active, flying the broad pendant of Commodore Sir William Hewett, V.C., K.C.B.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sanitariums for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'But Western Africa has hitherto not been thought worthy of much consideration and attention, and therefore officers who have been sent to command the troops in it have scarcely any means for preserving their health.

This last gave as his opinion, ""that a few thousands spent at Cameroons or Fernando Po would, calculating only the market value of seamen\'s lives, repay themselves in as many years."" But the pros and cons of that lofty range as a sanitarium must be considered, and officers on the Coast should be consulted before the Home Government attempt to spend a large amount on it. There are many advantages in its favour, as may be seen described in the work of Captain Burton, on ""Abeokuta and the Cameroons,"" but there are also some great disadvantages attaching to it as a military sanitarium.\n\nIts distance from the different military stations on the Coast is one great objection, as it is situated about 400 miles below the last—viz., Lagos. It will be no great consolation for a sick officer—laid up, perhaps, with intractable fever, debility, diarrhœa, or dysentery, to be ordered, say, from the Gambia or Sierra Leone, to the Cameroons Mountains, a distance of about 2,000 miles, in a steam-packet, which is most uncomfortable, and unadapted for the conveyance of the sick during a voyage of eighteen days, in a direction quite opposite to the accustomed route—viz., to Teneriffe, Madeira, or England. The result would be found invariably to be that most of the cases, and certainly all the serious dysenteric cases, would succumb before the patient could reach the mountain of good hope. As a naval sanitarium it would be excellent, as it is in the neighbourhood of the rendezvous of the West African squadron, extending from the Volta to the Island of Ascension; and of the great oil rivers, to which so many English merchant vessels resort.

Lambert, of the Espoir, which confirms the statements we have always made on the subject: ""I do not think the Coast, either ashore or afloat, nearly so unhealthy as it is constantly represented to be. On shore, from the little I have seen of it, Englishmen act very much as if they were at home, and indeed sometimes much more loosely; they smoke and imbibe alcoholic stimulants too much, and indulge especially in other forms of dissipation, which are all debilitating causes, preparing the way for the inroads of malaria. They do not look on themselves as belonging to another clime, and requiring special care and great attention to all those hygienic rules which apply with greater or less force wherever our race wanders, be it in the healthiest places possible, so far as external agencies are concerned, but which apply with especial force where, as here, many of the surrounding agencies are inimical to a healthy action of the animal functions. With temperance in diet, stimulants, and, generally, personal cleanliness as well as surrounding cleanliness, a free interchange of air in dormitories, exercise in the open air, and a moderate exposure to the sun, I think Europeans, fully grown and with sound constitutions, could remain many years on the Coast, and return to Europe without much impairment of health. This would be very much more true could merchants choose their trading stations. For obvious reasons at present the mouths of the rivers are chosen, which above all are the most unhealthy places, especially as in many cases pure water cannot be had, and river water, often impure, is used for all purposes. Afloat, with little communication with the shore, no general leave at notoriously unhealthy places, using distilled water, or good spring water when it can be had without exposing the men to too much fatigue or malaria, avoiding river waters, and rarely entering them; a free use of quinine when required; doing away with boat cruising, more berthing accommodation, a liberal supply of fresh beef and vegetables, allowing the men to buy stock at the various places, less drill aloft, great attention to personal cleanliness and the general cleanliness of the ship, I feel sure, putting aside the so-called infectious epidemics, which ought rarely to occur, the health of the cruisers would be as good as on any station, and better than on many.""', 'last_edit_date': '1869-04-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1869#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'So much has been said and written about the climate of West Africa, and it has been so long the fashion to abuse and condemn it without inquiry, that the medical profession, like the general public, have accepted and endorsed the common report as an established fact.

By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent. There were two reasons for the trade: firstly that alcohol could be produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits; secondly, in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, there were real problems about what goods would be accepted in return for the produce of Africa.$^{43}$ Mary Kingsley found the trade spirit pure and likely to do less harm than cannabis,$^{44}$ a view shared by a committee that investigated the liquor trade in içoç.$^{45}$ Spirits were distributed on a huge scale, frequently as wages.

In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy.

Figures can be given of overall losses for the whole of Central Africa,$^{7}$ but it is unlikely that it will ever be possible to give a geographical breakdown, especially as the continual movement of groups and individuals spread the impact of the slave trade far and wide.\nThere were also ecological and epidemiological factors. The nineteenth century certainly saw the beginnings of medical progress in Central Africa, such as better knowledge of endemic diseases, use of vaccination and more general use of quinine. But this progress remained confined to the circles visited by traders from Angola or the Swahili coast. By and large the changes were too limited to defeat the major endemic diseases or epidemic outbreaks. 8"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.586, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A basis for the future', 'content': ""Finally, it is pertinent to ask whether these massive changes were largely or even entirely the result of the colonial penetration. Without doubt the upsetting of stable populations, leading in the Congo Free State and elsewhere in Middle Africa to an upsurge in the death rate, the slow reduction in mortality in other parts of the continent during the nineteenth century and generally in this century, and the accelerating nucleation of population in towns and on mining fields owed nearly everything to the industrial revolution and to increasing contact with people from industrial societies. Much of this process would have occurred even without colonial rule: the traders would have provoked trading centres into growth; European medical schools would have become interested in the problem of protecting the traders and others from tropical disease; missionaries would have laid the foundations of a hospital system.\nNevertheless, direct colonial rule certainly speeded up all these processes. Eventually, and certainly towards the end of our period, it helped to reduce the great peaks of mortality by increasingly and effectively importing and utilizing epidemic control technology and creating a modern transport system which could distribute food in areas of famine. The need for administrative centres provided a nucleus for new towns, and colonial administrations' guarantees of personal safety and investment security to the nationals of their metropolitan countries hastened the growth of com› mercial settlements, mining camps and plantations. Without colonial administrations European entrepreneurs might well have been even more rapacious and murderous than they were. Europeans usually justified the colonial penetration by pointing to these achievements. Yet the history of Latin America and China shows that in time most of these gains would have been achieved in any case; the growth of industrialization was irreversible and a modus vivendi with Africa and other developing areas, from which needed raw materials were secured, was essential."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.531, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'This inflation of loss rates, even when applied to the low population estimates, does not produce total African levels for the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries above 1.3 and 0.7 respectively.

When restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, the rates become 1.4 and 0.8 respectively; while a further restriction to one-third of this population yields levels of 4.2 and 2.9. These latter rates might well produce population decline or halt a tendency towards growth, in the absence of other substantial changes tending to move the balance of vital rates towards growth, for natural increase in pre-modern societies rarely seems to have averaged levels as high as 0.4 per cent for long periods. The area of certain population decline was the coast from Cabinda to Luanda and the country behind it during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

It may have remained constant, as the evidence of the age structure recorded over fifty years by the censuses of the Gold Coast and Ghana suggest.

The other is the possibility that the population has not been stationary, but has been averaging a rate of growth of up to 0.5 per cent per annum for several centuries (for reasons which will be discussed below). The full range of possibilities allows us to describe a society where women averaged 5.5-7 live births yielding a birth rate of 42-50 per thousand, and where the expectation of life at birth was 20-30 years yielding a death rate of 38-50 per thousand and an infant mortality rate of 250-375 deaths per thousand live births. A medium assumption might be a situation where women averaged little more than six live births, where population growth averaged 0.33 per cent, where the expectation of life at birth was about 22.5 years (about the level of Rome at the end of the Republic)$^{20}$ and where the crude birth rate was about 48 per thousand, the crude death rate 45 per thousand and the infant mortality rate 300-350 per thousand.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered.

Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.584, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'Population redistribution and urbanization', 'content': 'three-quarters to less than three-fifths, Southern Africa had risen from one-fifteenth to a sixth, and tropical Africa from one-fifth to a quarter (while within tropical Africa, the fraction outside Nigeria had climbed from a quarter to a third).', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.53, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 272, 'article_title': 'BRASS RIVER', 'full_section_title': 'BRASS RIVER', 'last_edit_date': '11-03-1863', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1863#article-9', 'issue_date': '23_12_1863', 'content': 'Trade, after having been stopped here for four months, was resumed on the 23rd of October, with every prospect of its being henceforth carried on beneficially for all parties.

As to lunches, if taken at all, they are far from being ""heavy""—unless on festive occasions; to drink champagne is the exception, and as it and Moselle are the most useful wines for the tropics, it is a pity that most people on the Coast cannot afford to use them more freely, especially during the rainy season, or on recovery from sickness.

As regards suppers, I have rarely seen them in any part of Africa I have visited, both East and West Coasts; I have not seen twelve supper parties in as many years, unless on board of some outward-bound mail steamer, among the newcomers and the officers of the steamer; men who go to bed at 10 to 11 P.M., after a comfortable dinner, could not take supper.\n\nAs to the use of spirits, that varies greatly. I have always found the consumption largest where the district was most swampy, and thus most unhealthy. As a general rule, after one leaves the Coast, say fifty miles, and gets to higher ground and purer air, if there is no endemic cause for ill-health, the taste for spirits grows less, and often disappears. In travelling up the Gambia I seldom use spirits. Now I dislike the taste. Years ago, when living in a branch of the Niger Delta, for three years I used only claret, and sometimes ale. I had no relish for spirits. In Bathurst, almost every Englishman has to use brandy or whisky; they feel the want of it; the climate requires it. In some places, in the rainy season, men have to drink bottled stout at breakfast; they enjoy it, and it benefits their health, on account of the waste from perspiration at that season. But once a man does not relish it, it is a sign to give it up. With most ""old hands"" who drink claret at meals, when the claret loses its relish, the man knows he is going to be sick, and begins to take precautions.\n\nWere the swamp at the back of Bathurst filled up, the air being made purer, the consumption of stimulants would be largely decreased; but the Government say it would cost 50,000£, and that is too large a sum to expend for the improvement of health and the saving of life from malarious diseases.'}, {'id': 6007, 'article_title': 'Rum Drinking in Africa', 'full_section_title': 'Rum Drinking in Africa', 'last_edit_date': '09-01-1890', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-11', 'issue_date': '01_09_1890', 'content': 'and that we shall find new markets for the good of our English merchants.

That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics. In Brazil, no doubt, some Europeans drink themselves to death, but they are few; the majority, being of a better class, prefer to live well and to enjoy themselves rationally, without making beasts of themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.628, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Rum and Gin on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We extract the following from the *African Repository*, as written by the Rev.

And the traders, with one exception, are as remorseless as the grave.

There is perfect recklessness in those who come here; no thought for anything except for the greatest gain in the two or three years they are to remain. And how many of them, when counting the few days to their departure, and seeing home and all its joys so near, were cut down in a day! Death laid his hand on them, and visions of home became dark as Erebus. And there was no miracle and no special providence in this. It was only rendering to every man according to his deeds. And if rum has killed a fourth or a third of this people since we came here, it has killed quite as large a proportion of the traders who have sold the poison. Where the foot of the white man has never trod, the fiery stream of alcohol rolls and burns, causing waste and anguish and horrors greater than the middle passage ever witnessed. Some people wonder why the Coast tribes of Africa waste away and disappear. It is no wonder to one who has lived here with his eyes open, unless he himself has come within the maelstrom. The Coast is beleaguered with the hosts of Satan; and they are bold, persistent, untiring, unscrupulous, and unmerciful. If you wish to know some of the concomitants of the rum trade and rum-drinking, read Proverbs xxiii. 33. These are our real obstacles. Heathenism is bad, but unmixed it is not impregnable.

It is gratifying to find that the Council of the Royal Niger Company, than whom few are more interested in the commercial development of West and Central Africa, or have greater knowledge of how far the native's legitimate demand for alcoholic stimulants can safely be gratified, are doing all they can to minimize this mischief in the territories under their authority. More than a year ago the Council prohibited the importation of spirituous liquors into certain regions forming about one-third of their domain, and made a further regulation imposing penalties on the payment of wages in spirits throughout the whole of these territories. In following this course they have, without doubt, acted in the interests of the permanent success of the Company's operations in Africa.

In 1892 the importation of rum amounted to 1,029,114 gallons, of the value of £75,629; gin and geneva, 220,322 gallons, of the value of £18,185; whiskey, 5,054 gallons, valued at £2,244; brandy, 485 gallons, valued at £401; wines, 20,492 gallons, valued at £6,085; ale and porter, 19,665 gallons, valued at £2,256. Commenting on these figures, the Colonial Secretary, Mr. F. M. Hodson, points out that with an estimated population of 1,473,882 this gives an average consumption of nearly a gallon a head; but there is no doubt that a large quantity of the spirits imported into the colony finds its way into Ashanti and other interior countries not within the protectorate, and that three-quarters of a gallon per head more nearly approximates to accuracy. In the United Kingdom, with its population of 38,000,000, the annual consumption of spirits is roughly 39,000,000 gallons, and of beer 31,000,000 barrels, besides other strong drinks. It is clear, therefore, he says, that the consumption of alcoholic drinks on the Gold Coast compares very favourably with that of the United Kingdom.

A young engineer, hot and tired from his day\'s work, drank at dinner a large quantity of Portuguese wine. A severe attack of dysentery followed, and when convalescent, though still weak, he was sent to the coast on his way home, with the most solemn warnings not to touch strong drinks. Yet, while waiting for the steamer, he sold his coat for a bottle of gin, and twelve hours later he was in his grave. Another engineer somehow obtained possession of a bottle of brandy at lunch, and was shortly afterwards found dead with the bottle under his head.

""It will give new life to the State, and introduce civilization into the heart of Africa very rapidly indeed. At present there are some thousands of native traders at Stanley Pool, and there are European traders at the head of the navigation of the Lower Congo, so close to the cataracts that they can hear their roar; yet the two cannot come together on account of these cataracts, which form a gap 235 miles long. This gap can only be bridged by the native carriers, who are all absorbed in the transport of some 1,200 tons of merchandise in the year. While this state of things lasts progress is impossible. These 1,200 tons now being transported on the heads and backs of the carriers would be a mere drop in the ocean, compared with the goodly trade that would be going up the Congo if the native traders could be supplied with a sufficient quantity of goods.""\n\n""This, then, is probably one reason of the excessive dearness of ivory, which threatens soon to become worth nearly its weight in gold?""\n\n""It is the only reason. Ivory has almost disappeared from all the accessible areas of Africa; but the areas at present inaccessible are so vast that there is abundance of ivory, and also of rubber. The native traders are willing and eager to search for these precious articles; but if they all rushed up the affluents of the Congo to fetch goods, they might be years in getting rid of them. Thus you may see how great an impetus commerce will receive from the construction of the railway. As soon as the natives have gathered all the ivory from their own resorts, they will be urged by the demand for more to proceed still further into the interior, taking with them the worth of their goods in the produce of English industry.""\n\n""Then you think, Mr. Stanley, that one of the earliest results to be expected from the railway would be the cheapening of ivory?""', 'last_edit_date': '1886-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1886#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.576, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Drink Traffic on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the meeting of the Manchester, Salford and District Temperance Union, held on Feb. 26, Mr. T. C. Rayner, District Commissioner of the Gold Coast Colony, read a paper on ""The Drink Traffic in West Africa."" He said that most of those who had interested themselves in this question had stated that wholesale demoralisation and degradation of native races had followed the introduction of the liquor traffic among them. West Africa had been singled out as a bad example of what was going on. He had recently returned from a year\'s residence on part of that coast, and his official position had given him every opportunity of inquiring into this matter. The conclusion to which he had been led was somewhat opposed to that commonly received, and certainly differed from the preconceived opinion he had formed before he went out. His experience had led him to think that the evils of the liquor traffic had been exaggerated, and that there was nothing like the wholesale demoralisation of native races going on of which we were accustomed to hear. At the same time it was undoubtedly true that a vast amount of alcoholic liquor was being imported, and a very lucrative trade was being done by the European and native merchants in the coast towns. The sale of intoxicating liquors was practically unrestricted on the Gold Coast. A small duty was charged upon all imported into the colony, and formed the chief part of the colonial revenue. The cost of government was borne chiefly by the liquor traffic. Extreme temperance friends would be inclined to hold up their hands in pious horror at such an arrangement, but it was only fair to remember that it had much to recommend it even from their standpoint, as a Customs tariff discouraged the importation of such dangerous articles as spirits and gunpowder by saddling them with the payment of duties. As to the effect of the liquor traffic upon the natives, he said that even among the lowest and most degraded of African savages it was impossible to find such wretchedness and vice as ten minutes\' walk from the room in which they were assembled would take them to. He had also been unable on the Gold Coast to trace any close connexion between drink and crime, and on this point he claimed to speak with some authority. And as to the physical deterioration of native races through drink, he thought those who had seen much of the African at home would agree with him that as yet he showed no sign of this. At the same time he was far from saying that the drink traffic was doing no harm. Happily it had not yet wrought the mischief in Africa which it had at home, but the trade was increasing, and it was impossible to say what evil it might do in the future if it were allowed to go on unchecked. To prohibit the traffic would be simply to ruin the British colonies without doing any good, for in such a case the trade would be diverted to the French or German settlements in close contiguity to our own. And, as had been pointed out, it was better to retain the traffic in our own hands, so as to be able to regulate it. His own view was that at present they must work in Africa as they had had to do in England, by moral suasion. This work had already been begun, and, he was glad to say, was progressing satisfactorily.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-03-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_03_1889#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.587, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE CLIMATE OF THE GOLD COAST', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following is taken from an article from the pen of Dr. J. A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2. Avoid getting chilled by standing or sitting for any length of time when the body is unduly heated, or by neglecting to change underclothing as soon as possible after profuse sweating.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1887#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.613, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of West Africa—Gold Mining—The Labour Question', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Now, first, as regards the climate and mode of living. With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.597, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In the Government Blue-book relative to the comparative health, &c., of seamen employed on various stations throughout the world there is the following relative to the climate of the West Coast, by Assistant-Surgeon J.

On shore, from the little I have seen of it, Englishmen act very much as if they were at home, and indeed sometimes much more loosely; they smoke and imbibe alcoholic stimulants too much, and indulge especially in other forms of dissipation, which are all debilitating causes, preparing the way for the inroads of malaria.

With temperance in diet, stimulants, and, generally, personal cleanliness as well as surrounding cleanliness, a free interchange of air in dormitories, exercise in the open air, and a moderate exposure to the sun, I think Europeans, fully grown and with sound constitutions, could remain many years on the Coast, and return to Europe without much impairment of health. This would be very much more true could merchants choose their trading stations. For obvious reasons at present the mouths of the rivers are chosen, which above all are the most unhealthy places, especially as in many cases pure water cannot be had, and river water, often impure, is used for all purposes. Afloat, with little communication with the shore, no general leave at notoriously unhealthy places, using distilled water, or good spring water when it can be had without exposing the men to too much fatigue or malaria, avoiding river waters, and rarely entering them; a free use of quinine when required; doing away with boat cruising, more berthing accommodation, a liberal supply of fresh beef and vegetables, allowing the men to buy stock at the various places, less drill aloft, great attention to personal cleanliness and the general cleanliness of the ship, I feel sure, putting aside the so-called infectious epidemics, which ought rarely to occur, the health of the cruisers would be as good as on any station, and better than on many.""', 'last_edit_date': '1869-04-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1869#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.585, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'HOW TO DECREASE MORTALITY IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'What the French have done during the last years in Algeria is, indeed, most remarkable, and the lesson to be learnt from it is, that the work of reducing a death-rate from eighty in the 1,000 to fourteen in the 1,000, though not a slight one, is not an impossibility.

To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease. Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

Smallpox vaccination was on such a small scale that by the late 1930s a significant reduction of the disease had probably taken place only in the Gold Coast and southern Nigeria. 93 In contrast, contact with Europeans and participation in the First World War ensured that the influenza epidemic of 1918-19 swept through Africa probably resulting in the highest annual death rate this century, although the rise in death rates was probably not as great as in Asia, for many African populations were still protected by comparative isolation. Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.751, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.71, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A basis for the future', 'content': 'By 1935 Africa had successfully withstood the demographic shock of European colonization.

By about 1935, the population was undoubtedly grow› ing because of increasing control over mortality, and the basis was laid for a doubling over the next third of a century which almost certainly hastened and consolidated independence.\nMany indices can be used to illustrate the changes between the two dates, and some help to explain the demographic transition. In 1880 a European presence inland from the coast was largely restricted to Algeria, where a third of a million migrants, mainly from France, Spain, Italy and Malta, had consolidated the victory of the French army, and South Africa, where a similar number of Europeans, predominantly of Dutch and English extraction, now had a vanguard as far north as the Limpopo river. (See Fig. i.i.) Elsewhere Europeans were beginning to exert control over Egypt and Tunisia, ruled some coastal populations in Senegal and the Gold Coast (now Ghana) and held such enclaves as The Gambia, Sierra Leone, Lagos, Libreville and parts of Angola and Mozambique. By 1935 European administations controlled almost the entire continent (see Fig. 12.2). The half century saw European medical science progressing from an ignorance of the cause of most of Africa's major diseases to an ability to contain or cure most of them; indeed the period ends just as the sulpha drugs were ushering in an era of chemotherapy of great significance for the continent.

As A. G. Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A fragile population emerging from near stability', 'content': 'This picture is not in any way surprising.

One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent.

Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

The first important beneficial social effect was the overall increase of the population of Africa during the colonial period by about 37.5%, as J. C. Caldwell has shown (Chapter 18), after its decline during the first two or three decades of colonialism. This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization. As A. E. Afigbo has emphasized (Chapter 19), urban› ization was of course not unknown in pre-colonial Africa. The kingdoms and empires of Africa had such capitals or political centres as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, Gao and Great Zimbabwe; such commercial centres as Kano, Jenne, Sofala and Malindi, and such educational centres as Timbuktu, Cairo and Fez. But there is no doubt that as a result of colonial› ism, the pace of urbanization was greatly accelerated.

Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi. It was not until after the Second World War that technical schools and univer› sity colleges were established in most parts of Africa. And significantly, only one university college each was established in the Gold Coast in 1947, in Nigeria in 1948, in Uganda in 1950, in Senegal and Madagascar in 1950, in Salisbury in 1953, in Congo Leopoldville in 1954 and Elizabethville in 1956.

It is more difficult, but perhaps not impossible, to imagine that the level of disease (venereal disease and other infections) generated during this period still resulted in a high level of female sterility half a century or more afterwards. It is also difficult to feel that the situation in this region is adequately covered by a recent United Nations' publication writing of'cultural shock' and 'the processes of adjustment'. 71 Eventually the colonial penetration was to lead to a great increase in population.

In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans.

We do not, for instance, pretend that the West African climate is not unhealthy. We admit that it is. But we as fearlessly contend that it is not one whit more unhealthy for Europeans than many of the West India Islands, or than Hong Kong, China, or India, &c. These regions are equally liable to visitations of epidemic disease as is West Africa, in the shape of yellow fever, dysentery, &c. We are, moreover, firmly convinced that if ever the day arrives when complete, and not mere partial statistical tables, are compiled, showing the mortality amongst Europeans at the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and even the new settlement at Lagos, the facts fairly and impartially revealed will demonstrate that at least a moiety of the deaths which occur amongst them are not the result of climatic disease, but are chargeable occasionally to accident; more frequently to a lamentable and wanton neglect of ordinary care and precautions; and too often to reckless indulgences, which will in any climate sap the springs of life, and ultimately destroy it. As additional evidences in support of these statements, take, for example, the records with regard to the numerous governors who have served, or are now serving, in West Africa. We find that in most instances they were and are men who had passed middle life before being called upon to administer those Governments, and were consequently far less able to bear up against attacks of fever. Yet, of the thirty-four gentlemen who have governed Sierra Leone from 1792 to 1864, seven only died there in that long period of seventy-two years. Of those seven, one was killed in action, another veteran most unwisely made fruit and vegetables his sole diet; and one of them had previously lived upwards of thirty-five years in the colony, dying at sea, not of disease incident to the climate, but of cancer of the stomach. At the Gambia, none of the governors have died since 1837, when\n[January 23, 1864.]', 'last_edit_date': '1864-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1864#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.73, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—I read the paragraph in your paper of this month under the above title, and can add my testimony to the value of “Lamplough’s Pyretic Saline,” if not as a sure preventive, certainly as a deterrent and palliative in African fevers.\n\nIn your remarks, however, I find no mention made of the probable causes of such mortality, which I think is necessary when speaking of the effects of a climate like West Africa, the bad reputation of which is so very much exaggerated. Nor do you make any distinction between the colonies, classing Sierra Leone with Lagos, Gambia, and Cape Coast, which I am sure the facts would not warrant.\n\nTo revert, however, to the causes of mortality on the West Coast of Africa, I am of opinion that there are many influential causes conducing to the same which might be prevented, and I take the liberty of intruding on your valuable space to enumerate one or two of them.\n\n1. The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics. In Brazil, no doubt, some Europeans drink themselves to death, but they are few; the majority, being of a better class, prefer to live well and to enjoy themselves rationally, without making beasts of themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.759, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EPIDEMIC ON THE AFRICAN COAST', 'section_title': '', 'content': '### EPIDEMIC ON THE AFRICAN COAST.\n\n**February 11.**—Information has been received in Liverpool this morning of a serious outbreak of small-pox at Bathurst, British Gambia, and also that quarantine restrictions are again in force at Goree, Senegal.

A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2. Avoid getting chilled by standing or sitting for any length of time when the body is unduly heated, or by neglecting to change underclothing as soon as possible after profuse sweating.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1887#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.731, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE AFRICAN CLIMATE', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Since that time Fernando Po has changed its deadly nature, as the coming chocolate and coffee planters will find.

Yes, here is new evidence of the fact, that the denunciations hurled by the families of victims, and by journalists ignorant in these matters, upon the climate of certain portions of the globe under British rule or power, in which British soldiers, sailors, and civilians have to serve, ought rather to be heaped on the authorities who so unnecessarily and wantonly sacrifice the lives of their fellow-subjects and fellow-servants.

It is therefore important to find such mischievous exaggerations combated by a medical officer, who writes of West Africa, not from hearsay evidence, but from the experience derived during a residence of twenty-three years in the colony of Sierra Leone and settlements of the Gold Coast. We make these remarks by way of introducing to more general notice the papers above noted, because they supply much valuable and novel information, not only regarding the diseases to which Europeans and natives are subject in West Africa, but because they furnish an interesting description of the topography of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.\n\nMr. Clarke is of opinion that the climate of West Africa, if fairly tested, can stand comparison in point of healthfulness with most of our colonies in the East or West Indies, where endemic and epidemic fevers, dysentery, with cholera to boot, prevail quite as frequently and fatally. There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years. Comparatively, their number is not small, comprehending persons of all classes—governors, civil and military officers, merchants, and missionaries, with their wives and families. He states ""that formerly many officers in the English, Dutch, and Danish service resided upon the Gold Coast, some fourteen, twenty, and thirty years,* and enjoyed good health, although those in subordinate positions had to remove from one station to another."" The fact ought no longer to be concealed, that half at least of the deaths and incapacities which occur amongst Europeans arise from errors of personal economy, and that the mortality lists are unfairly swelled by ascribing to the climate deaths which have been caused by accident or intemperance.\n\nThe following passages may be adduced as proof that the climate is not to blame for everything:—', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.771, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of West Africa—Gold Mining—The Labour Question', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Now, first, as regards the climate and mode of living. With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.725, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dreadful Ravages of Cholera at Zanzibar, East Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dr. Kirk, in a letter from Zanzibar, dated February 7, 1870, says: ""There died here in this town alone upwards of 10,000 in one month and a half, and 30,000 in the whole island; now it rages up and down the coast.

The General History of Africa highlights that Europeans were more susceptible to indigenous diseases, including yellow fever, as evidenced by higher death rates among European soldiers compared to African soldiers in British West African forces. This suggests some level of immunity or resilience among native Africans to certain tropical diseases. However, the text does not explicitly link this natural immunity to the necessity of employing African medical professionals. Instead, it focuses on the establishment of tropical medical schools in Europe and the presence of medical missionaries, including some Africans, with an emphasis on saving European lives. In contrast, The African Times articles strongly support the claim, emphasizing that native Africans' immunity to yellow fever underscored the necessity of employing African medical professionals. The articles argue that this immunity provided a compelling reason to employ African surgeons and physicians, ensuring continuous medical assistance during epidemics and offering economic benefits by reducing the need for European medical staff. The African Times also counters any doubts about the competence of African medical professionals, citing successful examples in various roles. Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view, with the textbook offering historical context and the articles advocating for the practical and economic advantages of employing African medical professionals in response to yellow fever.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details related to the claim about the natural immunity of native Africans to yellow fever and the employment of African medical professionals.

Furthermore, the articles mention the economic benefits of employing African medical professionals, as it would reduce the expenses associated with transporting European medical officers. The African Times also refutes the notion that Europeans or Africans lack confidence in African medical professionals, citing examples of successful African individuals in various professional roles. Overall, the articles align closely with the claim, providing both medical and economic justifications for the employment of African medical professionals in West Africa.",True,879,Health and Disease,Health and Disease Hardships for European Explorers,"[{'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm, Ascaris infections, schistosomiasis, filariasis and Guinea worm. To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease. Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively. Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s. Nevertheless, tropical medical schools were established in Europe as early as 1897 in Liverpool and London, 1900 in Hamburg, 1901 in Brussels, followed later by Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles, and in Africa by 1912 in Cape Town and 1918 in Dakar."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.735, 'probability_score': 0.054, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""In tropical Africa governmental medicine was long a military concern although small civilian hospitals began to appear in the 1890s. From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered. Yellow fever epidemics have occurred from Senegal to Sudan at unpredictable intervals. By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""Much of this labour movement in the third of a century after 1880 was accompanied by appallingly high mortality.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...''

In 1880 a European presence inland from the coast was largely restricted to Algeria, where a third of a million migrants, mainly from France, Spain, Italy and Malta, had consolidated the victory of the French army, and South Africa, where a similar number of Europeans, predominantly of Dutch and English extraction, now had a vanguard as far north as the Limpopo river.

Commerce was one, although whether such activities brought prosperity and the ability to buy food in times of need and perhaps some health care in the few places where it existed to a greater degree than it brought disease arising from increased contact with strangers is debatable. By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent. There were two reasons for the trade: firstly that alcohol could be produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits; secondly, in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, there were real problems about what goods would be accepted in return for the produce of Africa.$^{43}$ Mary Kingsley found the trade spirit pure and likely to do less harm than cannabis,$^{44}$ a view shared by a committee that investigated the liquor trade in içoç.$^{45}$ Spirits were distributed on a huge scale, frequently as wages.

Even as it was, the white population of the continent had increased thirty times from 25000 in 1800, found mostly in the Cape, to three-quarters of a million in 1880, of whom five-sixths were in South Africa, Algeria and Egypt.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths. From 50 to 80 per cent have or have had syphilis or yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm,"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': ""Famines and psychological stress also left the uprooted and malnourished vulnerable to infectious diseases carried by the coastal traders. Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

Given the stability of the population in North Africa, and the intensive agriculture and irrigation in the fertile areas and oases, there was a steady increase of population in periods of prosperity, but this seems to have been balanced by periods of drought and plague, and the population barely remained stable. In the grasslands of the Sudanic zone of West Africa, Central and Southern Africa, the populations were constantly adapting their techniques and achieving a symbiosis between pastoralists and agriculturists, or developing systems of mixed agriculture capable of sustaining a rising population. Similarly, in the more forested areas, systems of agriculture were developed which sustained increases in the population, and by the eighteenth century high densities were achieved in some areas such as the Lower Casamance, the Igbo country in south-eastern Nigeria, the Cameroon grasslands and the Great Lakes region of East Africa.\nHowever, in addition to the occasional natural disasters, the loss of population through the slave trade and the devastating wars associated with it, especially the loss of women of childbearing age over such a long period, was such that the overall population of Africa declined in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, though the loss was unevenly distributed, falling most harshly on those less able to defend themselves, and being con› centrated in that period in West and West-Central Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.634, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'The causes of failure', 'content': ""Every case of resistance and armed insurrection went down to defeat, at least if one considers only the results at the scene of action.

Moreover, the West African states never succeeded in setting up an organic alliance that would compel their enemies to do battle simultaneously on several fronts. Certain states clearly perceived the necessity for this, but their attempts to bring it about came to naught. Most of the resisters resorted to guerrilla warfare too late, when they had learned through defeat that neither conventional warfare nor the defensive systems of the 'tatas' left them any chance of success in the face of enemies possessing weapons capable of greater destruction. To all that must be added the fact, already pointed out above, that in 1890 the imperialists, by the Brussels Convention, reached an agreement that no further arms should be sold to Africans. Thereafter, the Africans encountered severe logistic problems.

destructive epidemic is sweeping off the Europeans on the West Coast of Africa, has long been viewed by this Society as worthy of particular regard in questions of British Administration in Her Majesty's colonies, forts, and settlements on that Coast.\n\nIt seems particularly desirable that when an epidemic of so virulent and fatal a nature is raging, there should be no lack of medical assistance, as there unfortunately has often been in consequence of the deaths of European surgeons from yellow fever.\n\nIt having been fully established that native Africans are capable, if properly educated, of attaining such a degree of efficiency in surgery and medicine as entitles them to, and secures for them, the confidence and respect, not only of educated people of colour, but of eminent Europeans on the West Coast, the Society take the liberty of expressing their opinion that there can be no doubt as to the advisability and necessity of an adequate supply of properly qualified native African surgeons and physicians for service on the West Coast, by which the certainty of medical attendance for the sick at periods of violent epidemics, as well as at all other times, will be secured.\n\nThe Society having in view the many loathsome and destructive maladies which assist in depopulating Africa, and increasing the misery of its people, cannot avoid the further expression of their opinion that it is the duty of this Christian country, on the ground of common humanity alone, if on no other, to endeavour to qualify many natives of Africa in medicine and surgery, to supply the means of mitigating and removing much of that misery.\n\nMajesty's Government that a medical school for the educated natives of various parts of Africa should be established by Her Majesty's Government at Sierra Leone, in a great degree, if not entirely, under the direction and superintendence of competent medical men—natives of Africa—who have passed with success through the medical schools in Great Britain, and have since given proofs of efficiency in Her Majesty's service in Africa.\n\nThe Society has the honour to solicit for that suggestion the full and impartial consideration which Her Majesty's Government must naturally be disposed to give to a matter connected with an economy of valuable European life in Africa—an ultimate economy of money in the medical department of Her Majesty's service in Africa—and an effective application of the inestimable benefits of medical and surgical skill among the suffering multitudes of Africa, who are known to

We believe that there would be no difficulty whatever in finding educated men of colour who would gladly accept these appointments. We therefore again strenuously advocate their being employed, not only because such a step would save the country the large sum of money which at present is annually expended in providing European medical officers with passages to and from the Coast, but because of its paramount importance in the saving of human life.

We desire not to be misunderstood, or as advocating that the army and colonial medical officers on this Coast should consist only of negro surgeons; all we contend for is, that medical men of that race ought to be exclusively stationed in localities notoriously known to be at present most dangerous to European health and life: and partially in every other colony or dependency on the West African Coast.

We shall not, however, waste words upon the subject, but simply state that the capabilities of the negro race may be inferred by their holding at Sierra Leone the appointments of Chief Justice, Colonial Secretary, Registrar of Mixed Commission Court, Marshal to the Vice-Admiralty Court, Collector of Customs, Sheriff and Crown Record Office; the Counsel at the Sierra Leone Bar being also coloured gentlemen; by Mr. Ingram's recent appointment as Queen's Advocate at the Gambia; and nearly by all the clerks in the Government and merchants' offices being black or coloured persons. Besides, we are also aware that by far the most talented, influential, and wealthy merchant now upon that coast is of African descent. Moreover, we likewise know, from the best authority, that the Rev. Mr. Robin, Acting Colonial Chaplain (one of the many ordained black clergymen on the Coast—a pure-blooded negro), received from the Governors of the Gold Coast and Gambia the highest commendations, his conduct being brought by them under the favourable notice of Her Majesty's Government. Further, none more strongly urged the appointment of black surgeons than the late Bishop Bowen did, and surely it may be conceded that he was a competent judge of their fitness.*"", 'last_edit_date': '1863-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1863#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.73, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We are aware that medical officers now greatly prefer serving in West Africa to the West Indies, and for obvious reasons. For not only is the time of service on that coast doubly reckoned, but they enjoy besides the substantial advantage of private practice. This advantage they do not enjoy in the West Indies, private practice being in the hands of the civil medical practitioners. That the emoluments from this source are considerable, may be judged of by the fact that the late colonial surgeon of Sierra Leone is understood to have realised the handsome sum of 20,000l., and the yearly income of the present colonial surgeon of that colony from official and private practice is, as has been stated by himself and friends, 1,200l. or 1,500l. per annum. We are glad, therefore, to know that some of the native gentlemen are educating their sons to the medical profession. A beginning has been made in this direction, Messrs. Smith and Spilsberry being far advanced medical students at King's College, and the appointment to staff-assistant-surgeoncies of Drs. Davis and Horton is a proof that the Government is alive to the advantages of having coloured medical officers attached to the regiments stationed in West Africa. Strangely, however, their appointment is viewed almost as an intrusion by some of their European professional brethren on the coast, and we have heard it rumoured that one of these medical gentlemen had it even in contemplation to resign his commission rather than subject himself to the passive, but not less harassing annoyances to which he had been subjected. Be that as it may, it is of importance that every encouragement should be held out by the Government to native gentlemen who have qualified themselves to hold appointments either in the army or colonial medical service in West Africa. We are aware that against the appointment of native medical gentlemen the argument is constantly advanced, that neither Europeans nor Africans have confidence in them. This assertion we emphatically deny, and beg to record our protest against it. And if evidence were wanting of its utter groundlessness, we could, in support of our statement, triumphantly point to the late Staff Surgeon William Fergusson, a dark mulatto gentleman (afterwards Governor of Sierra Leone), in whose medical skill both Europeans and natives had unbounded confidence. To assert, therefore, that the advice of native medical officers would not be esteemed, is the flimsiest of pretences. From all we have learnt, we suspect that the true reason of the opposition offered by European medical officers on this head may be traced to their natural apprehension that the lucrative field of private practice, now in the hands of a few, would be greatly diminished when black or coloured medical gentlemen come to contest it with them."", 'last_edit_date': '1863-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1863#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.73, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Yellow Fever', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It is with deep sorrow we have recorded the death by yellow fever of seven Europeans at Bathurst, River Gambia. Seven deaths, in the course we believe of three or four days, out of a European population of at most some thirty or forty! There is this fever peculiarity on the West Coast of Africa, that whenever the common fevers are very virulent among the natives, yellow fever attacks Europeans. And this type of disease seems unhappily to have lost none of its fatal power in that part of the world. The _Times_ has lately indulged in a furious sanitary leader against the West Coast, and inserted numerous letters _apropos_ of the mortality by yellow fever on board Her Majesty’s ship Bristol.* A great amount of nonsense has in this case been mixed up with the unhappy truth of nearly thirty deaths in the course of a few months among the officers and crew of that ill-fated vessel. If the loud denouncers of service on the African Coast, because of these deaths, had consulted the statistics of the Navy for some years past, they would have found that the mortality has been by no means the greatest on the West Coast of Africa—that there are other naval stations on which the death-rate is higher. We do not, however, hear it proposed that those stations should therefore be given up; it is only as regards the West Coast of Africa that such abandonment of national duty is urged. It is unhappily fashionable at the present time to attack Africa and the Africans. A leading article of the _Daily Telegraph_, on occasion of the bestowal of a knighthood on Sir Edward Baker, lately returned from the sources of the Nile, might be adduced as additional evidence of this fact. We do not deny the stated disgusting and horrible barbarism and cruel superstition of the mass of the native Africans, whether on the coast or in the interior; we do not deny that there are diseases prevalent there which make the countries so dangerous to Europeans as to exact from them, if they have any regard for their lives, extreme care and prudence, and recourse to the best means of prevention and cure. But we do say that the deeper, the more intense, the more disgusting and horrifying the barbarism and superstition may be, the greater the duty of Christian England to endeavour by the diffusion of Christian truth to mitigate those horrors; and we do also affirm, that the African diseases, including the occasional yellow fever, have not necessarily that fatal character which is attributed to them. The mortality on board the Bristol, if not owing (as in some previously notorious cases) to an abominable source of infection in the ship itself, must have had some recognisable cause or causes. A rigid inquiry seems to us to be necessary, not only as to the original outbreak of the fever among the crew, but as to the means of prevention and cure adopted. If we are not misinformed, it would be found that the mortality has been chiefly among men who were most injudiciously and improperly exposed to excessive labour under a tropical sun, immediately after their arrival from England, and while yellow fever was known to be about. No such case of mortality as this of the crew of the Bristol ought to remain uninquired into. It is easy to cover fatal and most condemnable errors by a denunciation of climate. We should like, alas! to know what was the course of medical treatment adopted on board the Bristol, and what among those who have died at Bathurst? Yellow fever, like cholera, is one of those malignant forms of disease that do not admit of being trifled with. The old system of treatment of yellow fever was one under which to be attacked was almost to have the death-warrant signed for the unhappy sufferer; and a persistence at the present day in such system gives necessarily pretty similar results. But if under that system so few recoveries take place, why are there not imperative orders from the Admiralty and the Colonial Offices, that in all outbreaks of the yellow fever, the _saline treatment_, recommended by Dr. Stevens, under which almost all yellow fever patients are said to have recovered in the West Indies—why, we say, are there not imperative orders that his system should be tried? These are not the days in which the lives of our officers and sailors and Government _employés_ ought to be allowed to be trifled with. Every discovery of modern science ought to be at their command for their use and service, or science may, so far as they are concerned, shut up shop at once. We insist upon this point.

But we have been subject to such misrepresentations when combating stereotyped misstatements as regards West Africa, that we will not allow any one to misunderstand us. The opinions we put forward with regard to the climate of West Africa have not been hastily or crudely formed, nor have they been adopted to serve some temporary or interested purpose. They are the result of evidence that cannot be disproved. They are promulgated by us to remove prejudices which war against our efforts for the advancement of civilization in Africa, and because we feel that they are pregnant with most practical results. We do not, for instance, pretend that the West African climate is not unhealthy. We admit that it is. But we as fearlessly contend that it is not one whit more unhealthy for Europeans than many of the West India Islands, or than Hong Kong, China, or India, &c. These regions are equally liable to visitations of epidemic disease as is West Africa, in the shape of yellow fever, dysentery, &c. We are, moreover, firmly convinced that if ever the day arrives when complete, and not mere partial statistical tables, are compiled, showing the mortality amongst Europeans at the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and even the new settlement at Lagos, the facts fairly and impartially revealed will demonstrate that at least a moiety of the deaths which occur amongst them are not the result of climatic disease, but are chargeable occasionally to accident; more frequently to a lamentable and wanton neglect of ordinary care and precautions; and too often to reckless indulgences, which will in any climate sap the springs of life, and ultimately destroy it. As additional evidences in support of these statements, take, for example, the records with regard to the numerous governors who have served, or are now serving, in West Africa.

Of those seven, one was killed in action, another veteran most unwisely made fruit and vegetables his sole diet; and one of them had previously lived upwards of thirty-five years in the colony, dying at sea, not of disease incident to the climate, but of cancer of the stomach.

We have given quotations from the advices daily received in England. It is not alone in the United States, however, that we hear of its ravages. The French Government having received an official report of its serious outbreak at Senegal, despatched immediately a medical reinforcement of six doctors, with adequate supplies of all kinds, to meet the dread emergency. The ravages committed by this malady during its former visits to the West Coast of Africa, when so large a proportion of the Europeans in some of the settlements fell victims to it; and the fearful outbreak of small-pox, of a peculiarly virulent character, among the natives, which attended it in its progress, were so painfully fresh in our memory, that we lost not a moment in calling the attention of Her Majesty\'s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies to the news received, and the measures adopted by the French Government; and soliciting that additional medical aid, with abundant supplies of vaccine lymph, should be also despatched by Her Majesty\'s Government to the West Coast settlements. We have since received an assurance from the Colonial Office that some immediate measures would be taken. We cannot, however, conceal our deep anxiety as regards that dreaded visitant. When it last made its appearance at Bathurst, it carried off its victims with extreme rapidity; and its subsequent progress southward was of an equally distressing character; while the records in our Journal of the heart-rending scenes witnessed by Dr. Horton when on his vaccination tour through the Anamaboe district, attest how deeply the native population must be interested in the matter. Our fear is, that with the cessation of the rains, the Yellow Fever will travel southward from Senegal, and that ere long we shall have to depore its outbreak at Bathurst and Sierra Leone. We do not wish to spread alarm, but we do wish that the imminence of the peril may impel the Colonial authorities to adopt and enforce without delay all possible sanitary precautions. The accounts we have lately received of flagrant inattention as regards this important matter by the authorities at Bathurst and Sierra Leone, who are supposed to be charged with the responsibility of attending to it, are of a nature to deepen our alarm when we hear of Yellow Fever in the neighbourhood. All ordinary reasoning would have justified us in believing that when Her Majesty\'s Government adopted for Bathurst and Sierra Leone the most unusual, if not unprecedented, course of entrusting the local administration to gentlemen of the Army Medical Department, they had at least done what would insure that due attention would be given to sanitary measures. How are we to account for the result not having justified our belief? It cannot be that there were supreme orders that ""no money should be spent"" on what is so vital not only to the prosperity, but to the continued existence of British settlements on the West Coast; and if it be not owing to this, we say it with all proper respect for authorities appointed by the Queen, it cannot be otherwise accounted for than that these authorities are totally unfitted for the responsible posts entrusted to them. Should the Yellow Fever, and the virulent small-pox, its ordinary accompaniment on the West Coast, visit the settlements, their ravages cannot fail to be aggravated by that neglect of sanitary precautions of which complaint is continually reaching us; and the authorities, who have neglected those precautions, although they may not be made criminally liable, as they will have deserved, will at least incur a moral responsibility which may well overwhelm them, if their long familiarity with human sufferings under various diseases shall not have destroyed all ordinary feelings of humanity within their bosoms. We hope these observations from our pen will reach these authorities before the fearful visitants make their appearance; and that all past neglect will be atoned for by an activity as ardent as their apathy has been torpid. We call on all the authorities down the Coast, from Bathurst to Lagos—on all the masters of trading hulks at Bonny, Benin, New and Old Calabar, and Cameroons, and the heads of all trading stations on the South-west Coast, to commence without delay all possible sanitary measures. The Spanish Governor of Fernando Po would act wisely in taking similar precautions. Should the dreaded malady not spread southward from Senegal—as we fervently hope, but cannot believe will be the case—nothing will have been lost by the activity and expense that may have been made and exhibited. Sanitary measures, if properly conceived and carried into execution, must always be productive of benefit to the general health in the absence of virulent epidemics, as well as being influential in arresting and mitigating the spread and intensity of these when they do make their appearance. Among the blessings of British rule ought most certainly to be included a comparative immunity from epidemical diseases, owing to the adoption and enforcement of sanitary regulations; and it is time that efforts be really made in the British settlements on the West Coast to remove the natural stimulating agents of disease, and by sanitary police regulations put an end to all that filthiness which is represented to us as making the atmosphere of many of the Coast towns repulsively sickening and almost unbearable. Lessons in cleanliness are lessons in civilization; and there can be no reason that we know of why Sierra Leone, Bathurst, Cape Coast, Accra, and Lagos should not be made at least as healthy as Calcutta, Madras, and', 'last_edit_date': '1878-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1878#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sanitariums for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'M\'Carthy\'s Island, River Gambia, Dec. 20, 1864.\n\nMy Lord,—In the editorial article in the Lancet of October 13, page 442, we find the remark that ""it is a singular fact in medical geography that from St. Louis, Senegal, on the north, to Mossamedes, on the south, there is not upon the seaboard a single healthy acre of ground. The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—I read the paragraph in your paper of this month under the above title, and can add my testimony to the value of “Lamplough’s Pyretic Saline,” if not as a sure preventive, certainly as a deterrent and palliative in African fevers.\n\nIn your remarks, however, I find no mention made of the probable causes of such mortality, which I think is necessary when speaking of the effects of a climate like West Africa, the bad reputation of which is so very much exaggerated. Nor do you make any distinction between the colonies, classing Sierra Leone with Lagos, Gambia, and Cape Coast, which I am sure the facts would not warrant.\n\nTo revert, however, to the causes of mortality on the West Coast of Africa, I am of opinion that there are many influential causes conducing to the same which might be prevented, and I take the liberty of intruding on your valuable space to enumerate one or two of them.\n\n1. The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics. In Brazil, no doubt, some Europeans drink themselves to death, but they are few; the majority, being of a better class, prefer to live well and to enjoy themselves rationally, without making beasts of themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.717, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE HOMŒOPATHIC TREATMENT OF MALARIAL FEVERS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dr. Hayward said he had given much attention to malaria and malarial fevers, which were of the same nature and required much the same treatment wherever they occurred, whether in Africa, India, or America. It was well known that the majority of European residents on the Coast sooner or later became attacked by African fever in one form or another, and even those who merely visited the coast ran risk of being attacked, especially if they were over forty years of age, or were in a low or depressed state. They were also aware that when in the malignant form—""black water fever""—under the present method of treatment the majority of those attacked died. This melancholy state of matters was almost daily brought home to them by the loss, if not of relations or friends, at least of officials, such as captains, managers, clerks, and others. It was not to be wondered at, therefore, that they should be dissatisfied with the present mode of treatment, and inquire if it was not possible for some improvement to be inaugurated in this respect. Of course the question arose—could the method of medical practice called homœopathic effect any better results? He unhesitatingly said it could, and he spoke after an experience of 35 years in homœopathic practice, preceded by 15 years\' experience in ordinary or allopathic practice. He based this assertion on the published results of the two methods of treatment in the most severe diseases and the worst forms of malignant malarial fever. Unfortunately there were not any practitioners on the coast sufficiently familiar with the resources of homœopathy to be able to demonstrate this on the spot, but it had been shown over and over again in the malignant malarial fevers of tropical and sub-tropical America and India, where similar fevers were much the same as in the regions of Africa; and there the mortality under homœopathic treatment was not one-third that under ordinary treatment. When the mortality in yellow fever under ordinary treatment was about 70 per cent of those attacked, that under homœopathic treatment was about 20 per cent, and in mild epidemics less than 1 per cent. Moreover, statistics showed that the convalescence was much shorter and the recovery more complete. This was because the patients had not been severely drugged with quinine, calomel, or other strong poisons. He had, therefore, the greatest confidence in endeavouring to induce the African Section of the Chamber of Commerce to do its utmost to have missionaries and captains of vessels furnished with homœopathic medicines and directions, and to have homœopathic treatment introduced into the settlements on the coast. With about two dozen one-ounce bottles of homœopathic medicines and a few pages of directions, an intelligent missionary or captain would be able to effect much better results than an ordinary ship\'s doctor with the Government manual and chest of medicines, and to save many valuable lives that would otherwise be lost. It was not only in malarial fevers that the superiority of homœopathic treatment was to be seen. It was the same in dysentery, Asiatic cholera, typhus fever, sunstroke, pleurisy, pneumonia, bronchitis, and all other severe diseases. By doing their utmost to enable residents on the coast to obtain homœopathic treatment, the African Section of the Chamber would add another to the many and great services they had already rendered to Africa, and would earn the blessings of future victims of African fevers.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.712, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE CLIMATE OF THE GOLD COAST', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following is taken from an article from the pen of Dr. J. A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2. Avoid getting chilled by standing or sitting for any length of time when the body is unduly heated, or by neglecting to change underclothing as soon as possible after profuse sweating.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1887#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'So much has been said and written about the climate of West Africa, and it has been so long the fashion to abuse and condemn it without inquiry, that the medical profession, like the general public, have accepted and endorsed the common report as an established fact. It is therefore important to find such mischievous exaggerations combated by a medical officer, who writes of West Africa, not from hearsay evidence, but from the experience derived during a residence of twenty-three years in the colony of Sierra Leone and settlements of the Gold Coast. We make these remarks by way of introducing to more general notice the papers above noted, because they supply much valuable and novel information, not only regarding the diseases to which Europeans and natives are subject in West Africa, but because they furnish an interesting description of the topography of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.\n\nMr. Clarke is of opinion that the climate of West Africa, if fairly tested, can stand comparison in point of healthfulness with most of our colonies in the East or West Indies, where endemic and epidemic fevers, dysentery, with cholera to boot, prevail quite as frequently and fatally. There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years. Comparatively, their number is not small, comprehending persons of all classes—governors, civil and military officers, merchants, and missionaries, with their wives and families. He states ""that formerly many officers in the English, Dutch, and Danish service resided upon the Gold Coast, some fourteen, twenty, and thirty years,* and enjoyed good health, although those in subordinate positions had to remove from one station to another."" The fact ought no longer to be concealed, that half at least of the deaths and incapacities which occur amongst Europeans arise from errors of personal economy, and that the mortality lists are unfairly swelled by ascribing to the climate deaths which have been caused by accident or intemperance.\n\nThe following passages may be adduced as proof that the climate is not to blame for everything:—', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.742, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CLIMATE OF WESTERN AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I am not singular in believing that healthy Europeans coming to Africa to reside may do so with comparative safety, if they will only take proper precautions to preserve their health.

With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}]",True

In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim that lifestyle choices, diet, and neglect of precautions were more influential than climate, with significant regional variations impacting settlers' longevity. The articles frequently attribute many deaths to excessive alcohol consumption, poor diet, and lack of proper sanitation, noting that Europeans who adapted their lifestyle to the tropical environment tended to enjoy better health. They also highlight that regional factors, such as living on elevated ground or in areas with better sanitation, could significantly affect settlers' health and longevity. While acknowledging the inherent health risks of the West African climate, the articles emphasize the role of lifestyle and regional factors, aligning with the claim.

By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent.

From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths. From 50 to 80 per cent have or have had syphilis or yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm,"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.608, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A fragile population emerging from near stability', 'content': 'This picture is not in any way surprising.

Given the mortality levels described above (which is a conservative assumption in view of the fact that the health conditions of the forests of the west coast equatorial area have probably long been worse than elsewhere), the conclu› sion could be drawn that in the centuries past those areas averaging 5 births per woman had experienced population declines averaging over 0.5 per cent per annum, and those averaging 3.5 children declines of over 1.5 per cent per annum. This is inconceivable over any protracted period; the latter population would be halving every forty years, and both situations suggest much larger populations during the earlier years of European contact than has ever been suggested.

To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well.

Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A fragile population emerging from near stability', 'content': ""Confining our attention to the area outside the low fertility zone, we can hazard some reasonably good guesses about pre-modern sub-Saharan populations by employing stable population methods of analysis.

The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy.

But in many areas in East, Central and North Africa, what made their presence so inimical to Africans was that the Europeans came to occupy most of the fertile lands, while the Asiatics monopolized the retail and wholesale trade. In West Africa, too, the Asiatics - Syrian, Lebanese and Indians - whose population increased from only 28 in 1897 to 276 in 1900, 1910 in 1909, 3000 in 1929 and to 6000 by 1935 also drove out their African competitors. By 1935, this European and Asiatic problem had assumed very serious proportions for Africa and it has not been entirely resolved to this day.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.603, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 299, 'article_title': 'The (Colony of the) Gold Coast', 'full_section_title': 'The (Colony of the) Gold Coast', 'last_edit_date': '01-23-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1864#article-14', 'issue_date': '23_01_1864', 'content': 'This position altogether is so far clear. But we have been subject to such misrepresentations when combating stereotyped misstatements as regards West Africa, that we will not allow any one to misunderstand us. The opinions we put forward with regard to the climate of West Africa have not been hastily or crudely formed, nor have they been adopted to serve some temporary or interested purpose. They are the result of evidence that cannot be disproved. They are promulgated by us to remove prejudices which war against our efforts for the advancement of civilization in Africa, and because we feel that they are pregnant with most practical results. We do not, for instance, pretend that the West African climate is not unhealthy. We admit that it is. But we as fearlessly contend that it is not one whit more unhealthy for Europeans than many of the West India Islands, or than Hong Kong, China, or India, &c. These regions are equally liable to visitations of epidemic disease as is West Africa, in the shape of yellow fever, dysentery, &c. We are, moreover, firmly convinced that if ever the day arrives when complete, and not mere partial statistical tables, are compiled, showing the mortality amongst Europeans at the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and even the new settlement at Lagos, the facts fairly and impartially revealed will demonstrate that at least a moiety of the deaths which occur amongst them are not the result of climatic disease, but are chargeable occasionally to accident; more frequently to a lamentable and wanton neglect of ordinary care and precautions; and too often to reckless indulgences, which will in any climate sap the springs of life, and ultimately destroy it. As additional evidences in support of these statements, take, for example, the records with regard to the numerous governors who have served, or are now serving, in West Africa. We find that in most instances they were and are men who had passed middle life before being called upon to administer those Governments, and were consequently far less able to bear up against attacks of fever. Yet, of the thirty-four gentlemen who have governed Sierra Leone from 1792 to 1864, seven only died there in that long period of seventy-two years. Of those seven, one was killed in action, another veteran most unwisely made fruit and vegetables his sole diet; and one of them had previously lived upwards of thirty-five years in the colony, dying at sea, not of disease incident to the climate, but of cancer of the stomach. At the Gambia, none of the governors have died since 1837, when\n[January 23, 1864.]'}, {'id': 329, 'article_title': 'LAGOS', 'full_section_title': 'LAGOS', 'last_edit_date': '02-23-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1864#article-17', 'issue_date': '23_02_1864', 'content': ""Our local paper has been publishing some hasty statistics relative to comparative mortality in this place.

It is generally agreed that this is to be attributed to our superior mode of living, for the Spaniards, Portuguese, and Frenchmen are generally as hardy and as strong as we are.\n\nThe Chairman advised Europeans to adopt a diet of ""rice, weak tea, and mild tobacco."" Well, any white man who went in for such a diet should be either made of cast iron—if such a being could be manufactured—or else must be an idiotic candidate for a suicide\'s grave. Why, Kroomen cannot exist continually on rice; their diet has to be changed, in their own country, to corn, and, in factories down the Coast, to biscuit, with a free allowance of beef. A twelvemonth\'s diet of rice produces in most Kroomen valvular disease of the heart, with dropsy of the extremities and abdomen, and if the case is not treated at once, on the first signs of swelling in the feet, by change of diet, with medicine, death follows in a few days. Perhaps the Chairman can stand a diet that will kill a Krooman?\n\nWith regard to longevity of life in Africa, and the time a man can stay out without change of climate, much depends on where he resides. In Gambia, men have resided seven years at a time without leaving the place. On the Southwest Coast, men like Mr. Walker have resided three or more years without going to Europe or Madeira; while in the Bights three years is a long spell—eighteen months to two years being about the average time. Then a man, if he is even not very ill, feels the climate has so tried him that a few months\' change to the north is absolutely necessary. The same rule applies to the Gold, Ivory, and Grain Coasts. But it is more than likely that on elevated ground, say fifty miles up the country, on these coasts, like the station of the Swiss Mission, near Ackra, that men could reside in very decent health for much longer periods, provided they have good food—fresh food, not tinned.\n\nHalf the mortality in the towns of the Gold Coast is caused by want of proper sanitation. Where every native yard is a private cemetery, where in such yards cesspools, years old, are the rule, and the ground is saturated with sewage, where water has to be stored in tanks, and is bad—how can the towns be healthy, under a tropical sun? With any quantity of land in the neigh\n\nhood of such towns, there is no public cemetery for the natives. With the towns elevated above the sea, and washed by the surf of the Atlantic, there is no attempt at proper drainage, and the removal of sewage to the sea. The native prejudice as regards interments and dirt, must be respected, or the boasted liberty of the British subject would be infringed; and then a proper system of burial and drainage would cost money!'}]","[{'document_title': 'Climate of West Africa—Gold Mining—The Labour Question', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Now, first, as regards the climate and mode of living. With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—I read the paragraph in your paper of this month under the above title, and can add my testimony to the value of “Lamplough’s Pyretic Saline,” if not as a sure preventive, certainly as a deterrent and palliative in African fevers.\n\nIn your remarks, however, I find no mention made of the probable causes of such mortality, which I think is necessary when speaking of the effects of a climate like West Africa, the bad reputation of which is so very much exaggerated. Nor do you make any distinction between the colonies, classing Sierra Leone with Lagos, Gambia, and Cape Coast, which I am sure the facts would not warrant.\n\nTo revert, however, to the causes of mortality on the West Coast of Africa, I am of opinion that there are many influential causes conducing to the same which might be prevented, and I take the liberty of intruding on your valuable space to enumerate one or two of them.\n\n1. The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics. In Brazil, no doubt, some Europeans drink themselves to death, but they are few; the majority, being of a better class, prefer to live well and to enjoy themselves rationally, without making beasts of themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '2. The want of proper sanitary measures is another reason why the climate of West Africa proves fatal to many European constitutions. When streets and yards, both back and front of houses, are made the receptacles of filth and excrement, of putrified remains of dead dogs, cats, and other animal and vegetable matter, is it to be wondered at that the miasma rising from these dung-heaps eventually becomes fatal to those constantly inhaling it. This is a cause which it would be well for the colonial authorities here to take into their serious consideration, as it is most certainly a preventible one. It was only in 1871, during the administration of Mr. J. Pope Hennessy, that the sanitary condition of Freetown seriously occupied the attention of the Government; but whether that gentleman’s plans have ever been efficiently carried out, and what effects they have hitherto had there, we have no means here to ascertain.\n\n3. The Europeans on the West Coast of Africa, unlike their countrymen in India, South America, and elsewhere, perhaps for the reasons I have already stated, are so careless of their personal comfort, and so intent upon accumulating as much money as they can, that they deny themselves every convenience necessary in a tropical climate. In Sierra Leone, for instance, they live in the town, which is at the sea-shore, instead of on the mountains, where they would enjoy the sea breezes equally as well, and be in a cooler and healthier atmosphere. In support of this view, I will only quote a passage which occurs in a paper read by Mr. Hennessy before the Society of Arts in April, 1873, in which he says: “The mountain district (of Sierra Leone), according to the Registrar-General’s Returns, appears to be as healthy as any part of England, or indeed as Madeira, the climate of which it closely resembles.”\n\nI hope I have clearly shown that the large mortality on the West Coast of Africa is not entirely due to climatic influences, and that a great deal could be done by the Government and the Europeans to counteract and mitigate those influences. As living proofs of what I have stated, I beg to point out Mr. Magnus Smith, Mr. A. Montagu, Mr. Marston, and half-a-dozen others, who have resided in Sierra Leone for fifteen or twenty years without meeting with the same fate as their countrymen, and simply because they have known how to live.—I am, dear Sir,', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.637, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CLIMATE OF WESTERN AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In reference to your remarks upon the African climate, and also in reply to the letter signed ""One who has Escaped from the Jaws of Death,"" I may, as a resident of very many years on the West Coast, give it as my humble opinion that the climate is by no means so bad as many would wish to make it appear; New Orleans, some parts of China, and other places are more unhealthy. I could give you a list of a dozen or more personal friends, mostly traders, who have been on this Coast from ten to twenty years each, and are still strong, healthy men: it is true they have occasionally visited Europe during that time. Many young men shorten their lives by excess, carelessness, and exposure; *but I doubt if they would live long anywhere if they led such dissipated lives as they do here.* ""Climate"" is a common slang term for ""brandy,"" and is frequently employed ironically in that sense, because it is so much the fashion to attribute every death to ""that horrid climate,"" when those better informed know that a large proportion of Europeans hasten their own end by drink. One officer included among the victims of the Ashantee war was found dead in his bed, with a brandy bottle, nearly empty, under his pillow—at least, so ill-natured people said. Another victim of the said war died of epilepsy at Lagos, poor fellow! in fact, the ""war"" had to bear the blame of every death occurring among the troops at the time.\n\nThe much-abused traders, or ""palm-oil ruffians,"" as naval and military *gentlemen* politely term them after eating their dinners, drinking their wine, and perhaps winning their money, certainly undergo as many hardships and privations on many parts of the Coast as do their countrymen of the red coat and blue jacket; but by care and avoiding dissipation they manage to weather the ""climate"" for many years. I do not, however, wish to make any invidious comparison between the two classes; there are sober and steady, as there are dissipated and debauched, of each; how, then, is it the trader survives when the officer succumbs? Perhaps he who has escaped from the ""jaws of death"" (as I have done also several times) would say it is the consolatory hope of reaping ""pecuniary benefit."" It is at any rate somewhat strange that the traders who cannot run away from their business every time they are attacked by fever or dysentery should live, when the officer, who generally experiences little difficulty in getting invalided, should die. And I think this fact is a strong argument against those who abuse the traders and say they kill themselves with drink. One of the foremost in the rank of those who revile the traders was a certain ""young man about town,"" who came to ""flame"" in the ""virgin forest,"" ""kiss pretty savages,"" &c., and who experienced nothing but kindness and hospitality at the hands of the traders whom he met.

A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2. Avoid getting chilled by standing or sitting for any length of time when the body is unduly heated, or by neglecting to change underclothing as soon as possible after profuse sweating.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1887#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—A very large holder of shares in the West African Gold Mines has called my attention to a paragraph which appeared in the Daily News of March 17th, in which a correspondent of that journal ""earnestly expresses a hope that those who are offered shares in Gold Coast Mines will inform themselves of the deadly nature of the climate for Europeans,"" and also asserts that ""a white man cannot live there and work; the natives cannot be induced to work: as soon as a road is made the jungle grows over it again; the air is poisonous; and the people are debased beyond conception.""\n\nHaving first landed on the West Coast of Africa exactly thirty-one years ago, since which time I have spent less than six years in Europe, the remainder of the period being passed on the Coast, the Gold Coast Colony included, and, moreover, having returned from a visit of six months to the Gold Mines so recently as the end of July last, I trust that you will kindly permit me to contradict, in the most unqualified manner, all the statements of the unknown correspondent of the Daily News.\n\nThe mere fact that I have passed more than half my life in Western Equatorial Africa, including one continued residence there of ten, and another of five years, and am now in good health, and that I can name many Europeans and Americans who have spent as many, if not more, years there, is in itself a sufficient refutation of the supposed (and quite illusory) ""deadly nature of the climate for Europeans,"" when they are not constitutionally unfitted for residence in tropical regions, and will take proper care of themselves, and listen to the advice of ""old Coasters.""

We make these remarks by way of introducing to more general notice the papers above noted, because they supply much valuable and novel information, not only regarding the diseases to which Europeans and natives are subject in West Africa, but because they furnish an interesting description of the topography of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.\n\nMr. Clarke is of opinion that the climate of West Africa, if fairly tested, can stand comparison in point of healthfulness with most of our colonies in the East or West Indies, where endemic and epidemic fevers, dysentery, with cholera to boot, prevail quite as frequently and fatally. There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years. Comparatively, their number is not small, comprehending persons of all classes—governors, civil and military officers, merchants, and missionaries, with their wives and families. He states ""that formerly many officers in the English, Dutch, and Danish service resided upon the Gold Coast, some fourteen, twenty, and thirty years,* and enjoyed good health, although those in subordinate positions had to remove from one station to another."" The fact ought no longer to be concealed, that half at least of the deaths and incapacities which occur amongst Europeans arise from errors of personal economy, and that the mortality lists are unfairly swelled by ascribing to the climate deaths which have been caused by accident or intemperance.\n\nThe following passages may be adduced as proof that the climate is not to blame for everything:—', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of West Africa—Gold Mining—The Labour Question', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Chairman speaks of ""solid breakfasts, champagne lunches, heavy dinners at 7 P.M., and suppers after."" Now, when a man gets up at, say, 5.30 A.M., he takes a cup of coffee at 6 A.M., and breakfasts at 10 A.M., after a good morning\'s work, and this fits him to eat a substantial meal; this is about the hour all natives eat their first meal. As to lunches, if taken at all, they are far from being ""heavy""—unless on festive occasions; to drink champagne is the exception, and as it and Moselle are the most useful wines for the tropics, it is a pity that most people on the Coast cannot afford to use them more freely, especially during the rainy season, or on recovery from sickness. Dinner at 7 P.M. is the best hour; this is the hour all natives eat. The sun having set, the air is cooler, and people can then enjoy food better than at an earlier hour. As regards suppers, I have rarely seen them in any part of Africa I have visited, both East and West Coasts; I have not seen twelve supper parties in as many years, unless on board of some outward-bound mail steamer, among the newcomers and the officers of the steamer; men who go to bed at 10 to 11 P.M., after a comfortable dinner, could not take supper.\n\nAs to the use of spirits, that varies greatly. I have always found the consumption largest where the district was most swampy, and thus most unhealthy. As a general rule, after one leaves the Coast, say fifty miles, and gets to higher ground and purer air, if there is no endemic cause for ill-health, the taste for spirits grows less, and often disappears. In travelling up the Gambia I seldom use spirits. Now I dislike the taste. Years ago, when living in a branch of the Niger Delta, for three years I used only claret, and sometimes ale. I had no relish for spirits. In Bathurst, almost every Englishman has to use brandy or whisky; they feel the want of it; the climate requires it.

It is true that some of the officials that had been sent to the Gambia suffered much on account of the climate, but many of them (without disrespect) took advantage of the unfavourable report of the West Coast. We saw in the African Times of May 23rd, 1873, that Mr. Quin and others had an interview with the Earl of Kimberley about the affairs on the West Coast, but we were surprised to see that the Administrator, O\'Callaghan, ""had been compelled by ill health to resign."" We admit that Colonel Anton\'s health was totally ruined, which was the cause of his death; but if the life he led there had been closely watched, the authorities would not have come to the conclusion that he was affected by the climate. When the Administrator arrived here and saw the defenceless state of the Gambia, he thought of organizing a kind of Volunteer force; but this was without success. In fact, Mrs. O\'Callaghan was so very much dissatisfied and frightened at the place, that she would be extremely alarmed on hearing the report of a gun, and even the rumbling of carriage wheels. We were very much dissatisfied when we heard that his Excellency, who was stouter than when he entered the Gambia, was ordered home because of ill health, not knowing that he was looking out for another post. He even promised that he would report the state of the settlement on his arrival in England, that measures might be taken to rectify every defect in the place. We could show many instances to prove that our climate is not so unhealthy that Europeans could not live twenty-eight, thirty, forty-four, and even fifty-five years in it. Messrs. Goddard, Brown, Robertson, Chown, Quin, and Chief Justice Mantell are living testimonies of this settlement. The first of these gentlemen was a merchant who amassed a fortune; he lived in Bathurst a period of about fifty-five years, returned home, and died at the age of seventy-eight. The second, who is now in Bathurst, carrying on an extensive business, has been here for forty-four years, and his health, we venture to say, is improving every day. The third, who was the Colonial Surgeon and afterwards Secretary, resided in this settlement for thirty years, and has now retired to Scotland. The fourth, who was a merchant, took a residence in this place for twenty-five years, and returned home with a fortune. The fifth was of the same calling, resided here for the space of twenty-two years, made his fortune, and has taken his abode in England. The Chief Justice, also, stationed in this colony for twenty-eight years, is now holding a situation as a magistrate in England. Lawyer Montague, Smith and others are living testimonies of ""unhealthy"" Sierra Leone. There are others who might have been testimonies on behalf of the West Coast, but many of them died accidentally. We may therefore come to the conclusion that the climate on the West Coast is not altogether unhealthy.

High mortality rates are evident from reports of sickness and death among troops, overwhelmed hospitals, and soldiers being invalided home due to illness.

To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome.

Smallpox vaccination was on such a small scale that by the late 1930s a significant reduction of the disease had probably taken place only in the Gold Coast and southern Nigeria. 93 In contrast, contact with Europeans and participation in the First World War ensured that the influenza epidemic of 1918-19 swept through Africa probably resulting in the highest annual death rate this century, although the rise in death rates was probably not as great as in Asia, for many African populations were still protected by comparative isolation. Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.592, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A fragile population emerging from near stability', 'content': ""The main aim here will be to examine those influences which may have caused long-term population change as well as those which may have had more dramatic short-term effects within the last century. It is commonly assumed that the major constraint on population numbers in traditional societies has been the availability of food. However, E. Boserup has argued that critical population densities do not lead to a Malthusian situation but to changes in the methods of cultivation: 'the low rates of population growth found (until recently) in pre-industrial communities cannot be explained as the result of insufficient food supplies due to overpopulation, and we must leave room for other factors in the explanation of demographic trends ... medical, biological, political, etc.'$^{22}$ The African past may well have been more complex than this and the ultimate bounds may have been those of food resources, even though infrequently brought into play. The land available for farming was that land not proscribed by other uses; for instance, the nearly deserted land between warring kingdoms had alternative employment as a no-man's land. In much of the continent little land appeared to be in use at any one time, either because slash-and-burn or savanna shifting cultivation meant that most land at any given time was fallow or because hunters and food gatherers needed huge areas for their support. Only occasionally did extreme famine conditions strike, caused by drought or locusts or by the disorganization arising from war or epidemic. The crisis was usually too sudden to allow any substantial temporary invasion of the fallow,$^{23}$ and in effect the limits of the carrying capacity of the land were reached with resulting huge mortality and a drop in population numbers for decades. The pressure on the capacity of the system to produce food was usually - but not always - too short and sudden to produce the successive changes in methods of land use that Boserup describes. Such changes are most likely when population numbers push persistently against the food-producing capacity of the cultivation system either in a situation where the great peaks of mortality have been reduced by health measures or other actions or where luck or geographical conditions moderate those peaks. For decades subsequent to the crisis, populations remained well below the level at which they pressed on food supplies;$^{24}$ they grew, but only at a modest rate, because they were still subject to the ravages of fearful diseases.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered. Yellow fever epidemics have occurred from Senegal to Sudan at unpredictable intervals. By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

It may have remained constant, as the evidence of the age structure recorded over fifty years by the censuses of the Gold Coast and Ghana suggest.

The other is the possibility that the population has not been stationary, but has been averaging a rate of growth of up to 0.5 per cent per annum for several centuries (for reasons which will be discussed below). The full range of possibilities allows us to describe a society where women averaged 5.5-7 live births yielding a birth rate of 42-50 per thousand, and where the expectation of life at birth was 20-30 years yielding a death rate of 38-50 per thousand and an infant mortality rate of 250-375 deaths per thousand live births. A medium assumption might be a situation where women averaged little more than six live births, where population growth averaged 0.33 per cent, where the expectation of life at birth was about 22.5 years (about the level of Rome at the end of the Republic)$^{20}$ and where the crude birth rate was about 48 per thousand, the crude death rate 45 per thousand and the infant mortality rate 300-350 per thousand.

Given the mortality levels described above (which is a conservative assumption in view of the fact that the health conditions of the forests of the west coast equatorial area have probably long been worse than elsewhere), the conclu› sion could be drawn that in the centuries past those areas averaging 5 births per woman had experienced population declines averaging over 0.5 per cent per annum, and those averaging 3.5 children declines of over 1.5 per cent per annum.

This drought had spread over the entire Sudan area, from Senegal to Wadai and Chad. From periodic shortages, the situation worsened to a devastating famine which claimed probably 250000 to 300000 victims,$^{42}$ alleviated only by the 4000 tonnes of cereals that the French Soudan (now Mali) had had neither the means nor the time to ship to France. 43 In AEF where forced sales continued into the following decade in order to provision the Congo-OcØan railway projects, famine, which had begun in 1918, spread to the northern half of the country (Woleu-Ntem) between 1922 and 1925; it probably reduced the Fang population by half, from 140000 to 65000 in 1933. 44 The weakened populations then fell a prey to epidemics: renewed out› breaks of smallpox and especially the spread of Spanish influenza imported from Europe, from which perhaps one-tenth of the population of AEF perished. 45 Though not always accompanied by such disastrous results, the famine problem resulting from food shortages caused by the colonial system was a recurrent feature of the period.

A growth rate as low as 0.5 per cent per annum (yielded by a birth rate only five points per thousand above the death rate) results in a fifteen-fold increase over a millennium. Even if Africa's population were as high as 150 million in 1900, it is highly improbable that the continent would have contained no more than 10 million people a thousand years earlier.\nThus it is possible to think of pre-modern death rates as having been within five points of the birth rate. Cautions should be added. This is an average over a very long period. The whole continent may have seen population oscillations over the last millennium, and almost certainly many individual societies have experienced disastrous population decline with subsequent recovery. It would, however, be surprising if recovery had ever been achieved by natural increase rates much over 1 per cent per annum in North Africa before the early nineteenth century or in subSaharan Africa before the end of the century.

It is generally considered that communities that gradually take up agriculture and animal husbandry continue for a long time to show a low annual growth rate (between 0.05 and 0.10 per cent), which is fairly close to the known growth rate of hunting and food-gathering communities. On the other hand, communities with a more diversified agriculture have a much higher annual growth rate, put between 0.10 and 0.15 per cent. Figures for a difficult natural environment like that of Africa are unknown: but they are no doubt not very far from this model. Spread over more than two centuries, an increase of this order in the growth rate would have had a considerable effect on the overall population of Central Africa. 6\nCompared with twentieth-century growth rates these figures admittedly seem low. The fact is that in early African communities the death rate remained high. For the nineteenth century the main causes of death are known, but it is impossible to determine the extent of each one's con› tribution to the total.\nFirst, there were historical factors, especially the slave trade and its attendant violence. While the manpower drain of the slave trade to America was sharply reduced as from the 1850s, the Swahili and Arab trade took over to the east and north of our area. Figures can be given of overall losses for the whole of Central Africa,$^{7}$ but it is unlikely that it will ever be possible to give a geographical breakdown, especially as the continual movement of groups and individuals spread the impact of the slave trade far and wide.\nThere were also ecological and epidemiological factors. The nineteenth century certainly saw the beginnings of medical progress in Central Africa, such as better knowledge of endemic diseases, use of vaccination and more general use of quinine. But this progress remained confined to the circles visited by traders from Angola or the Swahili coast.

Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

This uplands shift in population continues today. It involves transitions in production and diet among those pressing upland, the compression of population in the higher elevations, and the expansion of Luo-speaking communities. The process of upland migration has produced some of the highest rural population densities in Africa in the twentieth century, contributing to the exhaustion of soil and the depletion of forest and woodland reserves. 19 Those who did not migrate upland continued to suffer the shortfalls of a fragile agricultural system. The occasional markets offered some relief, permitting the exchange of cattle, grazed in the lowlands, for grain and root crops grown more successfully at the higher elevations. Since, in the lowlands, the period of hunger was also the period of heaviest labour demand for cultivating and sowing of grains in the first rains, the occasional markets provided a means of overcoming rather quickly the excessively long dry season or an earlier short harvest.

This will permit of, at least, a partial move being made. The Naval Brigade will, therefore, advance; Russell and Wood starting from Dompiassie before they reach that place, and the whole going on some eight or more miles beyond this place. ... In Coomassie the Queen Mother is at the head of the peace party, and, it is said, threatens to destroy herself if war is persisted in. Our experience of Queesa and of this town enables us to understand the terrible scourge of dysentery from which the Ashantees suffered during the rainy season in their camp at Mampon. They are certainly civilized far beyond any African race. Their houses show a high degree of finish and comfort, and are as far superior to the mud huts, which are all the Fantees, after two hundred years' contact with the white man at Cape Coast can accomplish, that every one is struck with wonder and admiration at the contrast. People accustomed to live a comparatively civilized life, must, indeed, have suffered terribly from their privations in the bush during tropical rains of unexampled severity. No wonder that the awful scourge of small-pox was supplemented by an epidemic of dysentery, and that between them half the army was swept away! Had we had any conception at home of the sufferings of the enemy, and of the enormous loss of life, we need never have dispatched Sir Garnet Wolseley, an officer, or a white soldier to the Coast. The survivors of the invading army would have been only too glad to crawl back to their own country, and the tales of the sufferings they had undergone, and the losses they had suffered, would have sufficed to secure the protectorate from an invasion for many a long day. I am not, of course, saying that the lesson would have been so severe, or the moral effect one tithe as crushing as it has been, but I do say that the remembrance of those terrible six months would have lasted in the memory of all who returned to tell the tale in their comfortable, well-built villages for the rest of their lives. As it was, the invasion was by no means generally popular. The chiefs were, we now know, assembled nearly three months before their followers joined them, and if such was the reluctance when they expected victory and plunder, it would have been hard indeed to induce them to renew the attempt while the memory of those 20,000 graves in Fantee land remained in their minds.\n\n**INVALIDS, ETC., FROM THE GOLD COAST EXPEDITION.**""}]","[{'document_title': 'Medical Remarks re the African Climate and the Ashanti War', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The *Medical Times and Gazette* says: ""The first batch of invalids resulting from the \'little war\' forced upon us by the King of Ashanti have just reached this country in the Himalaya, and have been transferred to Haslar Hospital.

The head-quarters of the 2nd West India Regiment were only disembarked at Cape Coast on July 11 last; but although from the nature of their constant duties in the tropics, they might have been expected to be somewhat acclimatized; they speedily began to suffer from the prevailing forms of fever and dysentery. Many of the officers were attacked; the colonel of the regiment has come home in the Himalaya invalided, and the adjutant died a few days before the news left.\n\nA correspondent writes to the *Pall Mall Gazette*: ""The invalids from the West Coast of Africa state that dysentery and fever were engendered by the supply of bad water and defective salt provisions. They assert, and they have not been contradicted, that the pork stored at Cape Coast Castle for the use of the garrison and troops, is inferior in quality, and therefore not fit to be served out. The fever which has proved so fatal to the Royal Artillery is one of a bilious type.""\n\n**Hints for the Ashanti Expedition.**—We would advise officers and others to provide themselves with as few things as practicable by way of outfit for the field; to wear flannel or serge; have good boots and a light, easy head-dress; to avoid spirits, as a rule; to use condensed or boiled water whenever practicable, and to use filtered water when not—a pocket filter being provided for that purpose; to take a certain quantity of quinine as a daily article of diet, and not as a medicine, and always to begin the day with a good breakfast, and end it by taking care to guard against malaria by some covering above and waterproof sheet below, lighting a fire whenever practicable. It might be worth while for officers to provide themselves with a small respirator, to be worn when exposed to the night air. These are now being procured of very small size, and capable of being worn inside the lips, so as to be invisible.

It is constructed at the base of a gradual descent; so that when, as of late, it rains very heavily, all around the camp is something like a mud swamp. The bush having been only so lately cleared, the earth which has thus become exposed cannot be expected to exhale anything else but malaria, and therefore it will be contrary to all the rules of hygiene to expect the camp at Prahsoo to be healthy. Its close proximity to the river, although pleasant, tends, of course, to increase the dampness of the encampment. The contrast between the atmosphere during the day and night is too sudden for health, the variation being more than 20 degrees. Whilst the excitement lasted there was very little sickness, but after a residence of sixteen days one, and another, and another, became so dreadfully ill, that the medical officer in charge was obliged to invalid them to the seacoast; so that within eight weeks of their arrival in the bush nearly the whole of the officers left the Prah for Cape Coast in a dreadful state. The troops arrived at the Prah about the 1st February, and on the 8th April, when the Tamar anchored in Cape Coast roadstead, there were fourteen officers of the 4th West at the Castle; and such was their state of health, that at the dinner given to *fête* the arrival of the reinforcement, only one was able to leave his bed and meet them, and even he was in a dreadful state of debility. Out of twenty-six officers who left the Coast for the field, fifteen, or thereabout, have been invalided home, in a very precarious state, three have died, and four are still obliged to keep their bed, though not sufficiently ill to be invalided. Of the soldiers many have died, principally from dysentery. A great many are so weak, that, in all probability, they will not be fit for active service in the field for the next twelve months. Of the twelve medical officers on the Coast, three have been invalided, one has died, and three are still prostrated with fever. Of the soldiers of the detachment of the 1st West India Regiment sent up to Prahsoo on the 24th April, we gather from the report of the medical officer in charge that seventeen were admitted into hospital within three days of their arrival in the camp, and that an average of twenty were daily reported sick. Such, then, is the present position of the troops on the Gold Coast. It is dreadful to both Africans and Europeans; and should the Government intend to have it supplied with troops from the West Indies, it must be prepared to find means of properly rationing them with fresh provisions. It is a great pity to bring a lot of men here to sacrifice their lives; and whenever a lasting peace is proclaimed between our Government and the King of Ashantee, I think it will not be an imprudent act to have the Coast supplied, according to the recommendation of Sir Benjamin Pine, with a strong police constabulary and a small detachment of only about 100 men. The troops on the whole of the West Coast should, I also think, be under the command of a major-general, whose residence should be at Sierra Leone, and the detachment here should be relieved every year. This will be a very great improvement on all sides, both for the officers and men, and the mortality will be by far less than it would be if the men were to be fed continually for three years on salt beef and pork.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-05-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1864#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sanitariums for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'M\'Carthy\'s Island, River Gambia, Dec. 20, 1864.\n\nMy Lord,—In the editorial article in the Lancet of October 13, page 442, we find the remark that ""it is a singular fact in medical geography that from St. Louis, Senegal, on the north, to Mossamedes, on the south, there is not upon the seaboard a single healthy acre of ground. The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ASHANTEE WAR', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Prahsoo camp, as all who have been here are aware, is situated at the foot of a gradual descent toward the river. The roads to it are in many parts covered with swamps and pools of stagnant water, which during the heavy rains present great obstruction to travellers. The camp, in its present condition, on account of the frequent heavy rains which we have had, is nearly under water, with the exception of a few elevated spots. Two days of sunshine after this inundation convert the pools into muddy, pestiferous swamps, breeding that baneful poison which produces the most deleterious effects on the constitution. All the unoccupied ground of the camp is now covered with alga and fungi, emitting the most stinking and deadly vapour, especially when the morning sun falls upon it. The temporary bamboo sheds built by the forces, to be occupied only during the short period they were expected to remain here before they crossed over the Ashantee frontier, on active operations, are, I contend, perfectly insufficient to shelter them from the effects of those pestiferous swamps and of the damp weather of the rainy season. It is therefore no wonder that Prahsoo should now have become a great hospital, instead of a place where officers and men are expected to be in an efficient state to oppose an enemy who will never cross the river, swollen as it is at this season. Even the huts are surrounded by swamps, which defy all the attempts of Lieutenant Roberts at drainage, and through the roofs of most of them the rain pours down as through a sieve. They are consequently wet and most unhealthy. The result is what might be expected; out of a force of 200 men of the 1st West India Regiment who arrived here about the 1st of the month (Tamar troops), there were no less than nineteen admitted to hospital during the first week; whilst the first week of the force of 300 men of the 4th West India Regiment who arrived here before the rains only gave twelve to hospital; there is therefore a difference of seven. This difference gradually increased, and we find in the second week the admittance of the 1st West was twenty-nine, whilst that of the 4th at the former period in the second week was only eighteen. In the third week the proportion was still greater; the admittance in the 4th West in their third week had been only fourteen, whilst the effect of the continuous rains and the consequent pernicious change of the sanitary condition of the camp has been such as to cause the admission of one out of every four men in the camp into hospital—viz., fifty-three—showing that during the first three weeks, of the 300 men of the 4th West India Regiment before the rains there were only forty-four admittances, whilst during the same period, but in a different season, of the 200 men of the 1st West India Regiment there were 101 admitted into hospital.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1864#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.71, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sickness and Death among the Gold Coast Troops', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""are said not to be made with rosewater, campaigns in unhealthy tropical climates can never be as harmless as picnic parties.

But no; the health of the forces was good from August, 1863, until some three weeks after they had marched in several directions into the bush of the interior. The mortality and sickness has occurred only since the end of February, with few exceptions. The local error committed we deem to have been this: The rains commenced two months before their time. We think that on the very first day of rain, all idea of further duty in the field should have been abandoned, and nearly all the troops have been ordered back to Cape Coast Castle without delay. When once the rains began, no troops could go into Ashantee, and no Ashantees would come into the Territories. Again, the campaign being over, we think the Tamar's men, who would otherwise have been marched up to camp immediately, where there were rations, &c., for fifty or sixty days, ought not to have been landed, there being no adequate accommodation for them. But the great sickness and death was not among these men, but among those who had been at Prahsoo and other up-country stations.\n\nWe hope that now the party battle has been fought, men will reason calmly about events which, though deplorable, have not the gravity that has been attributed to them. We never hear it said, when some regiment in India has been sent on necessary service, and the cholera has decimated it, that Government or the authorities deserve impeachment for sending men on such an expedition. And why should the case be different in Africa? We know, by news from the camp itself, that all necessary medicines and medical comforts were there. But the exhalations of a lately uncovered soil were poisonous; as also the water, which no attempt seems to have been made to purify, though sand was abundant, and charcoal enough might have been burned in a few days to form a filter bed for an army, instead of for a mere battalion.

My informant told me that Colonel Conran was unable to do so, although he saw how desirable and necessary such a step is, because his Excellency Governor Pine, when embarking, left strict orders to Judge Hackett, the Lieut.-Governor, that the Ashantee frontiers were to be guarded, and the troops were not to be withdrawn, and he, the Judge, consequently refused to permit the withdrawal.

In the fourth week, of the 4th West India Regiment, when the weather was comparatively healthy, the number of men admitted was only ten, whilst the actual number in hospital was fourteen—viz., fourteen men in hospital with a force of 300 men, or a little more than four per cent., and now with a force of 200 men, within the same period, there are no less than 100 men in hospital, or fifty per cent.

A little beyond Prahsoo, about three and a-half miles, lying E.N.E. half E., is the town of Atawascoo, and about half-a-mile from that place there is a cataract right across the river, formed by a layer of rocks, through which, during the dry season, an enemy can easily walk. During the late Ashantee invasion the greater part of the division under Essa Ma Quantah crossed over at Atawascoo and at this cataract, as is evident from the number of dilapidated tents to be found under cover of the high trees. This cataract, of course, during the rainy weather is a very dangerous path, and no one would attempt to cross by it. Again, there are fordable paths lower down the river, at some distance from Prahsoo, which no force at that place could protect. If the King of Ashantee intends to attack the camp, it is not to be supposed that he will be so idiotic as to send a small force of one or two thousand men, but he will send from twenty to thirty thousand. If 6,000 cross over at Atawascoo, and before the force at Prahsoo knows what it is about push on to Assempah Naya, on the road to the seacoast, thus entirely cutting off our retreat; another 4,000 cross over the third bend of the river below the camp, thus presenting themselves on the flank of the Prahsoo; and a small body of men appear before the fortified stockaded front of Prahsoo to draw our attention—what on earth could a small force of 200 men at Prahsoo do, 100 of whom are sick in hospital and fifty just out of hospital, and as weak as could be imagined? A sharp commander would at once get his sick into the stockade, with the whole of the people in the camp, excepting those on guard; but one night surprise by the Ashantees would prove a finale, as there would be a general shooting in the stockade. Of what use, then, are the handful of men left at the Prah?

To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures.

Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns against epidemic disease apparently gained some success. The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered. Yellow fever epidemics have occurred from Senegal to Sudan at unpredictable intervals. By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

On the other hand, communities with a more diversified agriculture have a much higher annual growth rate, put between 0.10 and 0.15 per cent.

From periodic shortages, the situation worsened to a devastating famine which claimed probably 250000 to 300000 victims,$^{42}$ alleviated only by the 4000 tonnes of cereals that the French Soudan (now Mali) had had neither the means nor the time to ship to France. 43 In AEF where forced sales continued into the following decade in order to provision the Congo-OcØan railway projects, famine, which had begun in 1918, spread to the northern half of the country (Woleu-Ntem) between 1922 and 1925; it probably reduced the Fang population by half, from 140000 to 65000 in 1933. 44 The weakened populations then fell a prey to epidemics: renewed out› breaks of smallpox and especially the spread of Spanish influenza imported from Europe, from which perhaps one-tenth of the population of AEF perished. 45 Though not always accompanied by such disastrous results, the famine problem resulting from food shortages caused by the colonial system was a recurrent feature of the period. It recurred, for example, in 1928-9 in Ruanda, the 'granary' of the Belgian Congo, following another drought, 46 and was indeed the sign of the fragility of countries exhausted by the Øconomie de traite despite the rise in export figures."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.048, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The years from the early 1880s to the mid-iojos mark the demographic divide in Africa.

In 1880 a European presence inland from the coast was largely restricted to Algeria, where a third of a million migrants, mainly from France, Spain, Italy and Malta, had consolidated the victory of the French army, and South Africa, where a similar number of Europeans, predominantly of Dutch and English extraction, now had a vanguard as far north as the Limpopo river.

By 1935 European administations controlled almost the entire continent (see Fig. 12.2). The half century saw European medical science progressing from an ignorance of the cause of most of Africa's major diseases to an ability to contain or cure most of them; indeed the period ends just as the sulpha drugs were ushering in an era of chemotherapy of great significance for the continent.

The purchasing power of the natives was reduced to a greater extent than in any of the earlier crises.' 48 It is revealing that, in Francophone Africa, large-scale urban immigration began precisely when the great crisis occurred. Notwithstanding the overall stagnation in population growth (in AOF 14.4 million inhabitants in 1931, as compared with 14.6 million in 1936), the towns and cities began to be swollen by the massive influx of destitute peasants, in spite of the fact that the urban employment situation was also critical. In 1936, for example, there were still no more than 167000 wage-earners in AOF, which was hardly more than 1% of the population. Nevertheless, between 1931 and 1936 the populations of Dakar and Abidjan increased by 71%, while that of Conakry doubled. Even more revealing is the case of an impoverished little town in the interior like Ouagadougou which, reversing its previous trend, increased its population by one-third over the same period. The overall stagnation in population growth during this period is parti› cularly indicative of the prevailing state of poverty.

The other is the possibility that the population has not been stationary, but has been averaging a rate of growth of up to 0.5 per cent per annum for several centuries (for reasons which will be discussed below). The full range of possibilities allows us to describe a society where women averaged 5.5-7 live births yielding a birth rate of 42-50 per thousand, and where the expectation of life at birth was 20-30 years yielding a death rate of 38-50 per thousand and an infant mortality rate of 250-375 deaths per thousand live births. A medium assumption might be a situation where women averaged little more than six live births, where population growth averaged 0.33 per cent, where the expectation of life at birth was about 22.5 years (about the level of Rome at the end of the Republic)$^{20}$ and where the crude birth rate was about 48 per thousand, the crude death rate 45 per thousand and the infant mortality rate 300-350 per thousand.

By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent. There were two reasons for the trade: firstly that alcohol could be produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits; secondly, in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, there were real problems about what goods would be accepted in return for the produce of Africa.$^{43}$ Mary Kingsley found the trade spirit pure and likely to do less harm than cannabis,$^{44}$ a view shared by a committee that investigated the liquor trade in içoç.$^{45}$ Spirits were distributed on a huge scale, frequently as wages.

This completely disrupted the farm calendar though the precariousness of the rains made farming times particularly important. The supplies of millet, noncompulsory, depended entirely on the local chiefs. In 1931, the refusal of the administration to lower the head tax, and its insistence on collective payment, which forced the peasants to pay also for deserters and for deceased people, led to a situation in which, as one report put it, 'entire villages vanished ... and an age group was completely decimated'$^{47}$ with, in some areas, a mortality rate of over 50%."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.048, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': ""Famines and psychological stress also left the uprooted and malnourished vulnerable to infectious diseases carried by the coastal traders. Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade.

This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '2. The want of proper sanitary measures is another reason why the climate of West Africa proves fatal to many European constitutions. When streets and yards, both back and front of houses, are made the receptacles of filth and excrement, of putrified remains of dead dogs, cats, and other animal and vegetable matter, is it to be wondered at that the miasma rising from these dung-heaps eventually becomes fatal to those constantly inhaling it. This is a cause which it would be well for the colonial authorities here to take into their serious consideration, as it is most certainly a preventible one. It was only in 1871, during the administration of Mr. J. Pope Hennessy, that the sanitary condition of Freetown seriously occupied the attention of the Government; but whether that gentleman’s plans have ever been efficiently carried out, and what effects they have hitherto had there, we have no means here to ascertain.\n\n3. The Europeans on the West Coast of Africa, unlike their countrymen in India, South America, and elsewhere, perhaps for the reasons I have already stated, are so careless of their personal comfort, and so intent upon accumulating as much money as they can, that they deny themselves every convenience necessary in a tropical climate. In Sierra Leone, for instance, they live in the town, which is at the sea-shore, instead of on the mountains, where they would enjoy the sea breezes equally as well, and be in a cooler and healthier atmosphere. In support of this view, I will only quote a passage which occurs in a paper read by Mr. Hennessy before the Society of Arts in April, 1873, in which he says: “The mountain district (of Sierra Leone), according to the Registrar-General’s Returns, appears to be as healthy as any part of England, or indeed as Madeira, the climate of which it closely resembles.”\n\nI hope I have clearly shown that the large mortality on the West Coast of Africa is not entirely due to climatic influences, and that a great deal could be done by the Government and the Europeans to counteract and mitigate those influences. As living proofs of what I have stated, I beg to point out Mr. Magnus Smith, Mr. A. Montagu, Mr. Marston, and half-a-dozen others, who have resided in Sierra Leone for fifteen or twenty years without meeting with the same fate as their countrymen, and simply because they have known how to live.—I am, dear Sir,', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sanitariums for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'But Western Africa has hitherto not been thought worthy of much consideration and attention, and therefore officers who have been sent to command the troops in it have scarcely any means for preserving their health. I deny in toto the statement that upon the seaboard there is not a single healthy acre of ground, and this I shall endeavour to prove; and also point out which (in my opinion as medical officer on the staff attached to the troops serving on this Coast for the last six years) will be the best sanitarium the Government could and ought to select, and where both military and colonial hospitals should be erected.\n\nI am perfectly aware, my Lord, that the Cameroons Mountains, situated in the Bight of Biafra, near to Fernando Po, have been recommended by the late Captain William Allen and Dr. Thompson, of the Niger expedition, and, more recently, by no less a distinguished traveller than Captain Burton. This last gave as his opinion, ""that a few thousands spent at Cameroons or Fernando Po would, calculating only the market value of seamen\'s lives, repay themselves in as many years."" But the pros and cons of that lofty range as a sanitarium must be considered, and officers on the Coast should be consulted before the Home Government attempt to spend a large amount on it. There are many advantages in its favour, as may be seen described in the work of Captain Burton, on ""Abeokuta and the Cameroons,"" but there are also some great disadvantages attaching to it as a military sanitarium.\n\nIts distance from the different military stations on the Coast is one great objection, as it is situated about 400 miles below the last—viz., Lagos. It will be no great consolation for a sick officer—laid up, perhaps, with intractable fever, debility, diarrhœa, or dysentery, to be ordered, say, from the Gambia or Sierra Leone, to the Cameroons Mountains, a distance of about 2,000 miles, in a steam-packet, which is most uncomfortable, and unadapted for the conveyance of the sick during a voyage of eighteen days, in a direction quite opposite to the accustomed route—viz., to Teneriffe, Madeira, or England. The result would be found invariably to be that most of the cases, and certainly all the serious dysenteric cases, would succumb before the patient could reach the mountain of good hope. As a naval sanitarium it would be excellent, as it is in the neighbourhood of the rendezvous of the West African squadron, extending from the Volta to the Island of Ascension; and of the great oil rivers, to which so many English merchant vessels resort.

It was a most distressing sight to witness the arrival of these poor creatures; and it is necessary to make a few preliminary remarks in order clearly to understand the difficulties with which the medical officers had to contend. The appearance of the slaves when landed was most striking. In some the expression of the countenance indicated sufferings, moral and physical, of the most profound and agonising nature. Others of them gazed vacantly around them in the most utter helplessness. Occasionally, among the newly-arrived groups all sense of suffering was merged in melancholic or raving madness. The wizened, shrunk, and skinny features were lighted up by the hollow, feverish eye. The belly was, as it were, tacked to the back, whilst the hip-bones protruded, and, in some cases, became the seat of foul, sloughing ulcers. The hand and skinny fingers seemed much elongated by the great and neglected growth of the nails, and they were so deplorably emaciated, that the skin appeared tensely stretched over, and tied down to the skeleton. The legs refused to perform their functions, and they reeled and tottered about from sheer debility. Their squalor and extreme wretchedness was heightened, in many cases, by the particoloured evacuations with which their bodies were besmeared. When large numbers of the sick were suffering from dysentery, the condition of the wards and yards in the morning was extremely loathsome. This was in a great degree unavoidable, as the sick were too weak to crawl from their mats to the commode, although everything was done under the surgeons\' orders to keep the wards as clean and wholesome as the crowded state of the hospital would admit of."" In a word, ""the moral and physical causes of depression were often so overwhelming, and so intensely concentrated, that the combination produced disease in such formidable shapes as to be beyond remedy. The mortality was consequently very great; many persons brought to the hospital in the last stage of disease died a few hours after their arrival; others even expired by the way. A large proportion died within a few days; and as the names of all these persons were recorded in the hospital books, the percentage of deaths was thereby largely increased.""\n\n*(To be continued.)*', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The (Colony of the)', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'This position altogether is so far clear. But we have been subject to such misrepresentations when combating stereotyped misstatements as regards West Africa, that we will not allow any one to misunderstand us. The opinions we put forward with regard to the climate of West Africa have not been hastily or crudely formed, nor have they been adopted to serve some temporary or interested purpose. They are the result of evidence that cannot be disproved. They are promulgated by us to remove prejudices which war against our efforts for the advancement of civilization in Africa, and because we feel that they are pregnant with most practical results. We do not, for instance, pretend that the West African climate is not unhealthy. We admit that it is. But we as fearlessly contend that it is not one whit more unhealthy for Europeans than many of the West India Islands, or than Hong Kong, China, or India, &c. These regions are equally liable to visitations of epidemic disease as is West Africa, in the shape of yellow fever, dysentery, &c. We are, moreover, firmly convinced that if ever the day arrives when complete, and not mere partial statistical tables, are compiled, showing the mortality amongst Europeans at the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and even the new settlement at Lagos, the facts fairly and impartially revealed will demonstrate that at least a moiety of the deaths which occur amongst them are not the result of climatic disease, but are chargeable occasionally to accident; more frequently to a lamentable and wanton neglect of ordinary care and precautions; and too often to reckless indulgences, which will in any climate sap the springs of life, and ultimately destroy it. As additional evidences in support of these statements, take, for example, the records with regard to the numerous governors who have served, or are now serving, in West Africa. We find that in most instances they were and are men who had passed middle life before being called upon to administer those Governments, and were consequently far less able to bear up against attacks of fever. Yet, of the thirty-four gentlemen who have governed Sierra Leone from 1792 to 1864, seven only died there in that long period of seventy-two years. Of those seven, one was killed in action, another veteran most unwisely made fruit and vegetables his sole diet; and one of them had previously lived upwards of thirty-five years in the colony, dying at sea, not of disease incident to the climate, but of cancer of the stomach.

A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2. Avoid getting chilled by standing or sitting for any length of time when the body is unduly heated, or by neglecting to change underclothing as soon as possible after profuse sweating.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1887#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Fatal Epidemic at Senegal', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'By letters from Bathurst we are informed that the epidemic at Senegal is very terrible, the latest advices from thence reporting over 600 deaths.', 'last_edit_date': '1879-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1879#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—I read the paragraph in your paper of this month under the above title, and can add my testimony to the value of “Lamplough’s Pyretic Saline,” if not as a sure preventive, certainly as a deterrent and palliative in African fevers.\n\nIn your remarks, however, I find no mention made of the probable causes of such mortality, which I think is necessary when speaking of the effects of a climate like West Africa, the bad reputation of which is so very much exaggerated. Nor do you make any distinction between the colonies, classing Sierra Leone with Lagos, Gambia, and Cape Coast, which I am sure the facts would not warrant.\n\nTo revert, however, to the causes of mortality on the West Coast of Africa, I am of opinion that there are many influential causes conducing to the same which might be prevented, and I take the liberty of intruding on your valuable space to enumerate one or two of them.\n\n1. The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics. In Brazil, no doubt, some Europeans drink themselves to death, but they are few; the majority, being of a better class, prefer to live well and to enjoy themselves rationally, without making beasts of themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'So much has been said and written about the climate of West Africa, and it has been so long the fashion to abuse and condemn it without inquiry, that the medical profession, like the general public, have accepted and endorsed the common report as an established fact.

We make these remarks by way of introducing to more general notice the papers above noted, because they supply much valuable and novel information, not only regarding the diseases to which Europeans and natives are subject in West Africa, but because they furnish an interesting description of the topography of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.\n\nMr. Clarke is of opinion that the climate of West Africa, if fairly tested, can stand comparison in point of healthfulness with most of our colonies in the East or West Indies, where endemic and epidemic fevers, dysentery, with cholera to boot, prevail quite as frequently and fatally. There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years. Comparatively, their number is not small, comprehending persons of all classes—governors, civil and military officers, merchants, and missionaries, with their wives and families.

The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits.

The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas.

Many Xhosa were prevented from settling in their former lands west of the Keiskamma, which were now parcelled out to the Mfengu 'loyalists' and white farmers.

The ultimate answer in the contest for power in Africa therefore depended on the monopolization of arms and ammunition. This was not easy to achieve as long as Europeans pursued national interests and African rulers could play off one power against another. Moreover, in the essential search for allies, Europeans had to use the supply of quality guns to bargain for treaties, concessions, neutrality or active participation in wars against rival African states. It therefore became essential to regulate their Scramble on the basis of international agreements and, in particular, to limit the supply of arms and ammunition. The most intense rivalry was between the British and the French. The British tried to secure their interests by also playing the role of protectors of Portuguese interests. This gave Bismarck the opportunity to play the role of an interested broker by convening an International Conference in Berlin. This Conference in turn gave King Leopold his chance to seek for international support for his ambitions on the Congo by proclaiming free trade and humanitarian antislavery ambitions.$^{24}$ This prepared the way for the Brussels Act which banned the supply of arms to African rulers in the name of an anti-slavery campaign.\nThe truth was that by linking the limitation of arms with the anti-slavery campaign, the British were able to exempt the 'self-governing' settlers in South Africa from the operations of the Brussels Act. By this device also, while constantly fighting African states and negotiating various treaties and conventions with African rulers, they could pretend that, by owning slaves and dealing in slaves, African states enjoyed no recognition in international law. It was thus possible to pretend in the General Act of the Berlin Conference of 1885 and the Brussels Act of 1889 that in international law Africa was a terra nullius and only European powers and settlers had interests there that had to be protected."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.629, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 369, 'article_title': 'THE ASHANTEE WAR.', 'full_section_title': 'THE ASHANTEE WAR.', 'last_edit_date': '05-12-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1864#article-7', 'issue_date': '23_06_1864', 'content': 'Sir,—In the impossibility of any present advance into Ashantee, Prahsoo, lately head-quarters of the expeditionary force, is now a detachment station.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it.

This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.726, 'probability_score': 0.07, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CLIMATE OF WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Sir,—As you have so kindly drawn attention to the health of the Navy on the West Coast of Africa, may I be permitted to say a word on behalf of the officers of the West India regiments quartered in that pestilential climate?  \nThe 4th West India Regiment has been on the Coast barely three years, during which period they have lost no less than 19 or 20 officers, and many more than that number invalided, a great number of whom have been obliged, through ill-health, to exchange, go on half-pay, or leave the service altogether.  \nThe 3rd West India Regiment, lately sent to Jamaica, lost a great many officers, but I am not positive as to the exact number.

The mortality and sickness has occurred only since the end of February, with few exceptions. The local error committed we deem to have been this: The rains commenced two months before their time. We think that on the very first day of rain, all idea of further duty in the field should have been abandoned, and nearly all the troops have been ordered back to Cape Coast Castle without delay. When once the rains began, no troops could go into Ashantee, and no Ashantees would come into the Territories. Again, the campaign being over, we think the Tamar's men, who would otherwise have been marched up to camp immediately, where there were rations, &c., for fifty or sixty days, ought not to have been landed, there being no adequate accommodation for them.

Who does not recall to mind what made Lagos so fatally pestilential—who does not observe causes similar to those which led to the mortality in the Bristol, and to the late fever outbreak at Bathurst, Gambia? This question of the asserted deadly character of the climate of the West Coast of Africa over and above that of all other tropical or semi-tropical countries, is all-important in our eyes. As in the case of Bermuda, we cannot allow culpable official indifference and neglect at head-quarters—red-tape stupidity with obstinate ignorance in naval and military commanders—and carelessness and inefficiency in governors to decide this question for us! We believe that the West Coast countries contain what, considering their proximity to England, will necessarily make them to rank eventually among the most important possessions of the British Crown; and we cannot silently view our hold on any portion of them relaxed, because of a fever myth sedulously propagated by guilty and interested parties. The climate and the at present social influences are, no doubt, prejudicial to the health of Europeans, but by no means necessarily fatal.

This last gave as his opinion, ""that a few thousands spent at Cameroons or Fernando Po would, calculating only the market value of seamen\'s lives, repay themselves in as many years."" But the pros and cons of that lofty range as a sanitarium must be considered, and officers on the Coast should be consulted before the Home Government attempt to spend a large amount on it. There are many advantages in its favour, as may be seen described in the work of Captain Burton, on ""Abeokuta and the Cameroons,"" but there are also some great disadvantages attaching to it as a military sanitarium.\n\nIts distance from the different military stations on the Coast is one great objection, as it is situated about 400 miles below the last—viz., Lagos. It will be no great consolation for a sick officer—laid up, perhaps, with intractable fever, debility, diarrhœa, or dysentery, to be ordered, say, from the Gambia or Sierra Leone, to the Cameroons Mountains, a distance of about 2,000 miles, in a steam-packet, which is most uncomfortable, and unadapted for the conveyance of the sick during a voyage of eighteen days, in a direction quite opposite to the accustomed route—viz., to Teneriffe, Madeira, or England.

We saw in the African Times of May 23rd, 1873, that Mr. Quin and others had an interview with the Earl of Kimberley about the affairs on the West Coast, but we were surprised to see that the Administrator, O\'Callaghan, ""had been compelled by ill health to resign."" We admit that Colonel Anton\'s health was totally ruined, which was the cause of his death; but if the life he led there had been closely watched, the authorities would not have come to the conclusion that he was affected by the climate. When the Administrator arrived here and saw the defenceless state of the Gambia, he thought of organizing a kind of Volunteer force; but this was without success. In fact, Mrs. O\'Callaghan was so very much dissatisfied and frightened at the place, that she would be extremely alarmed on hearing the report of a gun, and even the rumbling of carriage wheels. We were very much dissatisfied when we heard that his Excellency, who was stouter than when he entered the Gambia, was ordered home because of ill health, not knowing that he was looking out for another post. He even promised that he would report the state of the settlement on his arrival in England, that measures might be taken to rectify every defect in the place. We could show many instances to prove that our climate is not so unhealthy that Europeans could not live twenty-eight, thirty, forty-four, and even fifty-five years in it. Messrs. Goddard, Brown, Robertson, Chown, Quin, and Chief Justice Mantell are living testimonies of this settlement. The first of these gentlemen was a merchant who amassed a fortune; he lived in Bathurst a period of about fifty-five years, returned home, and died at the age of seventy-eight. The second, who is now in Bathurst, carrying on an extensive business, has been here for forty-four years, and his health, we venture to say, is improving every day. The third, who was the Colonial Surgeon and afterwards Secretary, resided in this settlement for thirty years, and has now retired to Scotland. The fourth, who was a merchant, took a residence in this place for twenty-five years, and returned home with a fortune. The fifth was of the same calling, resided here for the space of twenty-two years, made his fortune, and has taken his abode in England. The Chief Justice, also, stationed in this colony for twenty-eight years, is now holding a situation as a magistrate in England. Lawyer Montague, Smith and others are living testimonies of ""unhealthy"" Sierra Leone.

A few years ago the chiefs of the district formed a rival society for exterminating those cannibals, but innocent persons having been murdered through false denunciations, the English authorities put it down.

The articles describe the inadequate bamboo sheds that failed to protect troops from the damp weather and pestiferous swamps, leading to high rates of illness, including dysentery and fever. The lack of fresh provisions and reliance on salt beef and pork further weakened the troops' health.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths. From 50 to 80 per cent have or have had syphilis or yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm,"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.568, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A fragile population emerging from near stability', 'content': 'This picture is not in any way surprising.

Given the mortality levels described above (which is a conservative assumption in view of the fact that the health conditions of the forests of the west coast equatorial area have probably long been worse than elsewhere), the conclu› sion could be drawn that in the centuries past those areas averaging 5 births per woman had experienced population declines averaging over 0.5 per cent per annum, and those averaging 3.5 children declines of over 1.5 per cent per annum. This is inconceivable over any protracted period; the latter population would be halving every forty years, and both situations suggest much larger populations during the earlier years of European contact than has ever been suggested.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.56, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy of the former French, Belgian and Portuguese zones, 1914-35', 'section_title': ""The workers' burden > The crises and their repercussions > Food shortage, famine and epidemic"", 'content': ""Taken all round, however, the catastrophe was less spectacular.

But the fall in prices and loss of employment were everywhere cruelly felt. 'It was in the price paid to the producer that the decline made itself most heavily felt. The purchasing power of the natives was reduced to a greater extent than in any of the earlier crises.' 48 It is revealing that, in Francophone Africa, large-scale urban immigration began precisely when the great crisis occurred. Notwithstanding the overall stagnation in population growth (in AOF 14.4 million inhabitants in 1931, as compared with 14.6 million in 1936), the towns and cities began to be swollen by the massive influx of destitute peasants, in spite of the fact that the urban employment situation was also critical. In 1936, for example, there were still no more than 167000 wage-earners in AOF, which was hardly more than 1% of the population. Nevertheless, between 1931 and 1936 the populations of Dakar and Abidjan increased by 71%, while that of Conakry doubled. Even more revealing is the case of an impoverished little town in the interior like Ouagadougou which, reversing its previous trend, increased its population by one-third over the same period. The overall stagnation in population growth during this period is parti› cularly indicative of the prevailing state of poverty. For social expenditure, was, by contrast, tending everywhere to rise: the parallel increase in ex› penditure on health care, and in the number of dispensaries and treatment facilities tended effectively to curb the traditional scourges (trypanoso› miasis, venereal diseases, leprosy). By contrast, populations proved to be particularly vulnerable during the taxing period 1931-6 to epidemics ('sporadic illnesses': influenza, smallpox, etc.). It is extremely tempting to relate such increased morbidity to the state of profound distress and physical destitution in which a weakened and defenceless population found itself. 49"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.571, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'The Maasai', 'content': 'It can be said, therefore, that the effect of the long series of wars was to eliminate the powerful Maasai groups, especially on the northern plateaux. Their survivors were widely scattered as a result of the wars: from the Kilimanjaro lowlands to Taveta, down the Pare and Shambaa plains in the Pangani valley, from Arusha down to the southern Maasai Steppe towards the coast. These were the groups which came to be known as Iloikop or Wa-Kwavi in the existing literature on the Maasai.

Certainly the land occupied by them was also reduced as a result of the wars. They no longer inhabited the regions east of Mount Kilimanjaro and the Uasin Gishu and Laikipia plateaux. Most of the Rift Valley, plains and open plateaux alike remained under their control but with a greatly reduced population. What finally affected the power of the pastoral Maasai severely were the human and animal diseases that infected the region after the prolonged wars. The large areas covered in the raids brought the Maasai into contact with many other groups and made it possible for infectious and unaccustomed diseases to be passed on from other groups. In 1869, for example, the Maasai lost a large number of people from cholera contracted from the Samburu.$^{46}$ The worst scourge came in the 1880s when a serious outbreak of smallpox coincided with a pleuro-pneumonia epidemic that decimated Maasai herds.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered.

By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.57, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A fragile population emerging from near stability', 'content': ""The main aim here will be to examine those influences which may have caused long-term population change as well as those which may have had more dramatic short-term effects within the last century. It is commonly assumed that the major constraint on population numbers in traditional societies has been the availability of food. However, E. Boserup has argued that critical population densities do not lead to a Malthusian situation but to changes in the methods of cultivation: 'the low rates of population growth found (until recently) in pre-industrial communities cannot be explained as the result of insufficient food supplies due to overpopulation, and we must leave room for other factors in the explanation of demographic trends ... medical, biological, political, etc.'$^{22}$ The African past may well have been more complex than this and the ultimate bounds may have been those of food resources, even though infrequently brought into play. The land available for farming was that land not proscribed by other uses; for instance, the nearly deserted land between warring kingdoms had alternative employment as a no-man's land. In much of the continent little land appeared to be in use at any one time, either because slash-and-burn or savanna shifting cultivation meant that most land at any given time was fallow or because hunters and food gatherers needed huge areas for their support. Only occasionally did extreme famine conditions strike, caused by drought or locusts or by the disorganization arising from war or epidemic. The crisis was usually too sudden to allow any substantial temporary invasion of the fallow,$^{23}$ and in effect the limits of the carrying capacity of the land were reached with resulting huge mortality and a drop in population numbers for decades. The pressure on the capacity of the system to produce food was usually - but not always - too short and sudden to produce the successive changes in methods of land use that Boserup describes. Such changes are most likely when population numbers push persistently against the food-producing capacity of the cultivation system either in a situation where the great peaks of mortality have been reduced by health measures or other actions or where luck or geographical conditions moderate those peaks. For decades subsequent to the crisis, populations remained well below the level at which they pressed on food supplies;$^{24}$ they grew, but only at a modest rate, because they were still subject to the ravages of fearful diseases.

It is constructed at the base of a gradual descent; so that when, as of late, it rains very heavily, all around the camp is something like a mud swamp. The bush having been only so lately cleared, the earth which has thus become exposed cannot be expected to exhale anything else but malaria, and therefore it will be contrary to all the rules of hygiene to expect the camp at Prahsoo to be healthy. Its close proximity to the river, although pleasant, tends, of course, to increase the dampness of the encampment. The contrast between the atmosphere during the day and night is too sudden for health, the variation being more than 20 degrees. Whilst the excitement lasted there was very little sickness, but after a residence of sixteen days one, and another, and another, became so dreadfully ill, that the medical officer in charge was obliged to invalid them to the seacoast; so that within eight weeks of their arrival in the bush nearly the whole of the officers left the Prah for Cape Coast in a dreadful state. The troops arrived at the Prah about the 1st February, and on the 8th April, when the Tamar anchored in Cape Coast roadstead, there were fourteen officers of the 4th West at the Castle; and such was their state of health, that at the dinner given to *fête* the arrival of the reinforcement, only one was able to leave his bed and meet them, and even he was in a dreadful state of debility. Out of twenty-six officers who left the Coast for the field, fifteen, or thereabout, have been invalided home, in a very precarious state, three have died, and four are still obliged to keep their bed, though not sufficiently ill to be invalided. Of the soldiers many have died, principally from dysentery. A great many are so weak, that, in all probability, they will not be fit for active service in the field for the next twelve months. Of the twelve medical officers on the Coast, three have been invalided, one has died, and three are still prostrated with fever. Of the soldiers of the detachment of the 1st West India Regiment sent up to Prahsoo on the 24th April, we gather from the report of the medical officer in charge that seventeen were admitted into hospital within three days of their arrival in the camp, and that an average of twenty were daily reported sick. Such, then, is the present position of the troops on the Gold Coast. It is dreadful to both Africans and Europeans; and should the Government intend to have it supplied with troops from the West Indies, it must be prepared to find means of properly rationing them with fresh provisions.

The roads to it are in many parts covered with swamps and pools of stagnant water, which during the heavy rains present great obstruction to travellers. The camp, in its present condition, on account of the frequent heavy rains which we have had, is nearly under water, with the exception of a few elevated spots. Two days of sunshine after this inundation convert the pools into muddy, pestiferous swamps, breeding that baneful poison which produces the most deleterious effects on the constitution. All the unoccupied ground of the camp is now covered with alga and fungi, emitting the most stinking and deadly vapour, especially when the morning sun falls upon it. The temporary bamboo sheds built by the forces, to be occupied only during the short period they were expected to remain here before they crossed over the Ashantee frontier, on active operations, are, I contend, perfectly insufficient to shelter them from the effects of those pestiferous swamps and of the damp weather of the rainy season. It is therefore no wonder that Prahsoo should now have become a great hospital, instead of a place where officers and men are expected to be in an efficient state to oppose an enemy who will never cross the river, swollen as it is at this season. Even the huts are surrounded by swamps, which defy all the attempts of Lieutenant Roberts at drainage, and through the roofs of most of them the rain pours down as through a sieve. They are consequently wet and most unhealthy. The result is what might be expected; out of a force of 200 men of the 1st West India Regiment who arrived here about the 1st of the month (Tamar troops), there were no less than nineteen admitted to hospital during the first week; whilst the first week of the force of 300 men of the 4th West India Regiment who arrived here before the rains only gave twelve to hospital; there is therefore a difference of seven. This difference gradually increased, and we find in the second week the admittance of the 1st West was twenty-nine, whilst that of the 4th at the former period in the second week was only eighteen. In the third week the proportion was still greater; the admittance in the 4th West in their third week had been only fourteen, whilst the effect of the continuous rains and the consequent pernicious change of the sanitary condition of the camp has been such as to cause the admission of one out of every four men in the camp into hospital—viz., fifty-three—showing that during the first three weeks, of the 300 men of the 4th West India Regiment before the rains there were only forty-four admittances, whilst during the same period, but in a different season, of the 200 men of the 1st West India Regiment there were 101 admitted into hospital.'}]","[{'document_title': 'THE ASHANTEE WAR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'From the position of Prahsoo, it is self-evident that it must be unhealthy, at least for some time to come; and the position of the camp is such as to secure for its inmates the maximum of unhealthiness in the district. It is constructed at the base of a gradual descent; so that when, as of late, it rains very heavily, all around the camp is something like a mud swamp. The bush having been only so lately cleared, the earth which has thus become exposed cannot be expected to exhale anything else but malaria, and therefore it will be contrary to all the rules of hygiene to expect the camp at Prahsoo to be healthy. Its close proximity to the river, although pleasant, tends, of course, to increase the dampness of the encampment. The contrast between the atmosphere during the day and night is too sudden for health, the variation being more than 20 degrees. Whilst the excitement lasted there was very little sickness, but after a residence of sixteen days one, and another, and another, became so dreadfully ill, that the medical officer in charge was obliged to invalid them to the seacoast; so that within eight weeks of their arrival in the bush nearly the whole of the officers left the Prah for Cape Coast in a dreadful state. The troops arrived at the Prah about the 1st February, and on the 8th April, when the Tamar anchored in Cape Coast roadstead, there were fourteen officers of the 4th West at the Castle; and such was their state of health, that at the dinner given to *fête* the arrival of the reinforcement, only one was able to leave his bed and meet them, and even he was in a dreadful state of debility. Out of twenty-six officers who left the Coast for the field, fifteen, or thereabout, have been invalided home, in a very precarious state, three have died, and four are still obliged to keep their bed, though not sufficiently ill to be invalided. Of the soldiers many have died, principally from dysentery. A great many are so weak, that, in all probability, they will not be fit for active service in the field for the next twelve months. Of the twelve medical officers on the Coast, three have been invalided, one has died, and three are still prostrated with fever. Of the soldiers of the detachment of the 1st West India Regiment sent up to Prahsoo on the 24th April, we gather from the report of the medical officer in charge that seventeen were admitted into hospital within three days of their arrival in the camp, and that an average of twenty were daily reported sick. Such, then, is the present position of the troops on the Gold Coast. It is dreadful to both Africans and Europeans; and should the Government intend to have it supplied with troops from the West Indies, it must be prepared to find means of properly rationing them with fresh provisions. It is a great pity to bring a lot of men here to sacrifice their lives; and whenever a lasting peace is proclaimed between our Government and the King of Ashantee, I think it will not be an imprudent act to have the Coast supplied, according to the recommendation of Sir Benjamin Pine, with a strong police constabulary and a small detachment of only about 100 men.

Mr. Hackett can do nothing; he is not a favourite with any one, and a more incapable man could not have been selected. Time will show the result of this false step. There are loud expressions of regret that Governor Pine should have relinquished the reins of government at this extreme crisis; and, I dare say, none feel it so much as poor Colonel Conran, who is nearly worked to death. For such a fearful mortality as at present was, I believe, never known in this place.

I have been informed that Dr. Horton, the medical officer in charge at Prahsoo, wrote a strong letter on the sanitary condition of that camp, recommending the withdrawal of the troops until after the rains. My informant told me that Colonel Conran was unable to do so, although he saw how desirable and necessary such a step is, because his Excellency Governor Pine, when embarking, left strict orders to Judge Hackett, the Lieut.-Governor, that the Ashantee frontiers were to be guarded, and the troops were not to be withdrawn, and he, the Judge, consequently refused to permit the withdrawal. I am exceedingly sorry that Governor Pine is away, as I am certain that the troops would long ago have been removed.

But no; the health of the forces was good from August, 1863, until some three weeks after they had marched in several directions into the bush of the interior. The mortality and sickness has occurred only since the end of February, with few exceptions. The local error committed we deem to have been this: The rains commenced two months before their time. We think that on the very first day of rain, all idea of further duty in the field should have been abandoned, and nearly all the troops have been ordered back to Cape Coast Castle without delay. When once the rains began, no troops could go into Ashantee, and no Ashantees would come into the Territories. Again, the campaign being over, we think the Tamar's men, who would otherwise have been marched up to camp immediately, where there were rations, &c., for fifty or sixty days, ought not to have been landed, there being no adequate accommodation for them. But the great sickness and death was not among these men, but among those who had been at Prahsoo and other up-country stations.\n\nWe hope that now the party battle has been fought, men will reason calmly about events which, though deplorable, have not the gravity that has been attributed to them. We never hear it said, when some regiment in India has been sent on necessary service, and the cholera has decimated it, that Government or the authorities deserve impeachment for sending men on such an expedition. And why should the case be different in Africa? We know, by news from the camp itself, that all necessary medicines and medical comforts were there. But the exhalations of a lately uncovered soil were poisonous; as also the water, which no attempt seems to have been made to purify, though sand was abundant, and charcoal enough might have been burned in a few days to form a filter bed for an army, instead of for a mere battalion. It must be acknowledged that the absence of inventive resources to meet emergencies in campaign, which peculiarly characterises our troops, greatly increases the difficulties of Government, and leads frequently to disease and death that might have been very easily averted."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1864#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.07, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE ASHANTEE WAR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—In the impossibility of any present advance into Ashantee, Prahsoo, lately head-quarters of the expeditionary force, is now a detachment station.

She brought out 300 men of the 1st West India Regiment and the left wing of the 4th, about 400 strong.

It might be worth while for officers to provide themselves with a small respirator, to be worn when exposed to the night air.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'West Coast Climate—Yellow Fever—Army and Navy Mismanagement', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Why, this is worse than the ill-fated encampment in the bush at Prahsu, during the so-called Ashantee campaign—a mortality there which led to the assembly of a Parliamentary committee, and the all but abandonment by us of the Protected Territories on the Gold Coast, and other West African colonies and settlements. And who does not see in the above short extracts similar causes to those which made Cape Coast so unhealthy a station, before Colonel Conran took the fever bull by the horns and restrained him by sanitary improvements; which, if adhered to and perfected as they ought to be, will reflect lasting honour on his Cape Coast rule, however seriously he may have erred in other important matters? Who does not recall to mind what made Lagos so fatally pestilential—who does not observe causes similar to those which led to the mortality in the Bristol, and to the late fever outbreak at Bathurst, Gambia? This question of the asserted deadly character of the climate of the West Coast of Africa over and above that of all other tropical or semi-tropical countries, is all-important in our eyes. As in the case of Bermuda, we cannot allow culpable official indifference and neglect at head-quarters—red-tape stupidity with obstinate ignorance in naval and military commanders—and carelessness and inefficiency in governors to decide this question for us! We believe that the West Coast countries contain what, considering their proximity to England, will necessarily make them to rank eventually among the most important possessions of the British Crown; and we cannot silently view our hold on any portion of them relaxed, because of a fever myth sedulously propagated by guilty and interested parties. The climate and the at present social influences are, no doubt, prejudicial to the health of Europeans, but by no means necessarily fatal.

Bristol, or the Gambia—and will direct their efforts to a just and humane economy of health and life, by more frequent naval reliefs, and such sanitary measures on land as it is a disgrace to the British name to neglect merely because they would or might involve some slight official inconvenience, or increase of Imperial expenditure, which ought not to be allowed to weigh against all-valuable human life, we should soon cease to hear such diatribes as have lately been directed against the climate of the West Coast of Africa, whose fevers are certainly not worse than the jungle fever* of the East Indies; and energies would soon be brought into play which would within a very few years raise the exports of those West countries to England from their present two millions to ten millions of annual value, paid for in great part by British manufactures which the natives so ardently covet.

While the textbook focuses primarily on health and mortality, The African Times articles expand on this by detailing the prevalence of fever, dysentery, and other diseases, often worsened by inadequate sanitary measures and poor living conditions. The articles also emphasize the psychological toll on morale due to constant sickness and the loss of comrades, while acknowledging that not all deaths were solely due to the climate. Factors such as poor personal care, excessive alcohol consumption, and lack of acclimatization are also mentioned, suggesting that with proper precautions, Europeans could potentially maintain their health.

These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel.

The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals.

At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities.

So scarce were these resources, and so widespread the revolts in certain areas such as French West Africa and Libya that the reimposition of European control over the revolted areas had to be delayed until troops became available. Large areas of Haut-SØnØgal-Niger and Dahomey remained out of French control for as long as a year for lack of troops.

In certain instances Africans were specially trained, as in Senegal, to fill the vacancies thus created.$^{20}$ In British West Africa, others jobs hitherto reserved for whites were filled by educated Africans which, as Richard Rathbone has pointed out, goes some way towards explaining the loyalty of the elites during the war.$^{21}$ In French West Africa, the governor-general complained that the British, who were not subjected to general mobilization in their colonies, were taking advantage of the fact that their French allies were, by filling the trading vacuum left by the departure of French commercial agents to the front.$^{22}$ Only in Egypt was there a net increase in the European presence, since there was an enormous influx of British troops using Egypt as a base for the Allied offensive in the Middle East."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The First World War and its consequences', 'section_title': 'The African involvement in the War', 'content': ""Compulsory recruitment was also used to raise troops and carriers in British East Africa, under the compulsory service order of 1915, which made all males aged between 18 and 45 liable for military service.

Neither the desert dwellers nor the highlanders could take much time off from their orchard farming and stock-rearing; and this allowed the invader to launch real economic warfare against them. During the Adrar campaign in 1909 the French soldiers occupied the oases at the time of the date harvest and waited for the men to be compelled by hunger to come and surrender (admittedly not for long). In areas where seasonal migration with stock took place, they closed off the winter pastures and relied on cold and hunger to bring the inhabitants to terms.

Campaigns were fought on African soil which - though they only marginally affected the overall course of war - had significant implications for Africa. More than a million African soldiers were involved in these campaigns or campaigns in Europe. Even more men, as well as women and children, were recruited, often forcibly, as carriers to support armies whose supplies could not be moved by conventional methods such as road, rail or packanimal. Over 150000 soldiers and carriers lost their lives during the war. Many more were wounded and disabled. By the time the war ended, every country in Africa, with the exception of the small Spanish territories which remained neutral - had been formally committed to one side or the other. Belgian, British, French, Italian and Portuguese administrations were allied - more or less actively - against German colonies (see Fig. 2.1). Even the last remaining independent states on the continent - Liberia, Ethiopia and Därfür - became involved. Liberia declared for the Allies on the entry of the United States into the war in 1917. The pro-Muslim boy-Emperor of Ethiopia, Lij Iyasu, proclaimed his country's allegiance to Turkey, thereby causing considerable concern among the Allies that he would inspire a djihäd among the Muslims of the Horn of Africa where Sayyid Muhammad Abdule Hasan's forces were still giving trouble to the British.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well.

Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi. It was not until after the Second World War that technical schools and univer› sity colleges were established in most parts of Africa. And significantly, only one university college each was established in the Gold Coast in 1947, in Nigeria in 1948, in Uganda in 1950, in Senegal and Madagascar in 1950, in Salisbury in 1953, in Congo Leopoldville in 1954 and Elizabethville in 1956.

Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

Cre› ativity became especially necessary where a small number of Europeans lived among a large number of Africans as was the case in many colonies of exploitation such as Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Saint-Domingue. Where the European population failed to comprise a critical mass, the Africans had to build a society from a diverse collectivity of individuals who had little more in common than their skin colour and their servility. The adoption of their customs and behaviour by the non-African sector indicated the measure of their success.\nAfricans did not always conform to the society into which they were thrust. For centuries marronage, or the flight from the slave system, existed as an integral aspect of slavery.$^{53}$ In Brazil, the north-east witnessed the establishment of the quilombo of Palmares which lasted almost a century and which was eliminated only with the largest military force ever mounted in the Americas by the Portuguese and Brazilians.

Six months at home for the officers who have endured this, might without impropriety, and ought to be granted; and the officers now in the bush, after they have served their four or eight weeks there, will find themselves perfectly unfit for the campaign, unless a trip to a more genial climate is previously granted to them. The River Prah has risen about twelve feet since the troops have been up there. Several canoes have been placed in it for the use of the officers and for recreation, and I can assure you it has been found delightful to row up and down the river. The scenery, although in many places monotonous, is also in many others grand and picturesque. The evening is the best time for rowing, and when the boat is quietly moving down with the stream, the first thing that strikes one is the excessive sinuosity of the river, which makes very peculiar turns. Large blocks of wood are seen on either side of the river, and occasionally a stray tree lies almost across it, impeding the navigation. Sometimes an alligator, but more generally a fish, may be seen springing on to the neighbouring bank, and some of the latter have even leaped into the boats, causing a pretty scrimmage for a moment among the crews. The banks, from a little above the water's edge, are covered with *Cyperaceous glumifera*; and hosts of kingfishers, with their spotted wings, hover overhead. The beautiful golden variety is also numerous; they are so small as to resemble the honey sucker, with its bright red beak. The white flower of the lily shows conspicuous above the dense collection of evergreen grasses. The forest, which gives a peculiar charm to all tropical bush, is here very charming. The leaves of the forest trees have a great variety of hues; openings in the bush disclose here a turf of light green slightly sprinkled with dark blue, there of deep green, displayed to perfection by the setting sun, which penetrates through the interstices among blue, green, brown, bright and delicate red leaves. Add to this the noise of the gay parrots crossing and recrossing the river far above the head of the beholder, and you will admit that the River Prah has its charms; but, like every other thing, it loses these when too constantly seen, and necessarily fails to divert the mind from the painful thoughts which the attendant unhealthiness in the camp, where brave men sicken and die, without any seemingly useful result, is so calculated to produce.""}, {'id': 388, 'article_title': 'PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE.', 'full_section_title': 'PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1864#article-26', 'issue_date': '23_06_1864', 'content': '\n\nLord A. Churchill wished to express his heartfelt sympathy with the hon. baronet in the death of his brother, and also with the families of the officers who had fallen in this strife. It appeared that the differences arose from the King of Ashantee demanding the giving up, under an extradition treaty, of an alleged offender, which Governor Pine refused to do unless evidence of his guilt were supplied, upon which the King of Ashantee threatened the invasion of our territory, and in the spring of last year he invaded the Protected Territories, and the Fantees were obliged to turn out in great force to meet the invasion. Major Cochrane was sent with an auxiliary force, but he failed in his support, and in consequence the Ashantees overran the whole territory, massacred 4,000 or 5,000 Fantees, and then retired, and it was to prevent the recurrence of such an event that Governor Pine applied to the Duke of Newcastle. In reply, his grace stated that he had considered the plans submitted to him, but he declined to give his adherence to them, and he enjoined upon the Governor that the principle of all military proceedings on that coast should be that of defence, and not that of aggression, and that on that principle alone were governors entitled to make war; but ultimately Governor Pine was authorized to strike a blow against the Ashantees, if it could be done consistently with the safety of the troops. The Duke of Newcastle had shown the utmost desire that the troops should be cared for in every way—(hear, hear)—and to inveigh against the Government for culpable negligence was to make a charge which could not be sustained. Stores of various kinds calculated to serve for a long time were gathered together, and the disasters which had occurred might be attributed to the two facts that the Tamar, which conveyed the troops, had arrived a month later than was anticipated, and that the wet season set in a month earlier than usual. The delay of the vessel was not remarkable when it was remembered that the troops sent from the West Indies had to be collected from different islands, and that the ship had to make her way in the face of the trade winds. He did not think, therefore, that there was anything very unusual in arriving a month after the time expected. As to the troops being located near Cape Coast Castle, it seemed that was one of the healthiest stations on the Coast. The principal charge seemed to be that thirteen officers had died. But when this was stated, the nature of the climate must be considered, as well as the fact that all persons who went there, including the black troops, had to pass through a period of acclimatisation. This return of the deaths of officers, it must be borne in mind, extended over the whole year. He would also remind the House that officers in the line, who were anxious for rapid promotion, often exchanged into West India Regiments, and he had made the attempt himself; but if they did so they acted with the knowledge that they were exposing themselves to a climate most deleterious to health. He rather regretted the precipitate manner in which the Colonial-office had written to remove the depot at the Castle, and this not for any ulterior design of invading the territory of Ashantee, but for the purpose of ensuring the safety of those under our protection. He wished more efforts had been made to construct roads, which would not only have been valuable in a military point of view, but which would also be useful in the furtherance of commerce, and this might have been done at a trifling cost, probably at 35l. per mile. The Ashantees received a large portion of their supplies by the river Volta, one part of which formed a part of our territories, and the other part belonged to the Ashantees. That could be readily blockaded and supplies be thus cut off. Large quantities of arms, ammunition, and other munitions of war were obtained by the Ashantees through the Dutch settlements also. It was quite possible by certain arrangements to put an end to this kind of traffic. With regard to our army surgeons, two of the most competent, who were sent out with our troops, were coloured surgeons, natives of Africa, and who had been educated in the British medical schools. It appeared that they were the only two surgeons who had never been attacked with fever, or the other diseases incidental to the country. He thought that this was an important fact, which proved that if we were to maintain troops in that part of the world it was most essential to employ coloured surgeons to remain with them.

Major Goldsworthy was too ill to attend. The Mayor, after a speech full of high and deserved eulogy, proposed the healths of Captain Glover, Captain Sartorius, Captain Larcom, Lieutenant Cameron, and Lieutenant Barnard.\n\nThe following is a condensed report of Captain Glover's speech on returning thanks:—""}, {'id': 4256, 'article_title': 'Imperial Parliament', 'full_section_title': 'Imperial Parliament', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1881#article-15', 'issue_date': '01_07_1881', 'content': ""Mr. CHILDERS: In reply to my hon. friend's first question, I can only refer him to the very full answer I gave to the hon. and gallant member for Thirsk on the same subject on Friday.

In reply to his second question, I have to say that one officer has died, and twenty-one out of fifty-five have been invalided. The troops were put under canvas as soon as possible, and the invaliding thence has been much less than in the hired houses. As to responsibility, I cannot attribute blame to any one, as, unfortunately, the King of Ashanti threatened war at the most pestilential season, and but for the prompt measures taken we should probably have been at war with him now.

The wisdom of this precautionary measure was soon proved, as two ambushes had been prepared on the flanks, which were not dislodged before a soldier of the 2nd West was wounded. After two hours' fatiguing march through high grass and brushwood Jalliah was sighted. Gbow had cleared the bush for about 800 yards round the outer stockade, which was a very formidable one, and well deserved its reputation for strength. The fences of the outer stockade were twelve feet high, and planted at intervals of a few inches, the piles being of great thickness, and closely interlaced, top and bottom, with pliant ligneous shrubs, making for native warfare an almost irresistible chevaux de frise. There were two inner stockades, and Gbow had under his command about 2,000 warriors. The engagement began in the open, and the police were thrown out as skirmishers, supported by the soldiers, our allies attacking the flanks. The enemy after a short resistance retired behind the stockade.\n\nIt was now nearly midday, the heat excessive, and the condition of officers and men was pitiable in the extreme. Captain Skelton fainted, and Surgeon-Major Parke stated that it was hotter than he had ever known it in the Red Sea. The West India soldiers preferred standing exposed to the enemy's fire rather than lie down on the parched ground. The order to advance was given, and by a succession of rushes our men were taken to within sixty yards of the stockade, and poured in a most telling fire. The allies on the flanks behaved with the utmost gallantry, clambering up the stockades only to be repulsed by the fire and spear thrusts of the enemy.

Owing undoubtedly to a soldier-like desire on his part that as little as possible should be made of his illness, only the scantiest of information had reached the public relative to the attack of fever which obliged the Prince to return from the front. Moreover, his journey to the coast seemed to indicate that his strength was being maintained, and when he was taken on board the Blonde, though weak, he did not display any very grave symptoms. But the tidings received from Sierra Leone a few days later showed that all the best hopes had been falsified, for the Prince had died on board on his way to Madeira. It is a national grief that his gallant desire to serve the State has led to an untimely death. In their dark hour of bereavement the Queen and Princess Beatrice are assured that throughout the kingdom all hearts beat in profound sympathy with their sorrow. England will not forget that Prince Henry of Battenberg laid down his life in her cause; that he volunteered for active service, and refused to have the rough places made smoother for him than for his comrades. As an example of his appreciation of the risks of a West African campaign, just before embarking on leaving England he replied to a question as to whether fighting was probable by saying that he thought the principal enemy of the troops would be the climate. His end is a mournful sequel to the intelligence that the object of the expedition had been quickly and successfully achieved, and that King Prempeh had submitted without firing a shot. The soldier blood ran strongly in Prince Henry's veins, and though he had not the opportunity to establish a great reputation on the battlefield, he has fallen a victim to fever contracted in the path of military duty. Now that more details of the course of the fatal fever have been obtained, it is evident that the brief reports of its earlier stages conveyed no idea of the severity of the attack. He was within thirty miles of Coomassie when seized with illness, and by the time he had been taken back to Prahsu his condition was extremely grave. While the stage from that place to the coast was being traversed the Prince rallied, but a relapse set in, sudden and unexpected, and the insidious West Coast climate had done its work beyond remedy. The little war in Ashanti has proved a military promenade, but it has demanded its death-roll none the less. It is melancholy, indeed, that the solution of the troubles which have so long oppressed the Colony on the coast has had to be bought at the price of gallant lives. A gloom has been cast over the whole campaign, which clouds the satisfaction at the measures necessary to put a stop to the constant menace of a hinterland in seething unrest having been carried out. It is less than a decade since Prince Henry was married to Princess Beatrice, and in the years that have passed he has steadily advanced in the regard of the nation.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Medical Remarks re the African Climate and the Ashanti War', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The *Medical Times and Gazette* says: ""The first batch of invalids resulting from the \'little war\' forced upon us by the King of Ashanti have just reached this country in the Himalaya, and have been transferred to Haslar Hospital.

The head-quarters of the 2nd West India Regiment were only disembarked at Cape Coast on July 11 last; but although from the nature of their constant duties in the tropics, they might have been expected to be somewhat acclimatized; they speedily began to suffer from the prevailing forms of fever and dysentery. Many of the officers were attacked; the colonel of the regiment has come home in the Himalaya invalided, and the adjutant died a few days before the news left.\n\nA correspondent writes to the *Pall Mall Gazette*: ""The invalids from the West Coast of Africa state that dysentery and fever were engendered by the supply of bad water and defective salt provisions.

It might be worth while for officers to provide themselves with a small respirator, to be worn when exposed to the night air. These are now being procured of very small size, and capable of being worn inside the lips, so as to be invisible.

The want of proper sanitary measures is another reason why the climate of West Africa proves fatal to many European constitutions. When streets and yards, both back and front of houses, are made the receptacles of filth and excrement, of putrified remains of dead dogs, cats, and other animal and vegetable matter, is it to be wondered at that the miasma rising from these dung-heaps eventually becomes fatal to those constantly inhaling it. This is a cause which it would be well for the colonial authorities here to take into their serious consideration, as it is most certainly a preventible one. It was only in 1871, during the administration of Mr. J. Pope Hennessy, that the sanitary condition of Freetown seriously occupied the attention of the Government; but whether that gentleman’s plans have ever been efficiently carried out, and what effects they have hitherto had there, we have no means here to ascertain.\n\n3. The Europeans on the West Coast of Africa, unlike their countrymen in India, South America, and elsewhere, perhaps for the reasons I have already stated, are so careless of their personal comfort, and so intent upon accumulating as much money as they can, that they deny themselves every convenience necessary in a tropical climate. In Sierra Leone, for instance, they live in the town, which is at the sea-shore, instead of on the mountains, where they would enjoy the sea breezes equally as well, and be in a cooler and healthier atmosphere. In support of this view, I will only quote a passage which occurs in a paper read by Mr. Hennessy before the Society of Arts in April, 1873, in which he says: “The mountain district (of Sierra Leone), according to the Registrar-General’s Returns, appears to be as healthy as any part of England, or indeed as Madeira, the climate of which it closely resembles.”\n\nI hope I have clearly shown that the large mortality on the West Coast of Africa is not entirely due to climatic influences, and that a great deal could be done by the Government and the Europeans to counteract and mitigate those influences. As living proofs of what I have stated, I beg to point out Mr. Magnus Smith, Mr. A. Montagu, Mr. Marston, and half-a-dozen others, who have resided in Sierra Leone for fifteen or twenty years without meeting with the same fate as their countrymen, and simply because they have known how to live.—I am, dear Sir,', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE CLIMATE OF THE GOLD COAST', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following is taken from an article from the pen of Dr. J. A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2. Avoid getting chilled by standing or sitting for any length of time when the body is unduly heated, or by neglecting to change underclothing as soon as possible after profuse sweating.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1887#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—I read the paragraph in your paper of this month under the above title, and can add my testimony to the value of “Lamplough’s Pyretic Saline,” if not as a sure preventive, certainly as a deterrent and palliative in African fevers.\n\nIn your remarks, however, I find no mention made of the probable causes of such mortality, which I think is necessary when speaking of the effects of a climate like West Africa, the bad reputation of which is so very much exaggerated. Nor do you make any distinction between the colonies, classing Sierra Leone with Lagos, Gambia, and Cape Coast, which I am sure the facts would not warrant.\n\nTo revert, however, to the causes of mortality on the West Coast of Africa, I am of opinion that there are many influential causes conducing to the same which might be prevented, and I take the liberty of intruding on your valuable space to enumerate one or two of them.\n\n1. The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics. In Brazil, no doubt, some Europeans drink themselves to death, but they are few; the majority, being of a better class, prefer to live well and to enjoy themselves rationally, without making beasts of themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The (Colony of the)', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'This position altogether is so far clear. But we have been subject to such misrepresentations when combating stereotyped misstatements as regards West Africa, that we will not allow any one to misunderstand us. The opinions we put forward with regard to the climate of West Africa have not been hastily or crudely formed, nor have they been adopted to serve some temporary or interested purpose. They are the result of evidence that cannot be disproved. They are promulgated by us to remove prejudices which war against our efforts for the advancement of civilization in Africa, and because we feel that they are pregnant with most practical results. We do not, for instance, pretend that the West African climate is not unhealthy. We admit that it is. But we as fearlessly contend that it is not one whit more unhealthy for Europeans than many of the West India Islands, or than Hong Kong, China, or India, &c. These regions are equally liable to visitations of epidemic disease as is West Africa, in the shape of yellow fever, dysentery, &c. We are, moreover, firmly convinced that if ever the day arrives when complete, and not mere partial statistical tables, are compiled, showing the mortality amongst Europeans at the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and even the new settlement at Lagos, the facts fairly and impartially revealed will demonstrate that at least a moiety of the deaths which occur amongst them are not the result of climatic disease, but are chargeable occasionally to accident; more frequently to a lamentable and wanton neglect of ordinary care and precautions; and too often to reckless indulgences, which will in any climate sap the springs of life, and ultimately destroy it. As additional evidences in support of these statements, take, for example, the records with regard to the numerous governors who have served, or are now serving, in West Africa. We find that in most instances they were and are men who had passed middle life before being called upon to administer those Governments, and were consequently far less able to bear up against attacks of fever. Yet, of the thirty-four gentlemen who have governed Sierra Leone from 1792 to 1864, seven only died there in that long period of seventy-two years. Of those seven, one was killed in action, another veteran most unwisely made fruit and vegetables his sole diet; and one of them had previously lived upwards of thirty-five years in the colony, dying at sea, not of disease incident to the climate, but of cancer of the stomach.

The fact ought no longer to be concealed, that half at least of the deaths and incapacities which occur amongst Europeans arise from errors of personal economy, and that the mortality lists are unfairly swelled by ascribing to the climate deaths which have been caused by accident or intemperance.\n\nThe following passages may be adduced as proof that the climate is not to blame for everything:—', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.712, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of West Africa—Gold Mining—The Labour Question', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Now, first, as regards the climate and mode of living. With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—A very large holder of shares in the West African Gold Mines has called my attention to a paragraph which appeared in the Daily News of March 17th, in which a correspondent of that journal ""earnestly expresses a hope that those who are offered shares in Gold Coast Mines will inform themselves of the deadly nature of the climate for Europeans,"" and also asserts that ""a white man cannot live there and work; the natives cannot be induced to work: as soon as a road is made the jungle grows over it again; the air is poisonous; and the people are debased beyond conception.""\n\nHaving first landed on the West Coast of Africa exactly thirty-one years ago, since which time I have spent less than six years in Europe, the remainder of the period being passed on the Coast, the Gold Coast Colony included, and, moreover, having returned from a visit of six months to the Gold Mines so recently as the end of July last, I trust that you will kindly permit me to contradict, in the most unqualified manner, all the statements of the unknown correspondent of the Daily News.\n\nThe mere fact that I have passed more than half my life in Western Equatorial Africa, including one continued residence there of ten, and another of five years, and am now in good health, and that I can name many Europeans and Americans who have spent as many, if not more, years there, is in itself a sufficient refutation of the supposed (and quite illusory) ""deadly nature of the climate for Europeans,"" when they are not constitutionally unfitted for residence in tropical regions, and will take proper care of themselves, and listen to the advice of ""old Coasters.""

I could give you a list of a dozen or more personal friends, mostly traders, who have been on this Coast from ten to twenty years each, and are still strong, healthy men: it is true they have occasionally visited Europe during that time. Many young men shorten their lives by excess, carelessness, and exposure; *but I doubt if they would live long anywhere if they led such dissipated lives as they do here.* ""Climate"" is a common slang term for ""brandy,"" and is frequently employed ironically in that sense, because it is so much the fashion to attribute every death to ""that horrid climate,"" when those better informed know that a large proportion of Europeans hasten their own end by drink. One officer included among the victims of the Ashantee war was found dead in his bed, with a brandy bottle, nearly empty, under his pillow—at least, so ill-natured people said. Another victim of the said war died of epilepsy at Lagos, poor fellow! in fact, the ""war"" had to bear the blame of every death occurring among the troops at the time.\n\nThe much-abused traders, or ""palm-oil ruffians,"" as naval and military *gentlemen* politely term them after eating their dinners, drinking their wine, and perhaps winning their money, certainly undergo as many hardships and privations on many parts of the Coast as do their countrymen of the red coat and blue jacket; but by care and avoiding dissipation they manage to weather the ""climate"" for many years. I do not, however, wish to make any invidious comparison between the two classes; there are sober and steady, as there are dissipated and debauched, of each; how, then, is it the trader survives when the officer succumbs? Perhaps he who has escaped from the ""jaws of death"" (as I have done also several times) would say it is the consolatory hope of reaping ""pecuniary benefit."" It is at any rate somewhat strange that the traders who cannot run away from their business every time they are attacked by fever or dysentery should live, when the officer, who generally experiences little difficulty in getting invalided, should die. And I think this fact is a strong argument against those who abuse the traders and say they kill themselves with drink. One of the foremost in the rank of those who revile the traders was a certain ""young man about town,"" who came to ""flame"" in the ""virgin forest,"" ""kiss pretty savages,"" &c., and who experienced nothing but kindness and hospitality at the hands of the traders whom he met.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten.

Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa.

The ultimate answer in the contest for power in Africa therefore depended on the monopolization of arms and ammunition. This was not easy to achieve as long as Europeans pursued national interests and African rulers could play off one power against another. Moreover, in the essential search for allies, Europeans had to use the supply of quality guns to bargain for treaties, concessions, neutrality or active participation in wars against rival African states. It therefore became essential to regulate their Scramble on the basis of international agreements and, in particular, to limit the supply of arms and ammunition. The most intense rivalry was between the British and the French. The British tried to secure their interests by also playing the role of protectors of Portuguese interests. This gave Bismarck the opportunity to play the role of an interested broker by convening an International Conference in Berlin. This Conference in turn gave King Leopold his chance to seek for international support for his ambitions on the Congo by proclaiming free trade and humanitarian antislavery ambitions.$^{24}$ This prepared the way for the Brussels Act which banned the supply of arms to African rulers in the name of an anti-slavery campaign.\nThe truth was that by linking the limitation of arms with the anti-slavery campaign, the British were able to exempt the 'self-governing' settlers in South Africa from the operations of the Brussels Act. By this device also, while constantly fighting African states and negotiating various treaties and conventions with African rulers, they could pretend that, by owning slaves and dealing in slaves, African states enjoyed no recognition in international law.

We do not profess to be great proficients in military tactics, but what we here state is the common-sense view that any one who is well acquainted with the ins and outs of the countries about Prahsoo must arrive at. A little beyond Prahsoo, about three and a-half miles, lying E.N.E. half E., is the town of Atawascoo, and about half-a-mile from that place there is a cataract right across the river, formed by a layer of rocks, through which, during the dry season, an enemy can easily walk. During the late Ashantee invasion the greater part of the division under Essa Ma Quantah crossed over at Atawascoo and at this cataract, as is evident from the number of dilapidated tents to be found under cover of the high trees. This cataract, of course, during the rainy weather is a very dangerous path, and no one would attempt to cross by it. Again, there are fordable paths lower down the river, at some distance from Prahsoo, which no force at that place could protect. If the King of Ashantee intends to attack the camp, it is not to be supposed that he will be so idiotic as to send a small force of one or two thousand men, but he will send from twenty to thirty thousand. If 6,000 cross over at Atawascoo, and before the force at Prahsoo knows what it is about push on to Assempah Naya, on the road to the seacoast, thus entirely cutting off our retreat; another 4,000 cross over the third bend of the river below the camp, thus presenting themselves on the flank of the Prahsoo; and a small body of men appear before the fortified stockaded front of Prahsoo to draw our attention—what on earth could a small force of 200 men at Prahsoo do, 100 of whom are sick in hospital and fifty just out of hospital, and as weak as could be imagined? A sharp commander would at once get his sick into the stockade, with the whole of the people in the camp, excepting those on guard; but one night surprise by the Ashantees would prove a finale, as there would be a general shooting in the stockade. Of what use, then, are the handful of men left at the Prah? We firmly believe that the Ashantees will not again cross—certainly not till after harvest—and it seems highly probable that, as they have taken full reparation for the offence complained of by them, they will only wait for offensive movements on our side, should no treaty of peace be arranged with them.\n\nIt must be said that Lieut.-Colonel Conran has done all in his power to stay the awful mortality amongst the men, by proposing to remove them to a more healthy climate, but he has not been supported by the civil authority.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.07, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Medical Remarks re the African Climate and the Ashanti War', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The *Medical Times and Gazette* says: ""The first batch of invalids resulting from the \'little war\' forced upon us by the King of Ashanti have just reached this country in the Himalaya, and have been transferred to Haslar Hospital.

It might be worth while for officers to provide themselves with a small respirator, to be worn when exposed to the night air.

This last gave as his opinion, ""that a few thousands spent at Cameroons or Fernando Po would, calculating only the market value of seamen\'s lives, repay themselves in as many years."" But the pros and cons of that lofty range as a sanitarium must be considered, and officers on the Coast should be consulted before the Home Government attempt to spend a large amount on it. There are many advantages in its favour, as may be seen described in the work of Captain Burton, on ""Abeokuta and the Cameroons,"" but there are also some great disadvantages attaching to it as a military sanitarium.\n\nIts distance from the different military stations on the Coast is one great objection, as it is situated about 400 miles below the last—viz., Lagos. It will be no great consolation for a sick officer—laid up, perhaps, with intractable fever, debility, diarrhœa, or dysentery, to be ordered, say, from the Gambia or Sierra Leone, to the Cameroons Mountains, a distance of about 2,000 miles, in a steam-packet, which is most uncomfortable, and unadapted for the conveyance of the sick during a voyage of eighteen days, in a direction quite opposite to the accustomed route—viz., to Teneriffe, Madeira, or England. The result would be found invariably to be that most of the cases, and certainly all the serious dysenteric cases, would succumb before the patient could reach the mountain of good hope. As a naval sanitarium it would be excellent, as it is in the neighbourhood of the rendezvous of the West African squadron, extending from the Volta to the Island of Ascension; and of the great oil rivers, to which so many English merchant vessels resort.

It was a most distressing sight to witness the arrival of these poor creatures; and it is necessary to make a few preliminary remarks in order clearly to understand the difficulties with which the medical officers had to contend. The appearance of the slaves when landed was most striking. In some the expression of the countenance indicated sufferings, moral and physical, of the most profound and agonising nature. Others of them gazed vacantly around them in the most utter helplessness. Occasionally, among the newly-arrived groups all sense of suffering was merged in melancholic or raving madness. The wizened, shrunk, and skinny features were lighted up by the hollow, feverish eye. The belly was, as it were, tacked to the back, whilst the hip-bones protruded, and, in some cases, became the seat of foul, sloughing ulcers. The hand and skinny fingers seemed much elongated by the great and neglected growth of the nails, and they were so deplorably emaciated, that the skin appeared tensely stretched over, and tied down to the skeleton. The legs refused to perform their functions, and they reeled and tottered about from sheer debility. Their squalor and extreme wretchedness was heightened, in many cases, by the particoloured evacuations with which their bodies were besmeared. When large numbers of the sick were suffering from dysentery, the condition of the wards and yards in the morning was extremely loathsome. This was in a great degree unavoidable, as the sick were too weak to crawl from their mats to the commode, although everything was done under the surgeons\' orders to keep the wards as clean and wholesome as the crowded state of the hospital would admit of."" In a word, ""the moral and physical causes of depression were often so overwhelming, and so intensely concentrated, that the combination produced disease in such formidable shapes as to be beyond remedy. The mortality was consequently very great; many persons brought to the hospital in the last stage of disease died a few hours after their arrival; others even expired by the way.

These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy.

Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.698, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""However, the development which probably had the earliest impact on the mortality level was the penetration of the roads and railways. By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths. From 50 to 80 per cent have or have had syphilis or yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm,"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': ""Famines and psychological stress also left the uprooted and malnourished vulnerable to infectious diseases carried by the coastal traders. Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

Given the mortality levels described above (which is a conservative assumption in view of the fact that the health conditions of the forests of the west coast equatorial area have probably long been worse than elsewhere), the conclu› sion could be drawn that in the centuries past those areas averaging 5 births per woman had experienced population declines averaging over 0.5 per cent per annum, and those averaging 3.5 children declines of over 1.5 per cent per annum. This is inconceivable over any protracted period; the latter population would be halving every forty years, and both situations suggest much larger populations during the earlier years of European contact than has ever been suggested.

The first important beneficial social effect was the overall increase of the population of Africa during the colonial period by about 37.5%, as J. C. Caldwell has shown (Chapter 18), after its decline during the first two or three decades of colonialism. This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization. As A. E. Afigbo has emphasized (Chapter 19), urban› ization was of course not unknown in pre-colonial Africa. The kingdoms and empires of Africa had such capitals or political centres as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, Gao and Great Zimbabwe; such commercial centres as Kano, Jenne, Sofala and Malindi, and such educational centres as Timbuktu, Cairo and Fez. But there is no doubt that as a result of colonial› ism, the pace of urbanization was greatly accelerated. Completely new towns such as Abidjan in Ivory Coast, Takoradi in the Gold Coast, Port Harcourt and Enugu in Nigeria, Nairobi in Kenya, Salisbury (now Harare) in Southern Rhodesia, Lusaka in Northern Rhodesia and Luluabourg in the Kasai Province of the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) came into existence.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""Certainly in some areas stable administrations apparently resulted in increasing populations in the nineteenth century, such as apparently occurred in Egypt from early in the century as Muhammad$^{ c}$Alî extended irrigation and sanitation$^{53}$ and in Algeria after the French subjugated all opposition in 1879.$^{54}$ The necessity for such stability, especially as civilian instead of military administration became the rule around the turn of the century, arose out of the metropolitan powers' demand that their colonial administrations in Africa should be financially self-supporting.$^{55}$ Hence the increasing concentration on communications and export production.\nPerhaps the major demographic problem in the years up to the First World War centres on the so-called 'labour question' and on the conces› sionaire schemes of Middle Africa.\nIn the late nineteenth century it was the central belief of colonizers that colonies should be profitable. Whether this could be achieved or not depended entirely on African labour. Profits depended on moving goods and this meant human porterage in most of tropical Africa, for the tsetse fly often prevented the use of draught animals and the lack of roads or railways prevented powered and wheeled vehicles being used. In Middle Africa the most profitable produce was at first ivory which entailed huge quantities of labour for carrying tusks. With the development of the pneumatic bicycle tyre in the late 1880s and the pneumatic car tyre in the 1890s a huge demand for rubber was created, which could not be met for a generation by plantation rubber (the first Malayan plantation came into production in 1910). In the meantime tropical Africa and South America met the demand from wild rubber, found in Africa mostly in vines and also needing great quantities of labour for its collection and initial processing.."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""However, even in the inter-war period, labelled by contemporaries as one of 'colonial peace', military activities still punctuated African affairs in a severe manner. The professed European desire to keep Africa as militarily neutralized as possible was in fact never realized. The French introduced a law of conscription in 1919 whereby an African contingent of 10000 was to be annually obtained; the British developed a Sudan Defence Force, uniquely staffed by Sudanese as well as by British officers, but primarily directed to imperial strategic needs in the Near East as well as in East Africa. The Force Publique of the Belgian Congo, exhibiting the qualities both of occupation army and police force, was frequently used during this era to quell resistance expressed in the form of syncretistic religious movements.$^{29}$ On the scale of open warfare, events can be easily measured. The Italian campaign to subdue Libya in the 1920s and the Spanish and French effort to resolve the Rïf war in Morocco in the same period are obvious. But they are surpassed in scope by the rapacious war undertaken by Mussolini against the Ethiopians, an event with which the period here under consideration was tragically closed.\nThis account of military developments in Africa in the inter-war period does not seriously impair the assertion that divergent intentions of European colonial method and practice are those which, in retrospect, seem the most significant. There is little doubt that colonial bureaucratiza› tion did provide partial preparation for an unintended movement towards national independence. The configurations of a new political elite were slowly emerging, as lower-echelon clerks and appointed chiefs in various colonial services - but particularly the British - were learning to apply, if only modestly, Napoleon's imperative: 'careers open to talent'.

It is more difficult, but perhaps not impossible, to imagine that the level of disease (venereal disease and other infections) generated during this period still resulted in a high level of female sterility half a century or more afterwards. It is also difficult to feel that the situation in this region is adequately covered by a recent United Nations' publication writing of'cultural shock' and 'the processes of adjustment'. 71 Eventually the colonial penetration was to lead to a great increase in population. This was partly due to the establishment of an economic base which is evidenced by many developments discussed in several of the chapters above. Some of the more spectacular of them were the develop› ment of palm-oil exports from the Niger delta, the discovery of diamonds and then gold in Southern Africa in the years from 1870 to 1900, the development of an indigenous cocoa-growing industry in the Gold Coast in the 1890s and the discovery of huge deposits of copper between the Congo and Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) in the early years of the century."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.048, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Furthermore, though colonialism did introduce some social services as has been pointed out already, it must be emphasized that not only were these services grossly inadequate and unevenly distributed in each colony, but they were all by and large meant primarily for the benefit of the few white settlers and administrators, hence their concentration in the towns. Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi.

In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W. Gutteridge has admitted, the armed forces have 'operated in the longer term against the stability of the ex-colonies'.

But no; the health of the forces was good from August, 1863, until some three weeks after they had marched in several directions into the bush of the interior. The mortality and sickness has occurred only since the end of February, with few exceptions. The local error committed we deem to have been this: The rains commenced two months before their time. We think that on the very first day of rain, all idea of further duty in the field should have been abandoned, and nearly all the troops have been ordered back to Cape Coast Castle without delay. When once the rains began, no troops could go into Ashantee, and no Ashantees would come into the Territories. Again, the campaign being over, we think the Tamar's men, who would otherwise have been marched up to camp immediately, where there were rations, &c., for fifty or sixty days, ought not to have been landed, there being no adequate accommodation for them.

But the exhalations of a lately uncovered soil were poisonous; as also the water, which no attempt seems to have been made to purify, though sand was abundant, and charcoal enough might have been burned in a few days to form a filter bed for an army, instead of for a mere battalion.

For about thirty years he has occupied various important Government positions, being Colonial Surgeon at Lagos, Governor of the Gold Coast Colony of Bathurst, and last of all of the Sierra Leone Settlement. As Dr. Rowe his Excellency took part in the expedition of Lord (then Sir Garnet) Wolseley to Coomassie, and performed valuable service. Again, when there was the report of a threatened raid on the Gold Coast Settlement by the Ashantees Sir Samuel was specially despatched to the colony with a staff to defend the place. Fortunately, the intended attack did not take place. His Excellency has undertaken many missions for the pacification of the interior of Africa, and almost his last efforts were to establish peace on the Sherbro River and with the tribes immediately behind Sierra Leone. Sir Samuel Rowe was the best-known official on the West Coast of Africa, and it is probable that no one so well as his Excellency knew how to deal with the native races all along the coast. Sir Samuel left England about two years ago for Bathurst, River Gambia, to make certain investigations for the Colonial Office, and after adjusting matters there he proceeded to his previous post at Sierra Leone, in which vicinity he remained until he contracted the illness which ended in his death. His Excellency had the entire confidence of the English as well as the native traders on the coast and in England, and his death is another instance of a life lost through a strict devotion to duty on the unhealthy West Coast.""}, {'id': 6161, 'article_title': 'THE FRENCH IN WEST AFRICA', 'full_section_title': 'THE FRENCH IN WEST AFRICA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_11_1891#article-5', 'issue_date': '02_11_1891', 'content': '""These workmen were really the most docile ones in the world.

As soon as the tam-tam was heard in the morning, every one was afoot. The plain, the plateau, the road to the forest were furrowed with long lines of natives going in the greatest order to their respective fields of labour, led by their overseers. The work began at 6 a.m., to stop at 12. They ate then on the spot the food—rice and couscoussou—brought in calabashes by the women charged with the cooking. Work went on again from 2 to 6. The workers showed extraordinary zeal, the reason being that, coming all from the villages of Bouré or from the valley of the Bakhoy, and having had to suffer from the cruel rule of Samory and of his agents, they wished to see finished as soon as possible the fort destined in future to protect them from their oppressors of old.""\n\nIt would not interest the English reader to go into the details of Colonel Galliéni\'s campaigns against the chief and prophet Mahmadou Lamine, or of the various incidental marches, missions, and explorations. The point to be observed is that France is raising up what may be called an African Sepoy Army. The number of European troops employed was very small, a single company of marine infantry, another of artillery workmen, and about 150 artillerymen, but 1,000 Senegalese riflemen and a division of Senegalese spahis, armed with repeating Kropatscheck rifles, the artillery consisting of two mountain pieces and one revolving Hotchkiss cannon. The European soldiers, it may be observed, were invariably mounted, since ""the European cannot march in the Soudan,"" subject as he is, ""on an average,"" to an attack of fever every eight days. Of the native troops (commanded by Europeans) Colonel Galliéni says, speaking especially of the riflemen: ""In turn pioneers, artillerymen, couriers, transport-men, always ready, always devoted, it is through them that we hold the vast territories which extend to the Niger."" And there is no doubt that the French do succeed in inspiring even an enthusiastic devotion among the natives. Colonel Galliéni gives a touching account of the death of an interpreter, Alassane—a Mussulman too—who, when dying, and seeming not to know those who were about him, recovered consciousness on seeing Colonel Galliéni enter the hut, sitting up and exclaiming: ""Ah! mon Colonel! mon Colonel!"" and pressed Galliéni\'s hands to his breast whilst repeating the words, ""France! France!"" then calling his younger son Ali, put the Frenchman\'s hand upon that of the lad as if to recommend him, and from that time lost consciousness.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Medical Remarks re the African Climate and the Ashanti War', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The *Medical Times and Gazette* says: ""The first batch of invalids resulting from the \'little war\' forced upon us by the King of Ashanti have just reached this country in the Himalaya, and have been transferred to Haslar Hospital. They appear to have suffered severely from the malarious climate of Cape Coast, the small contingent of Marine Artillery and Light Infantry sent from England at the outbreak of the war contributing no less than three officers and eighty-five non-commissioned officers and men to the numbers just arrived. The head-quarters of the 2nd West India Regiment were only disembarked at Cape Coast on July 11 last; but although from the nature of their constant duties in the tropics, they might have been expected to be somewhat acclimatized; they speedily began to suffer from the prevailing forms of fever and dysentery. Many of the officers were attacked; the colonel of the regiment has come home in the Himalaya invalided, and the adjutant died a few days before the news left.\n\nA correspondent writes to the *Pall Mall Gazette*: ""The invalids from the West Coast of Africa state that dysentery and fever were engendered by the supply of bad water and defective salt provisions. They assert, and they have not been contradicted, that the pork stored at Cape Coast Castle for the use of the garrison and troops, is inferior in quality, and therefore not fit to be served out. The fever which has proved so fatal to the Royal Artillery is one of a bilious type.""\n\n**Hints for the Ashanti Expedition.**—We would advise officers and others to provide themselves with as few things as practicable by way of outfit for the field; to wear flannel or serge; have good boots and a light, easy head-dress; to avoid spirits, as a rule; to use condensed or boiled water whenever practicable, and to use filtered water when not—a pocket filter being provided for that purpose; to take a certain quantity of quinine as a daily article of diet, and not as a medicine, and always to begin the day with a good breakfast, and end it by taking care to guard against malaria by some covering above and waterproof sheet below, lighting a fire whenever practicable. It might be worth while for officers to provide themselves with a small respirator, to be worn when exposed to the night air. These are now being procured of very small size, and capable of being worn inside the lips, so as to be invisible. And we would advise them all to get re-vaccinated, and those who smoke to carry a supply of tobacco for their pipes.—*The Lancet*.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-09-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_09_1873#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Health Question in the Ashanti Expedition', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It is universally admitted that the Ashanti Expedition will be successful or disastrous in proportion to the extent in which we can maintain life, health, and vigour among the officers and men employed. The health question is, therefore, the all-important one. We have shown how deeply we felt this by our letters to the Colonial and War Offices, and to the Admiralty, on the subject. We fear these letters have been unavailing. Great parade has been made, from time to time, of the medical stores shipped at Woolwich, but we have never yet observed anything to indicate, much less to establish as a fact, that Lamplough\'s Pyretic Saline has found any, much less that very important place it should have occupied among them. Castor oil is no doubt a most useful medicine, and one that cannot be dispensed with; but for the battle with African fever we should have preferred to see that thousands of dozens of Lamplough\'s Pyretic Saline had been sent out, instead of thousands of pounds of castor oil. The great object in view ought undoubtedly to have been that the European troops dispatched to the Gold Coast should, on their arrival, be in full and secure condition as regards health, for an immediate forward march on Kumasi. From the evidence forwarded to us in the first instance by his Excellency Governor Hill, then of Sierra Leone, and that subsequently gathered from civilian experience, it seems clear that there ought to be, on the part of every man intended for active service in West Africa, an antecedent use, as well as a free subsequent use, of fever medicines, among which Lamplough\'s Saline and Quinine are entitled to the first place. We, therefore, recommended that the officers and men embarked should have Pyretic Saline and Quinine daily administered to them during the whole of their voyage out, by which means they would enter the fever zone with blood so prepared against the action of the fever causes which there prevail as to prevent these producing those results which too often attend a visit to the West Coast of Africa. It is, alas! an indisputable fact that Europeans have invariably the malarious fever enemy—either common or African fever, or yellow fever—to contend with on that Coast, even as they have the ""jungle fever"" to contend with in certain districts in the East Indies. The battle with this insidious and destructive enemy must be fought, there is no alternative; and the sooner the campaign is opened against it by the man who invades its favourite haunts, the greater chance he will have of achieving a victory over it. If he wait until the fever attack him, he may conquer, but the chances are heavy against him; and even if he conquer, it will not be without great sacrifice of vital energy; whereas if he prepare against the attack, the chances will be ninety-nine to one in his favour as regards the preservation of his life, and of his powers for active service; at least for a period, so long as this Ashanti Expedition could possibly last. We fear that the 23rd, the Rifles, the ""Black Watch,"" and other troops and officers who have been sent out, have not had the advantage we desired for them; that the superior official wisdom which presides over their destinies as soldiers, has decreed that they must await the attack of fever before beginning the war against it.

We feel deeply anxious about these brave men. Lord Derby says the Ashanti War is more a doctor and engineer\'s than a soldier\'s war; and there can be little doubt that it will be difficult to obtain the result we desire, unless we can manage to preserve the health and lives of our men. We do not need to be informed that there is every desire on the part of the Government and army and medical authorities to compass this important object; what we fear is, that the men may fall victims to routine and professional prejudice. As we have pointed out in our letter to the Secretary of State for War (p. 193), the sad experience of the first batch of Marines sent out to the Coast demonstrates that our fears on this point have but too solid a foundation to rest upon. We know where the hitch is. Such medicines as Lamplough\'s Pyretic Saline and Warburg\'s Tincture are not in the Medical Pharmacopoeia. True, they are invaluable—the first to prevent, the second to cure malarious fevers—ample experience has fully demonstrated this; but there being some secret in their preparation or composition, they are not in the Pharmacopoeia; and it is more satisfactory, we suppose, that officers and men should sicken and die en règle, however valuable their lives may be, than that they should be kept in health, or restored rapidly to health and duty, by preparations which the Pharmacopoeia chooses to ignore. We feel all the gravity of the case, and should certainly not interfere, except that officers and soldiers\' lives, and health for duty, are of more importance in our eyes than professional prejudice and pride. A propos of this, Dr. Johnson, Physician to William IV., and Editor of the Medico-Chirurgical Review, wrote: ""Would any man in his senses, or who has any regard for the welfare of his patients, refuse to administer James\'s Powder, Battley\'s Sedative Liquor, or Ruspini\'s Styptic, because the inventors refuse to make known the composition of these remedies?"" We shall say very little more. The danger which these men incur, unless adequate precautions be taken, is, alas! too well known; but Lamplough\'s Pyretic Saline as a preventive, and Warburg\'s Tincture as a rapid remedy and restorer, may reduce that danger to a minimum; and ample stores of these preparations ought therefore to go with the troops. It is possible that the success or non-success of Sir Garnet Wolseley\'s efforts, will depend upon whether Government has expended a few thousand pounds for such stores. What is done, should be done now—at the very outset. It will be too late when half the officers and men have died, and the other half been disabled by malarious fevers; and a heavy responsibility will rest on those who may have neglected to profit by the lessons of past experience.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-10-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_10_1873#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sanitariums for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""It is evident, therefore, that the best military sanitarium is that which is situated, more or less, in the centre of the military stations on the Coast.

Officers there are consequently more seldom affected by the malaria in the low land. Still further in the interior, Leicester Mountain stands in great prominence, above 2,000 feet above the sea's level, possessing a fine table land on its summit, and an agreeable and pleasant view all round. Beyond this is the Sugar Loaf, a mountain from 3,000 to 4,000 feet in height, and second to none in Western Africa, except that at Cameroons and Fernando Po. It commands a most extensive view towards the sea, and the most picturesque scenery that could be viewed, at least in Western Africa. Far above the miasma of the valley and plains, it is pointed out by nature as the sanitarium from the injurious influences of the low lands, and it only requires the ingenuity of man to make it habitable. Winterbottom, Aitkin, and Clarke, have all spoken of the healthiness of the mountains of Sierra Leone, but without effect; in former years periodical visits were made to it, and its value as the most healthy spot in Sierra Leone—and, in fact, in that portion of Western Africa situated between the Gambia and Lagos—was much appreciated by military and naval officers.\n\nAs a committee of the House of Commons will soon meet to consider all matters relative to the government of Western Africa, I hope, my Lord, you will urge the necessity of a good military sanitarium on the Sugar Loaf Mountain at Sierra Leone, and a station at Leicester Mountain.\n\nHow invaluable it would have been had the poor sick soldiers who were engaged in the Ashantee expedition had a sanitarium to go to.

This last gave as his opinion, ""that a few thousands spent at Cameroons or Fernando Po would, calculating only the market value of seamen\'s lives, repay themselves in as many years."" But the pros and cons of that lofty range as a sanitarium must be considered, and officers on the Coast should be consulted before the Home Government attempt to spend a large amount on it. There are many advantages in its favour, as may be seen described in the work of Captain Burton, on ""Abeokuta and the Cameroons,"" but there are also some great disadvantages attaching to it as a military sanitarium.\n\nIts distance from the different military stations on the Coast is one great objection, as it is situated about 400 miles below the last—viz., Lagos. It will be no great consolation for a sick officer—laid up, perhaps, with intractable fever, debility, diarrhœa, or dysentery, to be ordered, say, from the Gambia or Sierra Leone, to the Cameroons Mountains, a distance of about 2,000 miles, in a steam-packet, which is most uncomfortable, and unadapted for the conveyance of the sick during a voyage of eighteen days, in a direction quite opposite to the accustomed route—viz., to Teneriffe, Madeira, or England. The result would be found invariably to be that most of the cases, and certainly all the serious dysenteric cases, would succumb before the patient could reach the mountain of good hope. As a naval sanitarium it would be excellent, as it is in the neighbourhood of the rendezvous of the West African squadron, extending from the Volta to the Island of Ascension; and of the great oil rivers, to which so many English merchant vessels resort.

Yes, here is new evidence of the fact, that the denunciations hurled by the families of victims, and by journalists ignorant in these matters, upon the climate of certain portions of the globe under British rule or power, in which British soldiers, sailors, and civilians have to serve, ought rather to be heaped on the authorities who so unnecessarily and wantonly sacrifice the lives of their fellow-subjects and fellow-servants.

The French Government having received an official report of its serious outbreak at Senegal, despatched immediately a medical reinforcement of six doctors, with adequate supplies of all kinds, to meet the dread emergency. The ravages committed by this malady during its former visits to the West Coast of Africa, when so large a proportion of the Europeans in some of the settlements fell victims to it; and the fearful outbreak of small-pox, of a peculiarly virulent character, among the natives, which attended it in its progress, were so painfully fresh in our memory, that we lost not a moment in calling the attention of Her Majesty\'s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies to the news received, and the measures adopted by the French Government; and soliciting that additional medical aid, with abundant supplies of vaccine lymph, should be also despatched by Her Majesty\'s Government to the West Coast settlements. We have since received an assurance from the Colonial Office that some immediate measures would be taken. We cannot, however, conceal our deep anxiety as regards that dreaded visitant. When it last made its appearance at Bathurst, it carried off its victims with extreme rapidity; and its subsequent progress southward was of an equally distressing character; while the records in our Journal of the heart-rending scenes witnessed by Dr. Horton when on his vaccination tour through the Anamaboe district, attest how deeply the native population must be interested in the matter. Our fear is, that with the cessation of the rains, the Yellow Fever will travel southward from Senegal, and that ere long we shall have to depore its outbreak at Bathurst and Sierra Leone. We do not wish to spread alarm, but we do wish that the imminence of the peril may impel the Colonial authorities to adopt and enforce without delay all possible sanitary precautions. The accounts we have lately received of flagrant inattention as regards this important matter by the authorities at Bathurst and Sierra Leone, who are supposed to be charged with the responsibility of attending to it, are of a nature to deepen our alarm when we hear of Yellow Fever in the neighbourhood. All ordinary reasoning would have justified us in believing that when Her Majesty\'s Government adopted for Bathurst and Sierra Leone the most unusual, if not unprecedented, course of entrusting the local administration to gentlemen of the Army Medical Department, they had at least done what would insure that due attention would be given to sanitary measures. How are we to account for the result not having justified our belief? It cannot be that there were supreme orders that ""no money should be spent"" on what is so vital not only to the prosperity, but to the continued existence of British settlements on the West Coast; and if it be not owing to this, we say it with all proper respect for authorities appointed by the Queen, it cannot be otherwise accounted for than that these authorities are totally unfitted for the responsible posts entrusted to them. Should the Yellow Fever, and the virulent small-pox, its ordinary accompaniment on the West Coast, visit the settlements, their ravages cannot fail to be aggravated by that neglect of sanitary precautions of which complaint is continually reaching us; and the authorities, who have neglected those precautions, although they may not be made criminally liable, as they will have deserved, will at least incur a moral responsibility which may well overwhelm them, if their long familiarity with human sufferings under various diseases shall not have destroyed all ordinary feelings of humanity within their bosoms. We hope these observations from our pen will reach these authorities before the fearful visitants make their appearance; and that all past neglect will be atoned for by an activity as ardent as their apathy has been torpid. We call on all the authorities down the Coast, from Bathurst to Lagos—on all the masters of trading hulks at Bonny, Benin, New and Old Calabar, and Cameroons, and the heads of all trading stations on the South-west Coast, to commence without delay all possible sanitary measures. The Spanish Governor of Fernando Po would act wisely in taking similar precautions. Should the dreaded malady not spread southward from Senegal—as we fervently hope, but cannot believe will be the case—nothing will have been lost by the activity and expense that may have been made and exhibited. Sanitary measures, if properly conceived and carried into execution, must always be productive of benefit to the general health in the absence of virulent epidemics, as well as being influential in arresting and mitigating the spread and intensity of these when they do make their appearance. Among the blessings of British rule ought most certainly to be included a comparative immunity from epidemical diseases, owing to the adoption and enforcement of sanitary regulations; and it is time that efforts be really made in the British settlements on the West Coast to remove the natural stimulating agents of disease, and by sanitary police regulations put an end to all that filthiness which is represented to us as making the atmosphere of many of the Coast towns repulsively sickening and almost unbearable. Lessons in cleanliness are lessons in civilization; and there can be no reason that we know of why Sierra Leone, Bathurst, Cape Coast, Accra, and Lagos should not be made at least as healthy as Calcutta, Madras, and', 'last_edit_date': '1878-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1878#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Outbreak of Fever in the West African Squadron', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We are enabled to state that, according to the latest accounts received, the fatal cases of fever have been confined to the Active, flying the broad pendant of Commodore Sir William Hewett, V.C., K.C.B.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths. From 50 to 80 per cent have or have had syphilis or yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm,"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The years from the early 1880s to the mid-iojos mark the demographic divide in Africa. At the beginning of the period the continent's population was still sparse, at least by the standards of the Old World. More signifi› cantly it probably was not growing rapidly and evidenced a vulnerability to the kind of pressures, both internal and external, which were being increasingly applied. By about 1935, the population was undoubtedly grow› ing because of increasing control over mortality, and the basis was laid for a doubling over the next third of a century which almost certainly hastened and consolidated independence.\nMany indices can be used to illustrate the changes between the two dates, and some help to explain the demographic transition. In 1880 a European presence inland from the coast was largely restricted to Algeria, where a third of a million migrants, mainly from France, Spain, Italy and Malta, had consolidated the victory of the French army, and South Africa, where a similar number of Europeans, predominantly of Dutch and English extraction, now had a vanguard as far north as the Limpopo river. (See Fig. i.i.) Elsewhere Europeans were beginning to exert control over Egypt and Tunisia, ruled some coastal populations in Senegal and the Gold Coast (now Ghana) and held such enclaves as The Gambia, Sierra Leone, Lagos, Libreville and parts of Angola and Mozambique. By 1935 European administations controlled almost the entire continent (see Fig. 12.2). The half century saw European medical science progressing from an ignorance of the cause of most of Africa's major diseases to an ability to contain or cure most of them; indeed the period ends just as the sulpha drugs were ushering in an era of chemotherapy of great significance for the continent.

Without doubt the upsetting of stable populations, leading in the Congo Free State and elsewhere in Middle Africa to an upsurge in the death rate, the slow reduction in mortality in other parts of the continent during the nineteenth century and generally in this century, and the accelerating nucleation of population in towns and on mining fields owed nearly everything to the industrial revolution and to increasing contact with people from industrial societies. Much of this process would have occurred even without colonial rule: the traders would have provoked trading centres into growth; European medical schools would have become interested in the problem of protecting the traders and others from tropical disease; missionaries would have laid the foundations of a hospital system.\nNevertheless, direct colonial rule certainly speeded up all these processes. Eventually, and certainly towards the end of our period, it helped to reduce the great peaks of mortality by increasingly and effectively importing and utilizing epidemic control technology and creating a modern transport system which could distribute food in areas of famine. The need for administrative centres provided a nucleus for new towns, and colonial administrations' guarantees of personal safety and investment security to the nationals of their metropolitan countries hastened the growth of com› mercial settlements, mining camps and plantations. Without colonial administrations European entrepreneurs might well have been even more rapacious and murderous than they were. Europeans usually justified the colonial penetration by pointing to these achievements. Yet the history of Latin America and China shows that in time most of these gains would have been achieved in any case; the growth of industrialization was irreversible and a modus vivendi with Africa and other developing areas, from which needed raw materials were secured, was essential."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'Much the same doubts could be cast on another of the trade goods, guns.

The deaths were rarely a product of the original extension of administration, but rather of the suppression of subsequent revolts and of the ensuing punitive expeditions which apparently often inflicted most damage because of starvation resulting from the upsetting of the subsistence farming cycle. Examples include the thousands killed in Senegal in 1886 when opposing the building of a railway$^{51}$ and in the Ndebele war in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in 1893, the long-drawn-out suppression of the BÆtetela rebellion in the Congo Free State from 1895 to 1907, and a series of episodes in German South West Africa (now Namibia) between 1901 and 1906. Greater disasters racked Tanganyika (now Tanzania), where the Germans adopted a 'scorched earth' policy in the 1905-6 Majï Majï rebellion resulting perhaps in hundreds of thousands of deaths largely from starvation,$^{52}$ and where fighting between British and German forces throughout the First World War undoubtedly raised mortality levels again. More complex, but certainly arising indirectly out of the presence of Europeans, was the devastation caused in areas surrounding the Zulu nation after 1800 and in the Zulu Wars from 1879 until the last rebellion in 1906.

Even as it was, the white population of the continent had increased thirty times from 25000 in 1800, found mostly in the Cape, to three-quarters of a million in 1880, of whom five-sixths were in South Africa, Algeria and Egypt. By 1935 it had multiplied again by five to 3.75 million, of whom half were in South Africa, a quarter in Algeria and a further fifth in the rest of North Africa. During the same period, Asians (almost entirely Indians except for a few small Chinese communities of which the largest was on the Rand) increased from about 50000 to over a third of a million of whom over two-thirds were in South Africa. Change was coming but few perceived it clearly as is evident from a serious European appraisal of the racial numbers in Algeria in the 1920s: \'Most Frenchmen in Africa had little to fear of there ever being another serious effort to overthrow authority; for, as they point out, there are over eight hundred thousand Europeans to five and a half million natives who have little cohesion and could not do much more than indulge in sporadic outbreaks."" 05 In 1935 Africa stood at the brink of rapid population growth, which would take its numbers - which had already grown according to our estimates from 120 million in 1880 to 165 million - to 200 million by the late 1940s, 300 million by the mid-1960s and inevitably to 400 million in the mid-1970s. Of the latter number, 50 million would be in cities with more than 100 000 inhabitants, a far cry from the Africa of the partition of the 1880s with its debate about creating a labour force.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A fragile population emerging from near stability', 'content': 'This picture is not in any way surprising.

Given the mortality levels described above (which is a conservative assumption in view of the fact that the health conditions of the forests of the west coast equatorial area have probably long been worse than elsewhere), the conclu› sion could be drawn that in the centuries past those areas averaging 5 births per woman had experienced population declines averaging over 0.5 per cent per annum, and those averaging 3.5 children declines of over 1.5 per cent per annum. This is inconceivable over any protracted period; the latter population would be halving every forty years, and both situations suggest much larger populations during the earlier years of European contact than has ever been suggested.

It is more difficult, but perhaps not impossible, to imagine that the level of disease (venereal disease and other infections) generated during this period still resulted in a high level of female sterility half a century or more afterwards. It is also difficult to feel that the situation in this region is adequately covered by a recent United Nations' publication writing of'cultural shock' and 'the processes of adjustment'. 71 Eventually the colonial penetration was to lead to a great increase in population. This was partly due to the establishment of an economic base which is evidenced by many developments discussed in several of the chapters above. Some of the more spectacular of them were the develop› ment of palm-oil exports from the Niger delta, the discovery of diamonds and then gold in Southern Africa in the years from 1870 to 1900, the development of an indigenous cocoa-growing industry in the Gold Coast in the 1890s and the discovery of huge deposits of copper between the Congo and Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) in the early years of the century."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A fragile population emerging from near stability', 'content': ""Confining our attention to the area outside the low fertility zone, we can hazard some reasonably good guesses about pre-modern sub-Saharan populations by employing stable population methods of analysis. '$^{7}$ But first two problematic issues should be noted. One is the birth rate, which is most unlikely ever to have been higher than its present level. It may have remained constant, as the evidence of the age structure recorded over fifty years by the censuses of the Gold Coast and Ghana suggest. '$^{8}$ On the other hand, improving health conditions may have reduced sterility and sub-fecundity, as has been suggested at least in the cases of Kenya and Mauritius.$^{19}$ If this has been the case, it is improbable that pre-modern fertility was less than 90 per cent of that now found and most unlikely that it was under 80 per cent. The other is the possibility that the population has not been stationary, but has been averaging a rate of growth of up to 0.5 per cent per annum for several centuries (for reasons which will be discussed below). The full range of possibilities allows us to describe a society where women averaged 5.5-7 live births yielding a birth rate of 42-50 per thousand, and where the expectation of life at birth was 20-30 years yielding a death rate of 38-50 per thousand and an infant mortality rate of 250-375 deaths per thousand live births. A medium assumption might be a situation where women averaged little more than six live births, where population growth averaged 0.33 per cent, where the expectation of life at birth was about 22.5 years (about the level of Rome at the end of the Republic)$^{20}$ and where the crude birth rate was about 48 per thousand, the crude death rate 45 per thousand and the infant mortality rate 300-350 per thousand.

The first important beneficial social effect was the overall increase of the population of Africa during the colonial period by about 37.5%, as J. C. Caldwell has shown (Chapter 18), after its decline during the first two or three decades of colonialism. This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization. As A. E. Afigbo has emphasized (Chapter 19), urban› ization was of course not unknown in pre-colonial Africa. The kingdoms and empires of Africa had such capitals or political centres as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, Gao and Great Zimbabwe; such commercial centres as Kano, Jenne, Sofala and Malindi, and such educational centres as Timbuktu, Cairo and Fez. But there is no doubt that as a result of colonial› ism, the pace of urbanization was greatly accelerated. Completely new towns such as Abidjan in Ivory Coast, Takoradi in the Gold Coast, Port Harcourt and Enugu in Nigeria, Nairobi in Kenya, Salisbury (now Harare) in Southern Rhodesia, Lusaka in Northern Rhodesia and Luluabourg in the Kasai Province of the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) came into existence.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'the Fulani conquests in Nigeria produced large numbers of refugees and prisoners;$^{31}$ but without doubt the existence of the market on the coast increased capricious violence producing victims of extra lawlessness or of the harsher implementation of customary law.

Though there were European settlers in the North African states and in South Africa before the colonial era, there is no doubt that not only did the number of these people increase but European and Asiatic settlers were also introduced into East and Central Africa and parts of West Africa during the colonial days. As M. H. Y. Kaniki has shown above (Chapter 16), the number of Europeans in Kenya rose from only 596 in 1903 to 954 in 1905, to 5438 in 1914 and to 16663$^{ m x}$9$^{2}$9;$^{tnat m}$ Southern Rhodesia increased from 11000 in 1901 to over 35000 by 1926,$^{33}$ and that in Algeria from 344000 in 1876 to 946000 in 1936. But in many areas in East, Central and North Africa, what made their presence so inimical to Africans was that the Europeans came to occupy most of the fertile lands, while the Asiatics monopolized the retail and wholesale trade. In West Africa, too, the Asiatics - Syrian, Lebanese and Indians - whose population increased from only 28 in 1897 to 276 in 1900, 1910 in 1909, 3000 in 1929 and to 6000 by 1935 also drove out their African competitors.

For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces. In some areas labour was recruited from overseas, such as the importation of Indians to build the Mombasa-Uganda railway at the beginning of the present century and to cultivate sugar in Natal from as early as i860.

There was a large mortality amongst the European population in the town. This points out the urgency for sanitary works, as most of the deaths were due to malaria. The prevention, or at least the mitigation, of this evil should be the first subject to which attention is paid. That it is possible to eradicate malaria from its most favoured haunts has been repeatedly proved. To find a remedy it must first be known what are the conditions necessary and most favourable to its development. It is not necessary to know the nature of the malarial poison if its production can be prevented, or at least curtailed: the two chief conditions are subsoil moisture and a high temperature. It is in the tropics that these conditions predominate. To combat them it is necessary to drain the subsoil and lower the temperature of the surface. Nature supplies in vegetation a simple means of attaining these ends. Pittenkofer has calculated that an oak-tree which had 751,592 leaves had from May to October an evaporation equal to 212 inches, whilst the rainfall over an area equal to that covered by the tree was only 25.6 inches, so that the evaporation was 8.3 times the rainfall. The eucalyptus in Algeria has been calculated to evaporate twelve times the rainfall. The water for evaporation is supplied from the subsoil by the roots, which penetrate in all directions. Whilst getting rid of the water from the soil, the evaporation cools the air, and the shade afforded by the trees protects the soil from the direct rays of the sun. If we acknowledge the influence of high temperature in producing malaria, the great advantage to be gained by sheltering the soil from the direct rays of the sun is evident, when we consider that when the temperature in the shade is 80°, in exposed parts it is nearly double. As a sandy soil has twice the capacity for retaining heat as humus, the disadvantage of having large unshaded sandy plains in the neighbourhood is evident. Such plains are hotbeds of malaria. These plains arise from the destruction of the forests, which is brought about partly for the purpose of supplying fuel, but mainly in order to clear the land for cultivation. The virgin soil, never particularly rich, is capable of producing crops for four or five years. The land is then deserted, and becomes overgrown with grass, which, being periodically burnt, prevents the re-growth of the forest. The exposed soil is impoverished by the heavy rainfall carrying away all the organic matter, so that further cultivation is impossible. This is notably the case about Accra, where the open plains radiate for about ten or twelve miles from the town. As a sanitary measure, it is suggested that the planting of quick-growing and shade-producing trees in the open spaces, in the compounds of houses, and the streets, should be proceeded with at once. All the streets should be shaded with trees, which should be planted so as to give the maximum shade with the minimum interference with the circulation of air. The eucalyptus has been largely used for this purpose, but it does not thrive in Lagos, owing, I think, to the poor sandy soil. One planted in the hospital compound in 1882 is now covered with flower buds, but the tree has not gained its reputed dimensions. There are many local trees that would answer our purpose better.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1888#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Great Britain: Her Colonies and Settlements', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'introduction into at least the seats of government such as Cape Coast, Accra, and Lagos, of such sanitary measures as would remove from them their tropical and uncivilized unhealthiness. Very little, however, has been done in this direction; as the constant complaints from Lagos and Cape Coast, chronicled in their local journals, but too clearly establish. There is no blame lying at our door for this. Fifteen or more years ago we reproached one of the Governors as being satisfied to live on a dung-heap, if only he might follow his own vicious propensities; and the Governors may have become more moral, but they do not seem to have become more delicate. The public discussions in such a Colonial Representative Chamber sitting in London, as we have suggested, would soon lead to a change for the better in such important matters. There can be no reason why Accra, Cape Coast, Lagos, and other towns should not be made as healthy as Calcutta now is; Calcutta, than which no more fatally unhealthy place existed, when British rule was first established itself there.

The want of proper sanitary measures is another reason why the climate of West Africa proves fatal to many European constitutions. When streets and yards, both back and front of houses, are made the receptacles of filth and excrement, of putrified remains of dead dogs, cats, and other animal and vegetable matter, is it to be wondered at that the miasma rising from these dung-heaps eventually becomes fatal to those constantly inhaling it. This is a cause which it would be well for the colonial authorities here to take into their serious consideration, as it is most certainly a preventible one. It was only in 1871, during the administration of Mr. J. Pope Hennessy, that the sanitary condition of Freetown seriously occupied the attention of the Government; but whether that gentleman’s plans have ever been efficiently carried out, and what effects they have hitherto had there, we have no means here to ascertain.\n\n3. The Europeans on the West Coast of Africa, unlike their countrymen in India, South America, and elsewhere, perhaps for the reasons I have already stated, are so careless of their personal comfort, and so intent upon accumulating as much money as they can, that they deny themselves every convenience necessary in a tropical climate. In Sierra Leone, for instance, they live in the town, which is at the sea-shore, instead of on the mountains, where they would enjoy the sea breezes equally as well, and be in a cooler and healthier atmosphere. In support of this view, I will only quote a passage which occurs in a paper read by Mr. Hennessy before the Society of Arts in April, 1873, in which he says: “The mountain district (of Sierra Leone), according to the Registrar-General’s Returns, appears to be as healthy as any part of England, or indeed as Madeira, the climate of which it closely resembles.”\n\nI hope I have clearly shown that the large mortality on the West Coast of Africa is not entirely due to climatic influences, and that a great deal could be done by the Government and the Europeans to counteract and mitigate those influences. As living proofs of what I have stated, I beg to point out Mr. Magnus Smith, Mr. A. Montagu, Mr. Marston, and half-a-dozen others, who have resided in Sierra Leone for fifteen or twenty years without meeting with the same fate as their countrymen, and simply because they have known how to live.—I am, dear Sir,', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.712, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE MEAT-SUPPLY OF LAGOS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'to provide, as far as possible, for the safety and security of human life, the introduction and enforcement of sanitary regulations should be a matter of primary concern with the Governors of the British West African Settlements. This is not a new contention of ours. Years and years ago we clamoured for a purification of the atmosphere of Sierra Leone; years and years ago, and notoriously at the time when Mr. Ussher was Administrator at Cape Coast, we called attention to, and stigmatized as it deserved, the abominably pestiferous condition of Cape Coast and Accra; using, if we remember rightly, the expression that the Chief British authorities were quite content to sit and lie upon a dunghill, so that they might indulge in their own particular enjoyments. To improve the atmosphere of the West Coast towns, by putting an end to those malarious effluvias that poison it, and make it deadly not only to the majority of Europeans, but, and especially at periods when small-pox and other epidemics are raging, to the natives themselves, ought to have been, as they have not been, among the earliest and most persistent efforts of civilized government. We believe something has been done of late in this direction; but we would have the sanitary screw put far more strongly on the populations than it has hitherto been; while at the same time the causes, other than human, of poisonous effluvia and miasma should be gradually removed. The evils which have been allowed to exist with regard to the meat-supply at Lagos come now for the first time under our notice; and we do not allow even one month to pass without thus pointedly calling the attention of the Acting Lieutenant-Governor and other superior officials there to so prolific a cause of the most fearful diseases and death, as the consumption by any classes of the population whatever of flesh in a state of poisonous putrefaction and decay. We feel sure it can only be necessary thus to bring the matter before the authorities to insure a stop being put to practices which must constantly threaten to engender some fearful epidemic that might sweep off the major portion of the population. If even in highly civilized European communities, such as those of Great Britain and France, it is found necessary to have inspectors always on the watch, to prevent the sale of diseased and decaying meat, fish, and other articles of human food, it cannot be regarded as at all surprising that in a place like Lagos, where the great mass of the population has not yet emerged from the filth of barbarism, some similar precautions should be indispensable. It is horrible to think of what is being eaten in Lagos, presuming as we do that we may rely on the account given by ""Sanitas."" We cannot credit for a moment that any of the civilized persons in the Lagos community are at any time consumers of the denounced abominations. Other education brings with it, in a greater or less degree, an education of the palate and the olfactory nerve also; and both nose and palate protest against the approach of what is necessarily disgusting to them. Civilization thus protects its children from many evils to which the uncivilized are exposed. But the civilized cannot with impunity look on with selfish indifference, while their less favoured brothers and sisters are exposed to perish, through want of that defending knowledge with which they themselves are blessed. It is a wise provision of nature that binds up the weal or woe of every individual more or less with that of the community to which he belongs. This acts as a great defence of the poor and ignorant; because not only feelings of humanity, which might be stifled, but the instinct of self-preservation operates in their behalf. We warn the civilized and educated in Lagos, and in every other settlement on the Coast in which any similar practices to those denounced at Lagos may unhappily prevail (if there be such), that for their own safety, if they be not influenced by any higher or more generous motive, they must, without delay, set about the work of putting an end to the horrible blood poisoning by means of deleterious food that is going on around them. And although the appetites of the poor wretched, ignorant creatures who, in their craving for animal food, thus banquet on disgusting garbage, may be so debased that they do not at first understand why they should be deprived of the abominations to which they have become habituated, they will, within a very short time, be brought by their own improved senses to comprehend that what had been done was done for their good. This will be a step gained by civilization among them—a primary lesson in their education—and can only be attended with generally beneficial results. We, moreover, quite agree with our correspondent that it will be an advantage gained by the whole community if stringent police restrictions on the killing and sale of flesh meat, other than poultry, should have the additional effect of leading to a discontinuance of the trade by females, except where they are recognized as merely acting as saleswomen of the flesh of animals killed legitimately, and while in a proper state of health, by their husband, or other male member of their family. Everything that tends in any, however small a degree, to elevate the condition of woman is a positive gain to the community. There is no true civilization without this advance of woman in the social scale. We have often thought this is not sufficiently in the minds of the educated natives on the West Coast. It is, however, so essential to civilized progress, that there is no real civilized progress without it; and every educated man should endeavour to discourage in all legitimate ways the employment of women in occupations involving great physical exertion, and should especially so respect his wife in the eyes and to the knowledge of the whole of the people among whom he lives, that his example may be to them a constant lesson in Christian civilization. The West Coast of Africa has advantages that no other countries emerging from barbarism ever enjoyed. Owing to the facilities of communication by steam, and the activity of an enterprising commerce, with weekly communication between it and the great centres of advanced European civilization, it is brought into immediate contact with every improving and ennobling influence that Christianity, learning, and science have gradually, and only during the tedious course of centuries, bestowed and developed. It comes into immediate contact with these in the full vigour of their maturity, benefiting by all the great intellects that have helped in the work of human enlightenment and progress. We are justified, then, in expecting from the educated in African communities under British inspection and rule, at the present day, a rate of advancement unexampled in the history of mankind. The hand of British Christian philanthropy has been liberally and unreservedly extended toward them (witness the efforts of the great missionary societies), and effected among them in a few years that which, if they had been left to their own unaided efforts, would have been the work of centuries, if even ever achieved. It is their bounden duty, then, as well as to their interest, to assist the British authorities in every possible way to cleanse the communities in which they live and have influence from all the filth and abominations of that debased barbarism out of which they have themselves been so happily extricated; and we expect from those of Lagos in this matter of disgusting and poisonous food, as well as from those of other towns in the matter of general cleanliness, an energetic assistance of the authorities, by hunting out and bringing to light, and helping to put an end to every lurking abomination of heathen ignorance, poverty, and barbarism.

We could not marvel, because, as described to us, it is a place under the tropics—a mere sandbank in the lagoon, opposite the River Ogun, rising very little above the water's edge—was overgrown in the unpeopled part with a rank vegetation, luxuriating and decaying in something very like a morass; and the inhabited portion was reeking with filthy and pestilential odours. And now, mark well, in this place, which had with justice obtained so deadly a reputation, only one European died during the last twelve months, out of about a hundred, while native deaths were also wonderfully diminished in number. This statement was made in a letter which we published last month, and which came to us from a source which justifies us in believing its statements. And to what is this happy change owing? Has Lagos turned out of the tropics, or been elevated by some natural convulsion so as to bring her into a more vigorous atmosphere; or has decaying vegetation ceased to produce pestilential miasma owing to some secative change, and from the same cause other filth become inoffensive? Nothing of the sort, of course. Lagos has had the good fortune to be under the administration of a man who did not like to see his fellow-creatures and countrymen die around him like rotten sheep—a man with energy of character, who was convinced that Lagos could be made habitable, and who steadily and persistently set about making her so. We have differed with Administrator Glover's policy on many occasions as regards the main land, with its energetic, cultivating, and trading people, and had occasionally to find fault with him in other respects, but we have never failed to give him a high meed of praise for his administrative abilities. He has not been a Roi fainéant, like most of the West African administrators, indifferent to the moral and social progress, the material improvement and commercial development of the settlement under his charge; but has honestly and patiently laboured to bring about changes, which, in some instances, grievously offended the native prejudices, but which were indispensable to the obtaining results such as we have been commenting upon. With the exception of Bathurst, Lagos was naturally one of the most unfavourable of spots for successful results to sanitary reforms, and yet see what has been accomplished. We are ashamed for British rule when we hear of continued insalubrity at Cape Coast, Accra, and other places under British authority on the Coast of Guinea. When shall we have administrators there who will form a proper estimate of the value of human life, and seek to preserve it by removing the causes of disease which prove so often fatal to it? Captain John Hawley Glover, R.N., Administrator of Lagos, has been really the first West African sanitary reformer with sound and comprehensive views, and knows how to act with conciliation as well as with persistent energy and firmness. All honour to him. He has made Lagos habitable, and now he is lighting, as well as striving to enlighten her. Street lamps in Lagos! Look at that, ye old slave-traders, who may still be brooding over past atrocities of your unholy traffic. Lamps in Lagos! We anticipate great results on the interior from Lagos example. This has been our cry from the very day that Lagos was annexed and became a British settlement. We said it was her mission to bring a reflection of European and Christian civilisation home to the very borders of the Egba and Yoruba countries. Civilisation is catching; and we now look forward with even more than former confidence to great and widespread results in those countries, which will undoubtedly become the richest, as they are by far the most enterprising, portion of native West Africa."", 'last_edit_date': '1870-01-24', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_01_1870#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sanitariums for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'M\'Carthy\'s Island, River Gambia, Dec. 20, 1864.\n\nMy Lord,—In the editorial article in the Lancet of October 13, page 442, we find the remark that ""it is a singular fact in medical geography that from St. Louis, Senegal, on the north, to Mossamedes, on the south, there is not upon the seaboard a single healthy acre of ground. The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of West Africa—Gold Mining—The Labour Question', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It is a remarkable fact that the Spaniards, Portuguese, and Frenchmen who live on the Coast, and who, as a general rule, live far less liberally than do the residents who are natives of the United Kingdom or America, show a much larger sick list and a much higher death rate than the men of the Anglo-Saxon race. It is generally agreed that this is to be attributed to our superior mode of living, for the Spaniards, Portuguese, and Frenchmen are generally as hardy and as strong as we are.\n\nThe Chairman advised Europeans to adopt a diet of ""rice, weak tea, and mild tobacco."" Well, any white man who went in for such a diet should be either made of cast iron—if such a being could be manufactured—or else must be an idiotic candidate for a suicide\'s grave. Why, Kroomen cannot exist continually on rice; their diet has to be changed, in their own country, to corn, and, in factories down the Coast, to biscuit, with a free allowance of beef. A twelvemonth\'s diet of rice produces in most Kroomen valvular disease of the heart, with dropsy of the extremities and abdomen, and if the case is not treated at once, on the first signs of swelling in the feet, by change of diet, with medicine, death follows in a few days. Perhaps the Chairman can stand a diet that will kill a Krooman?\n\nWith regard to longevity of life in Africa, and the time a man can stay out without change of climate, much depends on where he resides. In Gambia, men have resided seven years at a time without leaving the place. On the Southwest Coast, men like Mr. Walker have resided three or more years without going to Europe or Madeira; while in the Bights three years is a long spell—eighteen months to two years being about the average time. Then a man, if he is even not very ill, feels the climate has so tried him that a few months\' change to the north is absolutely necessary. The same rule applies to the Gold, Ivory, and Grain Coasts. But it is more than likely that on elevated ground, say fifty miles up the country, on these coasts, like the station of the Swiss Mission, near Ackra, that men could reside in very decent health for much longer periods, provided they have good food—fresh food, not tinned.\n\nHalf the mortality in the towns of the Gold Coast is caused by want of proper sanitation. Where every native yard is a private cemetery, where in such yards cesspools, years old, are the rule, and the ground is saturated with sewage, where water has to be stored in tanks, and is bad—how can the towns be healthy, under a tropical sun? With any quantity of land in the neigh\n\nhood of such towns, there is no public cemetery for the natives. With the towns elevated above the sea, and washed by the surf of the Atlantic, there is no attempt at proper drainage, and the removal of sewage to the sea.

But we have been subject to such misrepresentations when combating stereotyped misstatements as regards West Africa, that we will not allow any one to misunderstand us. The opinions we put forward with regard to the climate of West Africa have not been hastily or crudely formed, nor have they been adopted to serve some temporary or interested purpose. They are the result of evidence that cannot be disproved. They are promulgated by us to remove prejudices which war against our efforts for the advancement of civilization in Africa, and because we feel that they are pregnant with most practical results. We do not, for instance, pretend that the West African climate is not unhealthy. We admit that it is. But we as fearlessly contend that it is not one whit more unhealthy for Europeans than many of the West India Islands, or than Hong Kong, China, or India, &c. These regions are equally liable to visitations of epidemic disease as is West Africa, in the shape of yellow fever, dysentery, &c. We are, moreover, firmly convinced that if ever the day arrives when complete, and not mere partial statistical tables, are compiled, showing the mortality amongst Europeans at the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and even the new settlement at Lagos, the facts fairly and impartially revealed will demonstrate that at least a moiety of the deaths which occur amongst them are not the result of climatic disease, but are chargeable occasionally to accident; more frequently to a lamentable and wanton neglect of ordinary care and precautions; and too often to reckless indulgences, which will in any climate sap the springs of life, and ultimately destroy it. As additional evidences in support of these statements, take, for example, the records with regard to the numerous governors who have served, or are now serving, in West Africa. We find that in most instances they were and are men who had passed middle life before being called upon to administer those Governments, and were consequently far less able to bear up against attacks of fever. Yet, of the thirty-four gentlemen who have governed Sierra Leone from 1792 to 1864, seven only died there in that long period of seventy-two years. Of those seven, one was killed in action, another veteran most unwisely made fruit and vegetables his sole diet; and one of them had previously lived upwards of thirty-five years in the colony, dying at sea, not of disease incident to the climate, but of cancer of the stomach.

Nor do you make any distinction between the colonies, classing Sierra Leone with Lagos, Gambia, and Cape Coast, which I am sure the facts would not warrant.\n\nTo revert, however, to the causes of mortality on the West Coast of Africa, I am of opinion that there are many influential causes conducing to the same which might be prevented, and I take the liberty of intruding on your valuable space to enumerate one or two of them.\n\n1. The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics.

There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years.

I had heard and read so much of its unhealthiness that I had pictured to myself a low-lying swampy coast, fringed with mangrove bushes, and with the other accompaniments of a malarial climate. This imaginary sketch bore not the slightest resemblance to the truth. In the place of a flat, low-lying district I found a mountainous tract of country, formed by two rivers which nearly intersect it. The general appearance of this Sierra is picturesque in the extreme. The sky line is broken by the irregular outline of a number of conical peaks, covered to their summits with lofty forests, which give to the distant scenery a rich and romantic appearance. Freetown is situated on the shore of a beautiful bay, hemmed in by a grand amphitheatre of hills, covered with vegetation. The distance between the town and the base of the mountains varies from three-quarters of a mile to a mile and a half, the intervening space being broken by numerous grass-clad undulations.\n\nHills ascend almost in regular gradation until they reach the highest peak, and as they are well wooded, the *coup d'œil* is striking and beautiful. A fairer situation for a town can scarcely be imagined, and if the sad experience of the past did not teach us the contrary, it would be pronounced healthy. There is no room to doubt, however, that Sierra Leone is extremely unhealthy, and epidemics of fever occur from time to time which sweep off large numbers of the population. This fever is peculiarly deadly to Europeans, and at the time when there was a European garrison the mortality was immense, whole families being occasionally carried off during one visitation. Happily, few Europeans are now sent to this deadly climate, and the number is yearly decreasing. At the census of 1881 there were only 160 resident whites in the whole of Sierra Leone.

This advantage they do not enjoy in the West Indies, private practice being in the hands of the civil medical practitioners. That the emoluments from this source are considerable, may be judged of by the fact that the late colonial surgeon of Sierra Leone is understood to have realised the handsome sum of 20,000l., and the yearly income of the present colonial surgeon of that colony from official and private practice is, as has been stated by himself and friends, 1,200l. or 1,500l. per annum.

Smith and Spilsberry being far advanced medical students at King's College, and the appointment to staff-assistant-surgeoncies of Drs. Davis and Horton is a proof that the Government is alive to the advantages of having coloured medical officers attached to the regiments stationed in West Africa.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals.

The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome.

This chapter seeks to examine the nature and major characteristic of these economies.\nThe British, like other colonizers, did not develop a universal theory of colonialism which could embrace all aspects of life in all colonies. Nor did they develop anything near a universal practice of colonialism. Indeed this was impossible as colonialism was imposed on peoples with extremely diverse cultures and backgrounds, and living in widely differing environ› ments. Much was left to the administrators to deal with situations depend› ing on the local conditions. Even in the absence of a clear theory, however, a critical examination of colonial relations brings to light some fundamental assumptions which seem to have acted as guidelines for both the framers and implementers of colonial economic policies. First, the colonies were expected to provide raw materials (agricultural products and minerals) to feed the machines of the industrial imperial power. Second, the colonies had to import manufactured goods from the imperial power. These two assumptions divided the empire into two distinct economic camps - the colonies and the metropolis. Significantly there was very little reciprocity in the relationship. While in most cases the colonies had an obligation to export to Britain before they could consider any other buyer, even if such a buyer would pay higher prices, Britain had no obligation to import exclusively from any of her colonies. She operated through rational econo› mic choices and bought from whoever sold at low prices. The colonized people were also at a disadvantage in the import trade. In some cases they had to buy expensive British manufactures as the colonial state apparatus, under pressure from Britain, raised customs duties for non-British goods. Third, the colonies had to be self-supporting. The colonized peoples had to raise revenue for the general administration and for whatever limited development projects that were undertaken.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.58, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': 'The outcome of the Scramble and partition for Liberia and Ethiopia', 'content': ""But if Liberia and Ethiopia did survive, the former did so mutilated and emaciated, and this was the outcome of her military weakness and the hopeless internal conditions of the state.

By 1880 it was divided into four regiments - one stationed in each county - each under an Americo-Liberian commander subordinated to the Liberian president, the army's commander-in-chief. 87 The typical condition of the militia was portrayed in President Barclay's description of its Fifth Regiment in May 1906 as: 'unsatisfactory: Colonel Carter, its commander, being also a preacher and absent constantly; the Lieutenant Colonel being illiterate; the major being deaf; the Regiment is rapidly going down and must be reconstructed'.$^{88}$ The LFF, no less inefficient than the militia, comprised in December 1913 three American and seven Liberian officers and over 600 enlisted men stationed in over a dozen detachments in the Liberian hinterland. Up to 1914, the officer commanding each detachment performed both military and administrative duties in his district. Consequently he received instructions from, and reported to both the Department of War and the Department of Interior (neither of which co-ordinated with the other). Liberia's military weakness markedly contrasted with Ethiopia's military might and largely accounted for Liberia's inability to defend her territory from encroachment by Europeans during the Scramble."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.589, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""The difficulty was that subsistence farmers had few needs and often felt that regular employment savoured of slavery$^{5 6}$ and that these tasks were women's work.$^{57}$ Europeans, frustrated by seeing large profits slipping away from them, had little sympathy with such attitudes: 'fear had to take the place of ambition or covetousness as the motive sentiment inducing them to labour'.$^{58}$ The solutions were primitive and often brutal. For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work.

In some areas labour was recruited from overseas, such as the importation of Indians to build the Mombasa-Uganda railway at the beginning of the present century and to cultivate sugar in Natal from as early as i860.

Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

With this dictum in mind, all the European powers utilized in their military establishments elements recruited from the indigenous population. Although organization and effectiveness varied both according to region and particular national purposes, such colonial troops primarily performed police functions in the inter-war era and were joined by newly created constabulary forces in this capacity. Yet because they were frequently made to serve in geographical regions culturally and ethnically unfamiliar to them, African soldiers were thus alienated from their own society and were often received with hostility by the local populations they forcefully encountered. As a result of this condition and, furthermore, of the European denial of command positions to Africans, the army never came to play the political role in the independence movements that its counterparts in Asia and the Near East did.

Most of these nearly 5000 settlers had been sent to the new district of Albany where they held about 40 ha (100 acres) each. Although they may not have realized it, one of the main considerations for the establishment of the Albany settlement, as far as Governor Somerset was concerned, was that the settlers would assist with the defence and stabilization of the notorious Eastern Frontier.\nThe Cape Colony's economic situation and prospects had never been bright. The dangerous military situation on the frontier was simply aggra› vating the economic problems. The 1820 settlers were in a worse situation than the Dutch farmers living in the old districts of the Colony. By 1823, there were already indications that agriculture, expected to be Albany's staple economic activity and the main source of livelihood, was going to be a huge flop. To start with, many of the new farmers were not qualified to do the work for which they had been brought to Africa. There was also a general complaint that the holdings were too small. Then came floods in 1822 that destroyed all the crops. Many farmers had abandoned their land by 1823 and those that still held on had lost their original enthusiasm and were broken in spirit. With the small amounts of capital they had brought from Britain rapidly dwindling, many were either heavily in debt to the government for rations or were facing destitution. Excessive drinking was on the increase as many a broken heart sought to drown its worries and sorrows. 10 With just about a third of the original number of the farmers still on their plots in 1823 and facing formidable odds, the whole future of the Albany settlement as an agricultural venture was highly doubtful.

In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W.

The result is what might be expected; out of a force of 200 men of the 1st West India Regiment who arrived here about the 1st of the month (Tamar troops), there were no less than nineteen admitted to hospital during the first week; whilst the first week of the force of 300 men of the 4th West India Regiment who arrived here before the rains only gave twelve to hospital; there is therefore a difference of seven. This difference gradually increased, and we find in the second week the admittance of the 1st West was twenty-nine, whilst that of the 4th at the former period in the second week was only eighteen. In the third week the proportion was still greater; the admittance in the 4th West in their third week had been only fourteen, whilst the effect of the continuous rains and the consequent pernicious change of the sanitary condition of the camp has been such as to cause the admission of one out of every four men in the camp into hospital—viz., fifty-three—showing that during the first three weeks, of the 300 men of the 4th West India Regiment before the rains there were only forty-four admittances, whilst during the same period, but in a different season, of the 200 men of the 1st West India Regiment there were 101 admitted into hospital.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1864#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.698, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE AFRICAN-AID SOCIETY', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""In consequence of the death and sickness among the 4th West India Regiment at Cape Coast Castle, caused, in a great degree, by the use of very impure water, the Society has urged upon Her Majesty's Government the necessity of some immediate arrangements for supplying a small quantity of pure water daily to the troops at that station, until more effectual measures shall be taken for securing, at all times, to the Castle and town of Cape Coast an abundant supply from natural sources.\n\nThe Society has also recommended such measures as Her Majesty's Government may deem most fitting for encouraging, or preparing for service in West Africa, properly-qualified surgeons of African race, these not being liable to yellow fever, which has occasionally caused the death of so many European surgeons on the Coast."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1864#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE ASHANTEE WAR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'From the position of Prahsoo, it is self-evident that it must be unhealthy, at least for some time to come; and the position of the camp is such as to secure for its inmates the maximum of unhealthiness in the district. It is constructed at the base of a gradual descent; so that when, as of late, it rains very heavily, all around the camp is something like a mud swamp. The bush having been only so lately cleared, the earth which has thus become exposed cannot be expected to exhale anything else but malaria, and therefore it will be contrary to all the rules of hygiene to expect the camp at Prahsoo to be healthy. Its close proximity to the river, although pleasant, tends, of course, to increase the dampness of the encampment. The contrast between the atmosphere during the day and night is too sudden for health, the variation being more than 20 degrees. Whilst the excitement lasted there was very little sickness, but after a residence of sixteen days one, and another, and another, became so dreadfully ill, that the medical officer in charge was obliged to invalid them to the seacoast; so that within eight weeks of their arrival in the bush nearly the whole of the officers left the Prah for Cape Coast in a dreadful state. The troops arrived at the Prah about the 1st February, and on the 8th April, when the Tamar anchored in Cape Coast roadstead, there were fourteen officers of the 4th West at the Castle; and such was their state of health, that at the dinner given to *fête* the arrival of the reinforcement, only one was able to leave his bed and meet them, and even he was in a dreadful state of debility. Out of twenty-six officers who left the Coast for the field, fifteen, or thereabout, have been invalided home, in a very precarious state, three have died, and four are still obliged to keep their bed, though not sufficiently ill to be invalided. Of the soldiers many have died, principally from dysentery. A great many are so weak, that, in all probability, they will not be fit for active service in the field for the next twelve months. Of the twelve medical officers on the Coast, three have been invalided, one has died, and three are still prostrated with fever. Of the soldiers of the detachment of the 1st West India Regiment sent up to Prahsoo on the 24th April, we gather from the report of the medical officer in charge that seventeen were admitted into hospital within three days of their arrival in the camp, and that an average of twenty were daily reported sick. Such, then, is the present position of the troops on the Gold Coast. It is dreadful to both Africans and Europeans; and should the Government intend to have it supplied with troops from the West Indies, it must be prepared to find means of properly rationing them with fresh provisions. It is a great pity to bring a lot of men here to sacrifice their lives; and whenever a lasting peace is proclaimed between our Government and the King of Ashantee, I think it will not be an imprudent act to have the Coast supplied, according to the recommendation of Sir Benjamin Pine, with a strong police constabulary and a small detachment of only about 100 men. The troops on the whole of the West Coast should, I also think, be under the command of a major-general, whose residence should be at Sierra Leone, and the detachment here should be relieved every year. This will be a very great improvement on all sides, both for the officers and men, and the mortality will be by far less than it would be if the men were to be fed continually for three years on salt beef and pork.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-05-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1864#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CLIMATE OF WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Sir,—As you have so kindly drawn attention to the health of the Navy on the West Coast of Africa, may I be permitted to say a word on behalf of the officers of the West India regiments quartered in that pestilential climate?  \nThe 4th West India Regiment has been on the Coast barely three years, during which period they have lost no less than 19 or 20 officers, and many more than that number invalided, a great number of whom have been obliged, through ill-health, to exchange, go on half-pay, or leave the service altogether.  \nThe 3rd West India Regiment, lately sent to Jamaica, lost a great many officers, but I am not positive as to the exact number.

But no; the health of the forces was good from August, 1863, until some three weeks after they had marched in several directions into the bush of the interior. The mortality and sickness has occurred only since the end of February, with few exceptions. The local error committed we deem to have been this: The rains commenced two months before their time. We think that on the very first day of rain, all idea of further duty in the field should have been abandoned, and nearly all the troops have been ordered back to Cape Coast Castle without delay. When once the rains began, no troops could go into Ashantee, and no Ashantees would come into the Territories. Again, the campaign being over, we think the Tamar's men, who would otherwise have been marched up to camp immediately, where there were rations, &c., for fifty or sixty days, ought not to have been landed, there being no adequate accommodation for them.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.717, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

In the Appendix, No. 29, will be found a return exhibiting the mortality of the navy employed on the West African station, and of that on the North American and West Indian station, in the five years from 1857 to 1861, from which it appears, that whilst the North American and West Indian squadron loses on that station an average of 28·26 per 1,000 of its officers and men, the West African squadron loses on an average 31·14 out of the same number. A similar comparison of the mortality amongst the black regiments employed respectively in the West Indies and on the West Coast (Return No. 30, Appendix), shows an average of deaths in the former of 23·92 per 1,000 against 32·19 per 1,000 in the latter. These returns do not certainly establish the objection that, compared with other stations on which our army and navy are called upon to serve, the West Coast of Africa is particularly fatal to life. No detailed information has been obtained respecting the loss by death of civil servants of the Government on the West Coast; but it may be stated that the loss of life from climate amongst this class is by no means large; the facility with which officers of all the services who suffer to any dangerous extent from disease are permitted to return home on sick leave, must operate to diminish considerably the number of fatal cases.\n\nThe expenditure of the Imperial Government for the settlements consists of a small grant in aid of their civil establishments, which averages about 12,000l. a-year, and of the cost of the military establishments required for their protection, an amount which varies with the strength of the force employed.

Who does not recall to mind what made Lagos so fatally pestilential—who does not observe causes similar to those which led to the mortality in the Bristol, and to the late fever outbreak at Bathurst, Gambia? This question of the asserted deadly character of the climate of the West Coast of Africa over and above that of all other tropical or semi-tropical countries, is all-important in our eyes. As in the case of Bermuda, we cannot allow culpable official indifference and neglect at head-quarters—red-tape stupidity with obstinate ignorance in naval and military commanders—and carelessness and inefficiency in governors to decide this question for us! We believe that the West Coast countries contain what, considering their proximity to England, will necessarily make them to rank eventually among the most important possessions of the British Crown; and we cannot silently view our hold on any portion of them relaxed, because of a fever myth sedulously propagated by guilty and interested parties. The climate and the at present social influences are, no doubt, prejudicial to the health of Europeans, but by no means necessarily fatal.

There is considerable sickness during and after the rains; but many of the merchants, finding that their business makes but light demands upon them during that season, are in the habit of passing in England the worst months of the year. Military officers who suffer in health to any considerable extent are at once invalided, and civil officers are afforded every facility for obtaining the advantages of a change of climate: thus not only are very few Europeans compelled to remain in the colony for any length of time without a change, but there is also a consequent diminution in the number of deaths from the effects of the climate.\n\nIt has often been urged that the unhealthiness of the Gambia is largely due to the unfavourable situation of Bathurst, the capital and seat of trade, on the low-lying and swampy Island of St. Mary, and it has been suggested that a great improvement would be effected in this respect by the removal of the seat of government to the more airy and elevated situation of Cape St. Mary.\n\nThere can be no question of the superior healthiness of the Cape, and on this account alone the transfer would be very desirable; but\n\nalthough the government offices might be removed there, it is certain that the merchants would not on this account alone consent to incur the heavy expense of moving their store-houses and long-established places of business from the safe anchorage and convenient landing-places of the river to the exposed situation of St. Mary, which is in no respect so well adapted for the purposes of trade. So long, therefore, as Bathurst remains the seat of trade, it is necessary for its convenience that the custom-house and other public offices connected with it should not be removed from its neighbourhood.\n\nOne cause of the unhealthiness of Bathurst is the existence in the immediate neighbourhood of the town of an offensive and pestilent swamp; but from a recent report of Major Clarke, R.E., it appears that, for the sum of about 7,000£, the whole space, covering nearly 1,000 acres, could be closely and efficiently drained.

1163,"Health challenges and mortality rates for British and West India regiments on the West Coast of Africa were influenced by environmental conditions and deployment duration, challenging assumptions about racial resilience and suggesting biases in the perception of service risks.","The observations from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that health challenges and mortality rates for British and West India regiments on the West Coast of Africa were significantly influenced by environmental conditions and deployment duration, challenging assumptions about racial resilience and suggesting biases in the perception of service risks. The textbook highlights that European soldiers, including British forces, were particularly vulnerable to indigenous diseases, with death rates nine times higher than those of African soldiers, underscoring the critical role of environmental conditions and deployment duration in health outcomes. This vulnerability was exacerbated by Europe's limited medical preparedness for tropical diseases until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, further indicating biases in the perception of service risks. Although the textbook does not specifically mention West India regiments, The African Times articles fill this gap by noting that these regiments, composed of black soldiers, suffered nearly as much from diseases like fever as their European counterparts. The articles emphasize the detrimental impact of environmental factors such as swamps and stagnant water, and the prolonged exposure to these conditions, which increased disease incidence. They also critique the neglect of ordinary care, lack of proper sanitary measures, and excessive alcohol consumption by Europeans, which worsened health outcomes.

The text highlights that Europeans, including British forces, were significantly more susceptible to indigenous diseases in Africa, with death rates among European soldiers being nine times higher than those of African soldiers. This suggests that environmental conditions and the duration of deployment played a crucial role in the health outcomes of these regiments, challenging assumptions about racial resilience. The text also notes that Europe was not well-equipped medically for its African ventures, with limited understanding and treatment options for tropical diseases until the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This lack of preparedness further supports the idea that biases existed in the perception of service risks, as the European forces faced high mortality rates due to unfamiliar diseases and inadequate medical infrastructure.

Furthermore, the articles challenge assumptions about racial resilience by pointing out that West India regiments, despite being composed of black soldiers, suffered nearly as much from fever as their European counterparts.

These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

What was less frequently emphasized by the new regimes was the heavy loss of life arising in parts of Africa from their intervention. The deaths were rarely a product of the original extension of administration, but rather of the suppression of subsequent revolts and of the ensuing punitive expeditions which apparently often inflicted most damage because of starvation resulting from the upsetting of the subsistence farming cycle.

But it was of little value 'in circumstances where survival depended essentially upon the ability of groups with shared resources to reconcile their politics to their economic interests through a fragmented, contradictory process of attack, compromise, and evasion'.$^{14}$ Although this conclusion is intended for the Dawi Mani, it might well apply to the history of many other Saharan societies."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The structure of Volume VII', 'content': 'It will be seen from these chapters that the view that Africans received the invading soldiers with elation and quickly accepted colonial rule is not borne out by the available evidence. In fact, African reactions were the very reverse. It is quite evident that Africans were faced with only two options, either to readily surrender their sovereignty and independence, or to defend them at all costs. It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.\nJohn D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty. To them, there could be no compromise on that, and indeed many of the leaders of these states chose to die on the battlefield, go into voluntary flight or face exile rather than surrender their sovereignty without a struggle.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'The persistence and transformation of African cultural values in Latin America and the Caribbean', 'content': 'The problem of colour distinctions arises in different ways, for, according to Roger Bastide, \'whether the colour line is institutionalized, as in the United States, or not, the result is the same.

Barely ten years after the event, for example, a son might give details of his father's battles which the latter knew nothing about, though, from then on, he would knit them into his account in all good faith. The colonial version, though contemporaneous with the events, is not perfect; it is tainted with the hostility that existed in the armies of the colonial powers between metropolitan and colonial regiments. The officers of the latter did not hesitate to portray their campaigns in Africa in such a way as to make them look comparable to the battles waged in Europe by the former. 5\nThe second influence was nationalist. Operations for conquest were contemporaneous with reformist and nationalist activity in the towns. Even when they were taking place far from the towns, the townspeople eagerly followed their ups and downs and immediately used them for ideological ends. It was often the militant townsman who got the old highland warrior to dictate his recollections.\nFor the two reasons given, the statements we now have cannot transform the colonial account or the nationalist version: but they can throw a different light on them, always provided we go beyond their strictly local setting."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': 'Finally, there was the question of differing African responses to foreign influences.

The roads to it are in many parts covered with swamps and pools of stagnant water, which during the heavy rains present great obstruction to travellers. The camp, in its present condition, on account of the frequent heavy rains which we have had, is nearly under water, with the exception of a few elevated spots. Two days of sunshine after this inundation convert the pools into muddy, pestiferous swamps, breeding that baneful poison which produces the most deleterious effects on the constitution. All the unoccupied ground of the camp is now covered with alga and fungi, emitting the most stinking and deadly vapour, especially when the morning sun falls upon it. The temporary bamboo sheds built by the forces, to be occupied only during the short period they were expected to remain here before they crossed over the Ashantee frontier, on active operations, are, I contend, perfectly insufficient to shelter them from the effects of those pestiferous swamps and of the damp weather of the rainy season. It is therefore no wonder that Prahsoo should now have become a great hospital, instead of a place where officers and men are expected to be in an efficient state to oppose an enemy who will never cross the river, swollen as it is at this season. Even the huts are surrounded by swamps, which defy all the attempts of Lieutenant Roberts at drainage, and through the roofs of most of them the rain pours down as through a sieve. They are consequently wet and most unhealthy. The result is what might be expected; out of a force of 200 men of the 1st West India Regiment who arrived here about the 1st of the month (Tamar troops), there were no less than nineteen admitted to hospital during the first week; whilst the first week of the force of 300 men of the 4th West India Regiment who arrived here before the rains only gave twelve to hospital; there is therefore a difference of seven.

In the third week the proportion was still greater; the admittance in the 4th West in their third week had been only fourteen, whilst the effect of the continuous rains and the consequent pernicious change of the sanitary condition of the camp has been such as to cause the admission of one out of every four men in the camp into hospital—viz., fifty-three—showing that during the first three weeks, of the 300 men of the 4th West India Regiment before the rains there were only forty-four admittances, whilst during the same period, but in a different season, of the 200 men of the 1st West India Regiment there were 101 admitted into hospital.'}, {'id': 639, 'article_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

In the Appendix, No. 29, will be found a return exhibiting the mortality of the navy employed on the West African station, and of that on the North American and West Indian station, in the five years from 1857 to 1861, from which it appears, that whilst the North American and West Indian squadron loses on that station an average of 28·26 per 1,000 of its officers and men, the West African squadron loses on an average 31·14 out of the same number. A similar comparison of the mortality amongst the black regiments employed respectively in the West Indies and on the West Coast (Return No. 30, Appendix), shows an average of deaths in the former of 23·92 per 1,000 against 32·19 per 1,000 in the latter. These returns do not certainly establish the objection that, compared with other stations on which our army and navy are called upon to serve, the West Coast of Africa is particularly fatal to life. No detailed information has been obtained respecting the loss by death of civil servants of the Government on the West Coast; but it may be stated that the loss of life from climate amongst this class is by no means large; the facility with which officers of all the services who suffer to any dangerous extent from disease are permitted to return home on sick leave, must operate to diminish considerably the number of fatal cases.\n\nThe expenditure of the Imperial Government for the settlements consists of a small grant in aid of their civil establishments, which averages about 12,000l. a-year, and of the cost of the military establishments required for their protection, an amount which varies with the strength of the force employed. Recent events on the Gold Coast had caused a considerable increase to be made to this force, but the present appearance of affairs seems to justify its reduction to about its usual strength.'}, {'id': 921, 'article_title': 'Yellow Fever', 'full_section_title': 'Yellow Fever', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_09_1866#article-12', 'issue_date': '22_09_1866', 'content': 'It is with deep sorrow we have recorded the death by yellow fever of seven Europeans at Bathurst, River Gambia. Seven deaths, in the course we believe of three or four days, out of a European population of at most some thirty or forty! There is this fever peculiarity on the West Coast of Africa, that whenever the common fevers are very virulent among the natives, yellow fever attacks Europeans. And this type of disease seems unhappily to have lost none of its fatal power in that part of the world. The _Times_ has lately indulged in a furious sanitary leader against the West Coast, and inserted numerous letters _apropos_ of the mortality by yellow fever on board Her Majesty’s ship Bristol.* A great amount of nonsense has in this case been mixed up with the unhappy truth of nearly thirty deaths in the course of a few months among the officers and crew of that ill-fated vessel. If the loud denouncers of service on the African Coast, because of these deaths, had consulted the statistics of the Navy for some years past, they would have found that the mortality has been by no means the greatest on the West Coast of Africa—that there are other naval stations on which the death-rate is higher. We do not, however, hear it proposed that those stations should therefore be given up; it is only as regards the West Coast of Africa that such abandonment of national duty is urged. It is unhappily fashionable at the present time to attack Africa and the Africans. A leading article of the _Daily Telegraph_, on occasion of the bestowal of a knighthood on Sir Edward Baker, lately returned from the sources of the Nile, might be adduced as additional evidence of this fact. We do not deny the stated disgusting and horrible barbarism and cruel superstition of the mass of the native Africans, whether on the coast or in the interior; we do not deny that there are diseases prevalent there which make the countries so dangerous to Europeans as to exact from them, if they have any regard for their lives, extreme care and prudence, and recourse to the best means of prevention and cure. But we do say that the deeper, the more intense, the more disgusting and horrifying the barbarism and superstition may be, the greater the duty of Christian England to endeavour by the diffusion of Christian truth to mitigate those horrors; and we do also affirm, that the African diseases, including the occasional yellow fever, have not necessarily that fatal character which is attributed to them. The mortality on board the Bristol, if not owing (as in some previously notorious cases) to an abominable source of infection in the ship itself, must have had some recognisable cause or causes. A rigid inquiry seems to us to be necessary, not only as to the original outbreak of the fever among the crew, but as to the means of prevention and cure adopted. If we are not misinformed, it would be found that the mortality has been chiefly among men who were most injudiciously and improperly exposed to excessive labour under a tropical sun, immediately after their arrival from England, and while yellow fever was known to be about. No such case of mortality as this of the crew of the Bristol ought to remain uninquired into. It is easy to cover fatal and most condemnable errors by a denunciation of climate. We should like, alas! to know what was the course of medical treatment adopted on board the Bristol, and what among those who have died at Bathurst? Yellow fever, like cholera, is one of those malignant forms of disease that do not admit of being trifled with. The old system of treatment of yellow fever was one under which to be attacked was almost to have the death-warrant signed for the unhappy sufferer; and a persistence at the present day in such system gives necessarily pretty similar results. But if under that system so few recoveries take place, why are there not imperative orders from the Admiralty and the Colonial Offices, that in all outbreaks of the yellow fever, the _saline treatment_, recommended by Dr. Stevens, under which almost all yellow fever patients are said to have recovered in the West Indies—why, we say, are there not imperative orders that his system should be tried? These are not the days in which the lives of our officers and sailors and Government _employés_ ought to be allowed to be trifled with. Every discovery of modern science ought to be at their command for their use and service, or science may, so far as they are concerned, shut up shop at once. We insist upon this point.

This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it.

This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sickness and Death among the Gold Coast Troops', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""are said not to be made with rosewater, campaigns in unhealthy tropical climates can never be as harmless as picnic parties.

But no; the health of the forces was good from August, 1863, until some three weeks after they had marched in several directions into the bush of the interior. The mortality and sickness has occurred only since the end of February, with few exceptions. The local error committed we deem to have been this: The rains commenced two months before their time. We think that on the very first day of rain, all idea of further duty in the field should have been abandoned, and nearly all the troops have been ordered back to Cape Coast Castle without delay. When once the rains began, no troops could go into Ashantee, and no Ashantees would come into the Territories. Again, the campaign being over, we think the Tamar's men, who would otherwise have been marched up to camp immediately, where there were rations, &c., for fifty or sixty days, ought not to have been landed, there being no adequate accommodation for them. But the great sickness and death was not among these men, but among those who had been at Prahsoo and other up-country stations.\n\nWe hope that now the party battle has been fought, men will reason calmly about events which, though deplorable, have not the gravity that has been attributed to them.

It must be acknowledged that the absence of inventive resources to meet emergencies in campaign, which peculiarly characterises our troops, greatly increases the difficulties of Government, and leads frequently to disease and death that might have been very easily averted."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1864#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The (Colony of the)', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'This position altogether is so far clear. But we have been subject to such misrepresentations when combating stereotyped misstatements as regards West Africa, that we will not allow any one to misunderstand us. The opinions we put forward with regard to the climate of West Africa have not been hastily or crudely formed, nor have they been adopted to serve some temporary or interested purpose. They are the result of evidence that cannot be disproved. They are promulgated by us to remove prejudices which war against our efforts for the advancement of civilization in Africa, and because we feel that they are pregnant with most practical results. We do not, for instance, pretend that the West African climate is not unhealthy. We admit that it is. But we as fearlessly contend that it is not one whit more unhealthy for Europeans than many of the West India Islands, or than Hong Kong, China, or India, &c. These regions are equally liable to visitations of epidemic disease as is West Africa, in the shape of yellow fever, dysentery, &c. We are, moreover, firmly convinced that if ever the day arrives when complete, and not mere partial statistical tables, are compiled, showing the mortality amongst Europeans at the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and even the new settlement at Lagos, the facts fairly and impartially revealed will demonstrate that at least a moiety of the deaths which occur amongst them are not the result of climatic disease, but are chargeable occasionally to accident; more frequently to a lamentable and wanton neglect of ordinary care and precautions; and too often to reckless indulgences, which will in any climate sap the springs of life, and ultimately destroy it. As additional evidences in support of these statements, take, for example, the records with regard to the numerous governors who have served, or are now serving, in West Africa. We find that in most instances they were and are men who had passed middle life before being called upon to administer those Governments, and were consequently far less able to bear up against attacks of fever. Yet, of the thirty-four gentlemen who have governed Sierra Leone from 1792 to 1864, seven only died there in that long period of seventy-two years. Of those seven, one was killed in action, another veteran most unwisely made fruit and vegetables his sole diet; and one of them had previously lived upwards of thirty-five years in the colony, dying at sea, not of disease incident to the climate, but of cancer of the stomach.

It is true that some of the officials that had been sent to the Gambia suffered much on account of the climate, but many of them (without disrespect) took advantage of the unfavourable report of the West Coast. We saw in the African Times of May 23rd, 1873, that Mr. Quin and others had an interview with the Earl of Kimberley about the affairs on the West Coast, but we were surprised to see that the Administrator, O\'Callaghan, ""had been compelled by ill health to resign."" We admit that Colonel Anton\'s health was totally ruined, which was the cause of his death; but if the life he led there had been closely watched, the authorities would not have come to the conclusion that he was affected by the climate. When the Administrator arrived here and saw the defenceless state of the Gambia, he thought of organizing a kind of Volunteer force; but this was without success. In fact, Mrs. O\'Callaghan was so very much dissatisfied and frightened at the place, that she would be extremely alarmed on hearing the report of a gun, and even the rumbling of carriage wheels. We were very much dissatisfied when we heard that his Excellency, who was stouter than when he entered the Gambia, was ordered home because of ill health, not knowing that he was looking out for another post. He even promised that he would report the state of the settlement on his arrival in England, that measures might be taken to rectify every defect in the place. We could show many instances to prove that our climate is not so unhealthy that Europeans could not live twenty-eight, thirty, forty-four, and even fifty-five years in it. Messrs. Goddard, Brown, Robertson, Chown, Quin, and Chief Justice Mantell are living testimonies of this settlement. The first of these gentlemen was a merchant who amassed a fortune; he lived in Bathurst a period of about fifty-five years, returned home, and died at the age of seventy-eight. The second, who is now in Bathurst, carrying on an extensive business, has been here for forty-four years, and his health, we venture to say, is improving every day. The third, who was the Colonial Surgeon and afterwards Secretary, resided in this settlement for thirty years, and has now retired to Scotland. The fourth, who was a merchant, took a residence in this place for twenty-five years, and returned home with a fortune. The fifth was of the same calling, resided here for the space of twenty-two years, made his fortune, and has taken his abode in England. The Chief Justice, also, stationed in this colony for twenty-eight years, is now holding a situation as a magistrate in England. Lawyer Montague, Smith and others are living testimonies of ""unhealthy"" Sierra Leone. There are others who might have been testimonies on behalf of the West Coast, but many of them died accidentally. We may therefore come to the conclusion that the climate on the West Coast is not altogether unhealthy.

Who does not recall to mind what made Lagos so fatally pestilential—who does not observe causes similar to those which led to the mortality in the Bristol, and to the late fever outbreak at Bathurst, Gambia? This question of the asserted deadly character of the climate of the West Coast of Africa over and above that of all other tropical or semi-tropical countries, is all-important in our eyes.

We believe that the West Coast countries contain what, considering their proximity to England, will necessarily make them to rank eventually among the most important possessions of the British Crown; and we cannot silently view our hold on any portion of them relaxed, because of a fever myth sedulously propagated by guilty and interested parties.

With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'West Coast Climate—Yellow Fever—Army and Navy Mismanagement', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'So furious has been the attempt to ""taboo"" or ""put down"" the West Coast of Africa because of its climate, that we have no option but to return to the subject.

Yes, here is new evidence of the fact, that the denunciations hurled by the families of victims, and by journalists ignorant in these matters, upon the climate of certain portions of the globe under British rule or power, in which British soldiers, sailors, and civilians have to serve, ought rather to be heaped on the authorities who so unnecessarily and wantonly sacrifice the lives of their fellow-subjects and fellow-servants.

That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence.

The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics.

1164,"The severe environmental conditions and diseases in Africa significantly deteriorated the health of colonial forces, leading to high mortality rates and frequent medical evacuations.","The observations from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that severe environmental conditions and diseases in Africa significantly deteriorated the health of colonial forces, leading to high mortality rates and frequent medical evacuations. The textbook highlights that European soldiers were particularly vulnerable to indigenous diseases, with early 19th-century British West African forces experiencing death rates nine times higher among European soldiers compared to African soldiers. This underscores the severe impact of the unfamiliar and harsh disease environment on European colonial forces. The late development of medical knowledge and treatments for tropical diseases, with significant advancements only occurring from the 1920s onwards, further contributed to these high mortality rates. The establishment of tropical medical schools in Europe and Africa in the late 19th and early 20th centuries indicates an acknowledgment of these health challenges. However, the textbook does not explicitly mention frequent medical evacuations. In contrast, The African Times articles provide substantial evidence of frequent medical evacuations, describing the prevalence of diseases such as dysentery, fever, and smallpox, which led to high numbers of hospitalizations and deaths. For example, one article notes that 100 out of 200 men in a camp were hospitalized due to acute dysentery, diarrhea, rheumatism, and fever. The articles also highlight the impact of poor nutrition, inadequate medical supplies, and adverse climatic conditions, such as the malarious West Coast, on the troops.

Despite these nuances, both sources align in illustrating how environmental conditions and diseases severely impacted the health and operational capacity of colonial forces in Africa.","The paragraphs from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook provide several details that support the claim that severe environmental conditions and diseases in Africa significantly deteriorated the health of colonial forces, leading to high mortality rates. The text mentions that Europeans were more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, with early 19th-century British West African forces experiencing death rates nine times higher among European soldiers compared to African soldiers. This suggests that the unfamiliar and harsh disease environment in Africa had a severe impact on European colonial forces. Additionally, the text highlights the late development of medical knowledge and treatments for tropical diseases, with significant advancements only occurring from the 1920s onwards. This lack of medical preparedness would have contributed to the high mortality rates and possibly frequent medical evacuations among colonial forces. Furthermore, the establishment of tropical medical schools in Europe and Africa in the late 19th and early 20th centuries indicates an acknowledgment of the need to address these health challenges. However, the text does not explicitly mention frequent medical evacuations, which is a difference from the claim. Overall, the textbook supports the claim regarding high mortality rates due to environmental conditions and diseases but does not provide specific details on medical evacuations.","The African Times news articles provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that severe environmental conditions and diseases in Africa significantly deteriorated the health of colonial forces, leading to high mortality rates and frequent medical evacuations. The articles describe the prevalence of diseases such as dysentery, fever, and smallpox, which afflicted both soldiers and civilians, resulting in high numbers of hospitalizations and deaths. For instance, one article notes that 100 out of 200 men in a camp were hospitalized, primarily due to acute dysentery, diarrhea, rheumatism, and fever. The articles also highlight the impact of poor nutrition and inadequate medical supplies, such as the need for large quantities of quinine to treat malaria. Furthermore, the reports mention the adverse effects of the climate, with references to the malarious conditions of the West Coast and the challenges faced by troops due to the lack of proper sanitary measures. The high mortality rates among officers and the frequent invalidation of personnel back to the coast or home for medical treatment further corroborate the claim. However, some articles argue that the mortality rates are not solely due to climatic conditions but also to neglect of personal care and excessive alcohol consumption.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered.

Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.718, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""However, the development which probably had the earliest impact on the mortality level was the penetration of the roads and railways. By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths. From 50 to 80 per cent have or have had syphilis or yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm,"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo* Basin and Angola', 'section_title': 'Demography, society and politics in high-density areas', 'content': ""The development of more-complex agricultural communities had import› ant consequences for the demography of Central Africa. It is generally considered that communities that gradually take up agriculture and animal husbandry continue for a long time to show a low annual growth rate (between 0.05 and 0.10 per cent), which is fairly close to the known growth rate of hunting and food-gathering communities. On the other hand, communities with a more diversified agriculture have a much higher annual growth rate, put between 0.10 and 0.15 per cent. Figures for a difficult natural environment like that of Africa are unknown: but they are no doubt not very far from this model. Spread over more than two centuries, an increase of this order in the growth rate would have had a considerable effect on the overall population of Central Africa. 6\nCompared with twentieth-century growth rates these figures admittedly seem low. The fact is that in early African communities the death rate remained high. For the nineteenth century the main causes of death are known, but it is impossible to determine the extent of each one's con› tribution to the total.\nFirst, there were historical factors, especially the slave trade and its attendant violence. While the manpower drain of the slave trade to America was sharply reduced as from the 1850s, the Swahili and Arab trade took over to the east and north of our area. Figures can be given of overall losses for the whole of Central Africa,$^{7}$ but it is unlikely that it will ever be possible to give a geographical breakdown, especially as the continual movement of groups and individuals spread the impact of the slave trade far and wide.\nThere were also ecological and epidemiological factors. The nineteenth century certainly saw the beginnings of medical progress in Central Africa, such as better knowledge of endemic diseases, use of vaccination and more general use of quinine. But this progress remained confined to the circles visited by traders from Angola or the Swahili coast.

Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

From about 1890 concessionaires were given the whole produce of the land in vast areas of the Free State, while the system was supplemented by the creation of Leopold's Domaine PrivØ from 1892. Within a decade the system had spread to the other two areas and remained intact until almost the First World War. Indeed AndrØ Gide found substantial remnants in the late 1920s. 69 Great similarities existed in each of the systems. The Africans discovered that they no longer owned even their accumulated ivory and that they had to kill elephants for more ivory and scour the forest for rubber. Some of the most callous riffraff of Europe drifted in to become agents for the concessionaires, and to an extraordinary degree they were permitted to utilize the apparatus of the colonial administration including its army, police and courts. Taxation and compulsory labour, although in theory limited, were reinterpreted by the agents to mean such continuous work that crop planting and, consequently, diet suffered very considerably. The population grew reluctant to toil collecting, and to hand over what had always been communally theirs. Imprisonment was an unsatisfactory punishment as it reduced the available labour. Instead, floggings, mutila› tion, the taking as hostages of women and children, the burning of villages and a considerable amount of killing were employed.

In those parts of Africa where Africans were not allowed to grow cash crops such as Kenya and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), as Colin Leys has shown, 'within the space of a generation they had effectively been converted from independent peasants, producing cash crops for the new markets, into peasants dependent on agricultural wage-labour'. 27 Sixthly, the commercialization of land already referred to led to the illegal sale of communal lands by unscrupulous family-heads and to increasing litigation over land which caused widespread poverty especially among the ruling houses. In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A fragile population emerging from near stability', 'content': ""Confining our attention to the area outside the low fertility zone, we can hazard some reasonably good guesses about pre-modern sub-Saharan populations by employing stable population methods of analysis. '$^{7}$ But first two problematic issues should be noted. One is the birth rate, which is most unlikely ever to have been higher than its present level. It may have remained constant, as the evidence of the age structure recorded over fifty years by the censuses of the Gold Coast and Ghana suggest.

The other is the possibility that the population has not been stationary, but has been averaging a rate of growth of up to 0.5 per cent per annum for several centuries (for reasons which will be discussed below). The full range of possibilities allows us to describe a society where women averaged 5.5-7 live births yielding a birth rate of 42-50 per thousand, and where the expectation of life at birth was 20-30 years yielding a death rate of 38-50 per thousand and an infant mortality rate of 250-375 deaths per thousand live births. A medium assumption might be a situation where women averaged little more than six live births, where population growth averaged 0.33 per cent, where the expectation of life at birth was about 22.5 years (about the level of Rome at the end of the Republic)$^{20}$ and where the crude birth rate was about 48 per thousand, the crude death rate 45 per thousand and the infant mortality rate 300-350 per thousand.

Commerce was one, although whether such activities brought prosperity and the ability to buy food in times of need and perhaps some health care in the few places where it existed to a greater degree than it brought disease arising from increased contact with strangers is debatable. By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent. There were two reasons for the trade: firstly that alcohol could be produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits; secondly, in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, there were real problems about what goods would be accepted in return for the produce of Africa.$^{43}$ Mary Kingsley found the trade spirit pure and likely to do less harm than cannabis,$^{44}$ a view shared by a committee that investigated the liquor trade in içoç.$^{45}$ Spirits were distributed on a huge scale, frequently as wages.

It is more difficult, but perhaps not impossible, to imagine that the level of disease (venereal disease and other infections) generated during this period still resulted in a high level of female sterility half a century or more afterwards.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade.

Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927.

It might be worth while for officers to provide themselves with a small respirator, to be worn when exposed to the night air.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '2. The want of proper sanitary measures is another reason why the climate of West Africa proves fatal to many European constitutions. When streets and yards, both back and front of houses, are made the receptacles of filth and excrement, of putrified remains of dead dogs, cats, and other animal and vegetable matter, is it to be wondered at that the miasma rising from these dung-heaps eventually becomes fatal to those constantly inhaling it. This is a cause which it would be well for the colonial authorities here to take into their serious consideration, as it is most certainly a preventible one. It was only in 1871, during the administration of Mr. J. Pope Hennessy, that the sanitary condition of Freetown seriously occupied the attention of the Government; but whether that gentleman’s plans have ever been efficiently carried out, and what effects they have hitherto had there, we have no means here to ascertain.\n\n3. The Europeans on the West Coast of Africa, unlike their countrymen in India, South America, and elsewhere, perhaps for the reasons I have already stated, are so careless of their personal comfort, and so intent upon accumulating as much money as they can, that they deny themselves every convenience necessary in a tropical climate. In Sierra Leone, for instance, they live in the town, which is at the sea-shore, instead of on the mountains, where they would enjoy the sea breezes equally as well, and be in a cooler and healthier atmosphere. In support of this view, I will only quote a passage which occurs in a paper read by Mr. Hennessy before the Society of Arts in April, 1873, in which he says: “The mountain district (of Sierra Leone), according to the Registrar-General’s Returns, appears to be as healthy as any part of England, or indeed as Madeira, the climate of which it closely resembles.”\n\nI hope I have clearly shown that the large mortality on the West Coast of Africa is not entirely due to climatic influences, and that a great deal could be done by the Government and the Europeans to counteract and mitigate those influences. As living proofs of what I have stated, I beg to point out Mr. Magnus Smith, Mr. A. Montagu, Mr. Marston, and half-a-dozen others, who have resided in Sierra Leone for fifteen or twenty years without meeting with the same fate as their countrymen, and simply because they have known how to live.—I am, dear Sir,', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dreadful Ravages of Cholera at Zanzibar, East Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dr. Kirk, in a letter from Zanzibar, dated February 7, 1870, says: ""There died here in this town alone upwards of 10,000 in one month and a half, and 30,000 in the whole island; now it rages up and down the coast.

It was a most distressing sight to witness the arrival of these poor creatures; and it is necessary to make a few preliminary remarks in order clearly to understand the difficulties with which the medical officers had to contend. The appearance of the slaves when landed was most striking. In some the expression of the countenance indicated sufferings, moral and physical, of the most profound and agonising nature. Others of them gazed vacantly around them in the most utter helplessness. Occasionally, among the newly-arrived groups all sense of suffering was merged in melancholic or raving madness. The wizened, shrunk, and skinny features were lighted up by the hollow, feverish eye. The belly was, as it were, tacked to the back, whilst the hip-bones protruded, and, in some cases, became the seat of foul, sloughing ulcers. The hand and skinny fingers seemed much elongated by the great and neglected growth of the nails, and they were so deplorably emaciated, that the skin appeared tensely stretched over, and tied down to the skeleton. The legs refused to perform their functions, and they reeled and tottered about from sheer debility. Their squalor and extreme wretchedness was heightened, in many cases, by the particoloured evacuations with which their bodies were besmeared. When large numbers of the sick were suffering from dysentery, the condition of the wards and yards in the morning was extremely loathsome. This was in a great degree unavoidable, as the sick were too weak to crawl from their mats to the commode, although everything was done under the surgeons\' orders to keep the wards as clean and wholesome as the crowded state of the hospital would admit of."" In a word, ""the moral and physical causes of depression were often so overwhelming, and so intensely concentrated, that the combination produced disease in such formidable shapes as to be beyond remedy. The mortality was consequently very great; many persons brought to the hospital in the last stage of disease died a few hours after their arrival; others even expired by the way.

A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2. Avoid getting chilled by standing or sitting for any length of time when the body is unduly heated, or by neglecting to change underclothing as soon as possible after profuse sweating.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1887#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The (Colony of the)', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'This position altogether is so far clear. But we have been subject to such misrepresentations when combating stereotyped misstatements as regards West Africa, that we will not allow any one to misunderstand us. The opinions we put forward with regard to the climate of West Africa have not been hastily or crudely formed, nor have they been adopted to serve some temporary or interested purpose. They are the result of evidence that cannot be disproved. They are promulgated by us to remove prejudices which war against our efforts for the advancement of civilization in Africa, and because we feel that they are pregnant with most practical results. We do not, for instance, pretend that the West African climate is not unhealthy. We admit that it is. But we as fearlessly contend that it is not one whit more unhealthy for Europeans than many of the West India Islands, or than Hong Kong, China, or India, &c. These regions are equally liable to visitations of epidemic disease as is West Africa, in the shape of yellow fever, dysentery, &c. We are, moreover, firmly convinced that if ever the day arrives when complete, and not mere partial statistical tables, are compiled, showing the mortality amongst Europeans at the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and even the new settlement at Lagos, the facts fairly and impartially revealed will demonstrate that at least a moiety of the deaths which occur amongst them are not the result of climatic disease, but are chargeable occasionally to accident; more frequently to a lamentable and wanton neglect of ordinary care and precautions; and too often to reckless indulgences, which will in any climate sap the springs of life, and ultimately destroy it. As additional evidences in support of these statements, take, for example, the records with regard to the numerous governors who have served, or are now serving, in West Africa. We find that in most instances they were and are men who had passed middle life before being called upon to administer those Governments, and were consequently far less able to bear up against attacks of fever. Yet, of the thirty-four gentlemen who have governed Sierra Leone from 1792 to 1864, seven only died there in that long period of seventy-two years. Of those seven, one was killed in action, another veteran most unwisely made fruit and vegetables his sole diet; and one of them had previously lived upwards of thirty-five years in the colony, dying at sea, not of disease incident to the climate, but of cancer of the stomach.

Nor do you make any distinction between the colonies, classing Sierra Leone with Lagos, Gambia, and Cape Coast, which I am sure the facts would not warrant.\n\nTo revert, however, to the causes of mortality on the West Coast of Africa, I am of opinion that there are many influential causes conducing to the same which might be prevented, and I take the liberty of intruding on your valuable space to enumerate one or two of them.\n\n1. The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics.

In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction. More commonly, the competition for captive labour generated intense hostility among and within trading factions.

In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans.

From about 1890 concessionaires were given the whole produce of the land in vast areas of the Free State, while the system was supplemented by the creation of Leopold's Domaine PrivØ from 1892. Within a decade the system had spread to the other two areas and remained intact until almost the First World War. Indeed AndrØ Gide found substantial remnants in the late 1920s. 69 Great similarities existed in each of the systems. The Africans discovered that they no longer owned even their accumulated ivory and that they had to kill elephants for more ivory and scour the forest for rubber. Some of the most callous riffraff of Europe drifted in to become agents for the concessionaires, and to an extraordinary degree they were permitted to utilize the apparatus of the colonial administration including its army, police and courts. Taxation and compulsory labour, although in theory limited, were reinterpreted by the agents to mean such continuous work that crop planting and, consequently, diet suffered very considerably. The population grew reluctant to toil collecting, and to hand over what had always been communally theirs. Imprisonment was an unsatisfactory punishment as it reduced the available labour. Instead, floggings, mutila› tion, the taking as hostages of women and children, the burning of villages and a considerable amount of killing were employed. Undoubtedly disease and famine followed the break-up of the village organization of labour and the flight of whole villages.$^{70}$ No one kept adequate population records See J.

Forced labour was increased after 1927 by the installation of the administrative services at Niamey and by the extension of the railway. This completely disrupted the farm calendar though the precariousness of the rains made farming times particularly important. The supplies of millet, noncompulsory, depended entirely on the local chiefs. In 1931, the refusal of the administration to lower the head tax, and its insistence on collective payment, which forced the peasants to pay also for deserters and for deceased people, led to a situation in which, as one report put it, 'entire villages vanished ... and an age group was completely decimated'$^{47}$ with, in some areas, a mortality rate of over 50%."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm, Ascaris infections, schistosomiasis, filariasis and Guinea worm. To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease. Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively. Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s. Nevertheless, tropical medical schools were established in Europe as early as 1897 in Liverpool and London, 1900 in Hamburg, 1901 in Brussels, followed later by Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles, and in Africa by 1912 in Cape Town and 1918 in Dakar."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""However, the development which probably had the earliest impact on the mortality level was the penetration of the roads and railways. By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

Forced recruitment of porters in all districts in Northern Rhodesia meant that for a large part of the war over a third of the adult males of the territory were involved in carrier service.$^{28}$ After 1917, the heavy demands of the Syrian front forced the British Protectorate government in Egypt to introduce conscrip› tion and requisition of animals despite its earlier promise that it would bear the full burden of the war.

It is generally considered that communities that gradually take up agriculture and animal husbandry continue for a long time to show a low annual growth rate (between 0.05 and 0.10 per cent), which is fairly close to the known growth rate of hunting and food-gathering communities. On the other hand, communities with a more diversified agriculture have a much higher annual growth rate, put between 0.10 and 0.15 per cent. Figures for a difficult natural environment like that of Africa are unknown: but they are no doubt not very far from this model. Spread over more than two centuries, an increase of this order in the growth rate would have had a considerable effect on the overall population of Central Africa. 6\nCompared with twentieth-century growth rates these figures admittedly seem low. The fact is that in early African communities the death rate remained high. For the nineteenth century the main causes of death are known, but it is impossible to determine the extent of each one's con› tribution to the total.\nFirst, there were historical factors, especially the slave trade and its attendant violence. While the manpower drain of the slave trade to America was sharply reduced as from the 1850s, the Swahili and Arab trade took over to the east and north of our area. Figures can be given of overall losses for the whole of Central Africa,$^{7}$ but it is unlikely that it will ever be possible to give a geographical breakdown, especially as the continual movement of groups and individuals spread the impact of the slave trade far and wide.\nThere were also ecological and epidemiological factors. The nineteenth century certainly saw the beginnings of medical progress in Central Africa, such as better knowledge of endemic diseases, use of vaccination and more general use of quinine. But this progress remained confined to the circles visited by traders from Angola or the Swahili coast.

The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy.

Local industry stood up well to competition, and a balanced budget continued to be ensured thanks to esparto exports. 89 But the continual food shortage from 1881 to 1889 was the first sign of far-reaching change. Exports suffered. In addition, the market price of esparto collapsed, the volume of imported foodstuffs increased and from 1892 onwards the balance of trade showed a deficit. This deficit assumed huge proportions and became permanent after 1897. For, from that time onwards, the food requirements of the masses changed. Imported tea, sugar, flour and tobacco were widely consumed in large quantities. Then the income from Saharan trade dried up.

It might be urged that Cape Coast is equally as bad, but this statement can only be regarded as devoid of all foundation, as out of 800 men stationed there, there were on the 19th inst. only eighty-six in the hospital (little more than ten per cent.), but at Prahsoo there are fifty per cent., not reckoning men who are convalescent and unfit for duty. The men in hospital are principally suffering from acute dysentery, diarrhoea, rheumatism, and fever. The worst types of these diseases present themselves, as the men\'s constitutions are so utterly degenerated by bad nourishment, that a vast amount of medical comfort is demanded to keep them alive; besides, to keep the men here there must be a store full of quinine, for whilst I had it I was compelled to use over 600 grains a-day, and such a supply cannot be kept up.\n\n""The whole of the officers, with the exception of one, within this short period have suffered greatly; five have been prostrated with fever, one has been invalided to the Coast. You have suffered from hepatic derangement, and now are suffering from diarrhoea. With respect to myself, I am feeling the six months of bush-life telling on my constitution, and my remaining up here is just a matter of a short time; I have suffered constantly from fever, and now I am suffering from a slight attack of acute dysentery, a disease for which I have been invalided from the Coast before. I shall endeavour to do my duty heartily as long as I can do it without danger to my life, but no sooner do I feel worse than I shall at once, without the least hesitation, proceed to the Coast for medical treatment.\n\n""May I, therefore, beg of you to bring the circumstances of the case before the officer commanding, and endeavour to impress upon him the advisability of withdrawing the troops, if not on'}, {'id': 394, 'article_title': 'ASHANTEE WAR', 'full_section_title': 'ASHANTEE WAR', 'last_edit_date': '06-01-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1864#article-5', 'issue_date': '23_07_1864', 'content': 'Sanitary grounds, for the sake of humanity, until there is an improvement in the weather; for I am certain that it need only be properly brought before the colonel commanding, as he will not allow the whole of his force to be crippled before actual operations are undertaken in the field in October next.\n\n""If the men are not removed there will be an awful mortality, and I consider myself perfectly free from all responsibility.—I have the honour to be, &c., &c.""\n\nIt appears that most of the deaths have been caused by dysentery, a disease of well-known fatality, especially when it takes the scorbutic form.

The head-quarters of the 2nd West India Regiment were only disembarked at Cape Coast on July 11 last; but although from the nature of their constant duties in the tropics, they might have been expected to be somewhat acclimatized; they speedily began to suffer from the prevailing forms of fever and dysentery. Many of the officers were attacked; the colonel of the regiment has come home in the Himalaya invalided, and the adjutant died a few days before the news left.\n\nA correspondent writes to the *Pall Mall Gazette*: ""The invalids from the West Coast of Africa state that dysentery and fever were engendered by the supply of bad water and defective salt provisions. They assert, and they have not been contradicted, that the pork stored at Cape Coast Castle for the use of the garrison and troops, is inferior in quality, and therefore not fit to be served out. The fever which has proved so fatal to the Royal Artillery is one of a bilious type.""\n\n**Hints for the Ashanti Expedition.**—We would advise officers and others to provide themselves with as few things as practicable by way of outfit for the field; to wear flannel or serge; have good boots and a light, easy head-dress; to avoid spirits, as a rule; to use condensed or boiled water whenever practicable, and to use filtered water when not—a pocket filter being provided for that purpose; to take a certain quantity of quinine as a daily article of diet, and not as a medicine, and always to begin the day with a good breakfast, and end it by taking care to guard against malaria by some covering above and waterproof sheet below, lighting a fire whenever practicable. It might be worth while for officers to provide themselves with a small respirator, to be worn when exposed to the night air. These are now being procured of very small size, and capable of being worn inside the lips, so as to be invisible.

It was a most distressing sight to witness the arrival of these poor creatures; and it is necessary to make a few preliminary remarks in order clearly to understand the difficulties with which the medical officers had to contend. The appearance of the slaves when landed was most striking. In some the expression of the countenance indicated sufferings, moral and physical, of the most profound and agonising nature. Others of them gazed vacantly around them in the most utter helplessness. Occasionally, among the newly-arrived groups all sense of suffering was merged in melancholic or raving madness. The wizened, shrunk, and skinny features were lighted up by the hollow, feverish eye. The belly was, as it were, tacked to the back, whilst the hip-bones protruded, and, in some cases, became the seat of foul, sloughing ulcers. The hand and skinny fingers seemed much elongated by the great and neglected growth of the nails, and they were so deplorably emaciated, that the skin appeared tensely stretched over, and tied down to the skeleton. The legs refused to perform their functions, and they reeled and tottered about from sheer debility. Their squalor and extreme wretchedness was heightened, in many cases, by the particoloured evacuations with which their bodies were besmeared. When large numbers of the sick were suffering from dysentery, the condition of the wards and yards in the morning was extremely loathsome. This was in a great degree unavoidable, as the sick were too weak to crawl from their mats to the commode, although everything was done under the surgeons\' orders to keep the wards as clean and wholesome as the crowded state of the hospital would admit of."" In a word, ""the moral and physical causes of depression were often so overwhelming, and so intensely concentrated, that the combination produced disease in such formidable shapes as to be beyond remedy. The mortality was consequently very great; many persons brought to the hospital in the last stage of disease died a few hours after their arrival; others even expired by the way. A large proportion died within a few days; and as the names of all these persons were recorded in the hospital books, the percentage of deaths was thereby largely increased.""\n\n*(To be continued.)*', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—I read the paragraph in your paper of this month under the above title, and can add my testimony to the value of “Lamplough’s Pyretic Saline,” if not as a sure preventive, certainly as a deterrent and palliative in African fevers.\n\nIn your remarks, however, I find no mention made of the probable causes of such mortality, which I think is necessary when speaking of the effects of a climate like West Africa, the bad reputation of which is so very much exaggerated. Nor do you make any distinction between the colonies, classing Sierra Leone with Lagos, Gambia, and Cape Coast, which I am sure the facts would not warrant.\n\nTo revert, however, to the causes of mortality on the West Coast of Africa, I am of opinion that there are many influential causes conducing to the same which might be prevented, and I take the liberty of intruding on your valuable space to enumerate one or two of them.\n\n1. The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics. In Brazil, no doubt, some Europeans drink themselves to death, but they are few; the majority, being of a better class, prefer to live well and to enjoy themselves rationally, without making beasts of themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sickness and Death among the Gold Coast Troops', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""are said not to be made with rosewater, campaigns in unhealthy tropical climates can never be as harmless as picnic parties. And when and how did these officers (and men) contract their fatal diseases? If their disease had been owing to immediate Government neglect, they would have been victims soon after their arrival. But no; the health of the forces was good from August, 1863, until some three weeks after they had marched in several directions into the bush of the interior. The mortality and sickness has occurred only since the end of February, with few exceptions. The local error committed we deem to have been this: The rains commenced two months before their time. We think that on the very first day of rain, all idea of further duty in the field should have been abandoned, and nearly all the troops have been ordered back to Cape Coast Castle without delay. When once the rains began, no troops could go into Ashantee, and no Ashantees would come into the Territories. Again, the campaign being over, we think the Tamar's men, who would otherwise have been marched up to camp immediately, where there were rations, &c., for fifty or sixty days, ought not to have been landed, there being no adequate accommodation for them. But the great sickness and death was not among these men, but among those who had been at Prahsoo and other up-country stations.\n\nWe hope that now the party battle has been fought, men will reason calmly about events which, though deplorable, have not the gravity that has been attributed to them. We never hear it said, when some regiment in India has been sent on necessary service, and the cholera has decimated it, that Government or the authorities deserve impeachment for sending men on such an expedition. And why should the case be different in Africa? We know, by news from the camp itself, that all necessary medicines and medical comforts were there. But the exhalations of a lately uncovered soil were poisonous; as also the water, which no attempt seems to have been made to purify, though sand was abundant, and charcoal enough might have been burned in a few days to form a filter bed for an army, instead of for a mere battalion. It must be acknowledged that the absence of inventive resources to meet emergencies in campaign, which peculiarly characterises our troops, greatly increases the difficulties of Government, and leads frequently to disease and death that might have been very easily averted."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1864#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE CLIMATE OF THE GOLD COAST', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following is taken from an article from the pen of Dr. J. A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2. Avoid getting chilled by standing or sitting for any length of time when the body is unduly heated, or by neglecting to change underclothing as soon as possible after profuse sweating.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1887#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of West Africa—Gold Mining—The Labour Question', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It is a remarkable fact that the Spaniards, Portuguese, and Frenchmen who live on the Coast, and who, as a general rule, live far less liberally than do the residents who are natives of the United Kingdom or America, show a much larger sick list and a much higher death rate than the men of the Anglo-Saxon race. It is generally agreed that this is to be attributed to our superior mode of living, for the Spaniards, Portuguese, and Frenchmen are generally as hardy and as strong as we are.\n\nThe Chairman advised Europeans to adopt a diet of ""rice, weak tea, and mild tobacco."" Well, any white man who went in for such a diet should be either made of cast iron—if such a being could be manufactured—or else must be an idiotic candidate for a suicide\'s grave. Why, Kroomen cannot exist continually on rice; their diet has to be changed, in their own country, to corn, and, in factories down the Coast, to biscuit, with a free allowance of beef. A twelvemonth\'s diet of rice produces in most Kroomen valvular disease of the heart, with dropsy of the extremities and abdomen, and if the case is not treated at once, on the first signs of swelling in the feet, by change of diet, with medicine, death follows in a few days. Perhaps the Chairman can stand a diet that will kill a Krooman?\n\nWith regard to longevity of life in Africa, and the time a man can stay out without change of climate, much depends on where he resides. In Gambia, men have resided seven years at a time without leaving the place. On the Southwest Coast, men like Mr. Walker have resided three or more years without going to Europe or Madeira; while in the Bights three years is a long spell—eighteen months to two years being about the average time. Then a man, if he is even not very ill, feels the climate has so tried him that a few months\' change to the north is absolutely necessary. The same rule applies to the Gold, Ivory, and Grain Coasts. But it is more than likely that on elevated ground, say fifty miles up the country, on these coasts, like the station of the Swiss Mission, near Ackra, that men could reside in very decent health for much longer periods, provided they have good food—fresh food, not tinned.\n\nHalf the mortality in the towns of the Gold Coast is caused by want of proper sanitation. Where every native yard is a private cemetery, where in such yards cesspools, years old, are the rule, and the ground is saturated with sewage, where water has to be stored in tanks, and is bad—how can the towns be healthy, under a tropical sun? With any quantity of land in the neigh\n\nhood of such towns, there is no public cemetery for the natives. With the towns elevated above the sea, and washed by the surf of the Atlantic, there is no attempt at proper drainage, and the removal of sewage to the sea. The native prejudice as regards interments and dirt, must be respected, or the boasted liberty of the British subject would be infringed; and then a proper system of burial and drainage would cost money!', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.625, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Alleged Death by Treadmill and Shot-drill', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I think the prison diet as described by Mr. Campbell is insufficient. I think also that a man who has been sixteen hours and a half without food is not fit to be put on shot-drill. A man in such a state would become more exhausted, and the exercise would tell more generally upon him. It is dangerous practice for the men to sit down in the open yard, coming hot from drill, without covering or shelter. In January the temperature has been recorded as low as 54 deg., and as high as 90 deg. The average of variation from six A.M. to noon is 25 deg. to 30 deg. I think the prison clothing is insufficient for the morning temperature. I think the temperature varies more here than in Europe, and therefore greater caution is necessary, especially when a man is not sufficiently fed. I think that blankets are essential at night, and sleeping without them improper. Shot-drill was originally a military punishment, and is still used. If a man has any disease which would cause obstruction in the chest or tendency to rupture, shot-drill would be forbidden him. A man sentenced to shot-drill is always examined by the surgeon before the sentence is carried out. I think that a medical man who has attended the patient in life can much more correctly judge the cause of death than one called only to make a post mortem examination.\n\nAs I did not see Gordon, therefore I would not undertake to say that the shot-drill, along with the insufficient clothing and food, might not have been the exciting cause of his disease. I believe it was excited by cold. In my examination of the body I judge that Gordon was a healthy man. There was no appearance of any disease that could cause death, except the inflammation of the lungs. If there was any cause of obstruction in the lungs, excessive labour would cause engorgement. The enlargement of the spleen and liver observed were probably the result of former disease, but would not cause any tendency to obstruction in the lungs. ""I should consider it a most dangerous practice to set convicts to hard labour without previous medical examination to ascertain their fitness; lives might often be sacrificed that way."" I think that it would be a dangerous thing to take off the shirt and throw cold water on the body—that is, when exhausted. If not exhausted there would be no danger, for then there is abundant power of generating heat.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Critical Condition of the Congo Free State', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Of course there are some noble exceptions, but it is only the few who have an interest in the country and in the well-being of the people.

With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies.

A severe attack of dysentery followed, and when convalescent, though still weak, he was sent to the coast on his way home, with the most solemn warnings not to touch strong drinks. Yet, while waiting for the steamer, he sold his coat for a bottle of gin, and twelve hours later he was in his grave. Another engineer somehow obtained possession of a bottle of brandy at lunch, and was shortly afterwards found dead with the bottle under his head. ""Strong drink on the Congo,"" added Mr. Stanley, ""means death.""\n\nLeaving this melancholy phase of the subject, I asked, ""What do you expect will be the immediate effect of the Congo Railway?""\n\n""It will alter the entire aspect of everything,"" answered Mr. Stanley. ""It will give new life to the State, and introduce civilization into the heart of Africa very rapidly indeed. At present there are some thousands of native traders at Stanley Pool, and there are European traders at the head of the navigation of the Lower Congo, so close to the cataracts that they can hear their roar; yet the two cannot come together on account of these cataracts, which form a gap 235 miles long. This gap can only be bridged by the native carriers, who are all absorbed in the transport of some 1,200 tons of merchandise in the year. While this state of things lasts progress is impossible. These 1,200 tons now being transported on the heads and backs of the carriers would be a mere drop in the ocean, compared with the goodly trade that would be going up the Congo if the native traders could be supplied with a sufficient quantity of goods.""\n\n""This, then, is probably one reason of the excessive dearness of ivory, which threatens soon to become worth nearly its weight in gold?""\n\n""It is the only reason. Ivory has almost disappeared from all the accessible areas of Africa; but the areas at present inaccessible are so vast that there is abundance of ivory, and also of rubber. The native traders are willing and eager to search for these precious articles; but if they all rushed up the affluents of the Congo to fetch goods, they might be years in getting rid of them. Thus you may see how great an impetus commerce will receive from the construction of the railway. As soon as the natives have gathered all the ivory from their own resorts, they will be urged by the demand for more to proceed still further into the interior, taking with them the worth of their goods in the produce of English industry.""\n\n""Then you think, Mr. Stanley, that one of the earliest results to be expected from the railway would be the cheapening of ivory?""', 'last_edit_date': '1886-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1886#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.623, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'RAPID ILLNESS AND DEATH OF AN AFRICAN IN LIVERPOOL.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A Mr. Edward Johnson, of Sierra Leone, landed at Liverpool from the steamship Congo, on the 3rd August.

Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction. More commonly, the competition for captive labour generated intense hostility among and within trading factions.

As a result the Allied powers had to divert scarce military resources, needed for fighting the Germans in Africa as well as on the Western Front, to dealing with local revolts. So scarce were these resources, and so widespread the revolts in certain areas such as French West Africa and Libya that the reimposition of European control over the revolted areas had to be delayed until troops became available. Large areas of Haut-SØnØgal-Niger and Dahomey remained out of French control for as long as a year for lack of troops. Thus the French were initially unable to deal with the revolt of 1916 in Dahomeyan Borgu because neighbouring groups - the Somba of Atacora, the Pila Pila of Semere and the Ohori among others - were also in revolt. In Morocco Lyautey, its conquistador, feared that metropolitan instructions to return half his 70000 troops to France and withdraw to the Atlantic coast might lead to revolt. Though he had to release the men, he did not withdraw and managed to avert challenge to his authority. As it was, France had to keep the other 35 000 troops in Morocco throughout the war. In Portuguese East Africa the German invasion inspired Portuguese subjects to take the occasion to overthrow their hated overlords. 31 The causes of the widespread revolts and protest movements that took place during the war varied considerably and were not all directly connected with the war itself. In some cases what were described as revolts were, in effect, as in Libya, just the continuation of primary resistance to European occupation. In many cases the motives for revolt or protest were mixed. There can be no doubt that the visual evidence of the apparent weakening of European authority as represented by the exodus of Euro› peans encouraged those contemplating revolt just as the influx of Europeans, in particular British troops, discouraged it in Egypt.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The First World War and its consequences', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""CROWDER The First World War was essentially a quarrel between European powers which involved Africa, both directly and indirectly, because at the outbreak of hostilities the greater part of it was ruled by the European belligerents. Campaigns were fought on African soil which - though they only marginally affected the overall course of war - had significant implications for Africa. More than a million African soldiers were involved in these campaigns or campaigns in Europe. Even more men, as well as women and children, were recruited, often forcibly, as carriers to support armies whose supplies could not be moved by conventional methods such as road, rail or packanimal. Over 150000 soldiers and carriers lost their lives during the war. Many more were wounded and disabled. By the time the war ended, every country in Africa, with the exception of the small Spanish territories which remained neutral - had been formally committed to one side or the other. Belgian, British, French, Italian and Portuguese administrations were allied - more or less actively - against German colonies (see Fig. 2.1). Even the last remaining independent states on the continent - Liberia, Ethiopia and Därfür - became involved. Liberia declared for the Allies on the entry of the United States into the war in 1917. The pro-Muslim boy-Emperor of Ethiopia, Lij Iyasu, proclaimed his country's allegiance to Turkey, thereby causing considerable concern among the Allies that he would inspire a djihäd among the Muslims of the Horn of Africa where Sayyid Muhammad Abdule Hasan's forces were still giving trouble to the British. British, French and Italian troops moved to Berbera, Djibuti and Massawa, but the intervention proved unnecessary since shocked Christian nobles overthrew the Emperor in September 1916. Similarly, Sultan 'All Dinar of Därfür, nominally tributary to, but effectively independent of, the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, responded to the Turkish call to djihäd and raided French Chad, threatened British Borno (Northern Nigeria) and tried to stir up revolt in Kordof an (Sudan).

E. Betts' contribution (Chapter 13), a full-time or standing army. As has been amply demonstrated, most traditional African states south of the Sahara did not have standing armies. In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W. Gutteridge has admitted, the armed forces have 'operated in the longer term against the stability of the ex-colonies'.

Thus, under the colonial system, Africans were in most cases made to produce what they did not consume and to consume what they did not produce, clear evidence of the lopsided and exploitive nature of the colonial economy. In those parts of Africa where Africans were not allowed to grow cash crops such as Kenya and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), as Colin Leys has shown, 'within the space of a generation they had effectively been converted from independent peasants, producing cash crops for the new markets, into peasants dependent on agricultural wage-labour'. 27 Sixthly, the commercialization of land already referred to led to the illegal sale of communal lands by unscrupulous family-heads and to increasing litigation over land which caused widespread poverty especially among the ruling houses. In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The First World War and its consequences', 'section_title': 'The European exodus', 'content': ""The war saw a large-scale exodus of European administrative and com› mercial personnel from the Allied colonies in Africa, as they left for the Western Front or enlisted in locally based regiments for campaigns else› where in Africa.

In fact, African reactions were the very reverse. It is quite evident that Africans were faced with only two options, either to readily surrender their sovereignty and independence, or to defend them at all costs. It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.\nJohn D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty. To them, there could be no compromise on that, and indeed many of the leaders of these states chose to die on the battlefield, go into voluntary flight or face exile rather than surrender their sovereignty without a struggle.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy of the former French, Belgian and Portuguese zones, 1914-35', 'section_title': ""The workers' burden > The crises and their repercussions"", 'content': 'The situation of the Africans, always precarious, became in 1930 as tragic as it had been at the beginning of the period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'Much the same doubts could be cast on another of the trade goods, guns.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade.

Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927.

Of all Colonel Wood\'s regiment, which is composed of four companies, our company, the Bonny Contingent, was the only one that shared in the second battle, and had the honour of marching into Kumasi. We marched into the capital the same day the battle of Karsi was fought and won—viz., the 4th inst.—and arrived there at 7.30 p.m. We began the return march about 11 o\'clock next morning, the 5th, and since then we have marched fifty miles, and, as I am informed, shall garrison Monsi Hills till the white troops reach here. I cannot write you a longer letter now, but will write a long report or journal when I have a little more time. We have heard nothing of Captain Glover\'s force. I am very, very weak to-day, having to march fifteen miles from Amankuassi to the Monsi Hills, though I am suffering from an attack of lumbago. The 42nd, 23rd, Naval Brigade, Colonel Wood\'s Regiment, and Major Russell\'s, took part in the first battle, but, to speak candidly, the 42nd won both battles of Iginasu and Karsi. We share a great deal in the glory of the 42nd, for which I hope yourself and the chiefs will be pleased. There were very many of the 42nd wounded. I am informed there are about 200 sick and wounded.\n\n""In closing, I cannot but return my heartfelt thanks to God for my safety, and that of Mr. Jumbo. Martyn is here.

They appear to have suffered severely from the malarious climate of Cape Coast, the small contingent of Marine Artillery and Light Infantry sent from England at the outbreak of the war contributing no less than three officers and eighty-five non-commissioned officers and men to the numbers just arrived. The head-quarters of the 2nd West India Regiment were only disembarked at Cape Coast on July 11 last; but although from the nature of their constant duties in the tropics, they might have been expected to be somewhat acclimatized; they speedily began to suffer from the prevailing forms of fever and dysentery. Many of the officers were attacked; the colonel of the regiment has come home in the Himalaya invalided, and the adjutant died a few days before the news left.\n\nA correspondent writes to the *Pall Mall Gazette*: ""The invalids from the West Coast of Africa state that dysentery and fever were engendered by the supply of bad water and defective salt provisions. They assert, and they have not been contradicted, that the pork stored at Cape Coast Castle for the use of the garrison and troops, is inferior in quality, and therefore not fit to be served out. The fever which has proved so fatal to the Royal Artillery is one of a bilious type.""\n\n**Hints for the Ashanti Expedition.**—We would advise officers and others to provide themselves with as few things as practicable by way of outfit for the field; to wear flannel or serge; have good boots and a light, easy head-dress; to avoid spirits, as a rule; to use condensed or boiled water whenever practicable, and to use filtered water when not—a pocket filter being provided for that purpose; to take a certain quantity of quinine as a daily article of diet, and not as a medicine, and always to begin the day with a good breakfast, and end it by taking care to guard against malaria by some covering above and waterproof sheet below, lighting a fire whenever practicable. It might be worth while for officers to provide themselves with a small respirator, to be worn when exposed to the night air. These are now being procured of very small size, and capable of being worn inside the lips, so as to be invisible.

But no; the health of the forces was good from August, 1863, until some three weeks after they had marched in several directions into the bush of the interior. The mortality and sickness has occurred only since the end of February, with few exceptions. The local error committed we deem to have been this: The rains commenced two months before their time. We think that on the very first day of rain, all idea of further duty in the field should have been abandoned, and nearly all the troops have been ordered back to Cape Coast Castle without delay. When once the rains began, no troops could go into Ashantee, and no Ashantees would come into the Territories. Again, the campaign being over, we think the Tamar's men, who would otherwise have been marched up to camp immediately, where there were rations, &c., for fifty or sixty days, ought not to have been landed, there being no adequate accommodation for them. But the great sickness and death was not among these men, but among those who had been at Prahsoo and other up-country stations.\n\nWe hope that now the party battle has been fought, men will reason calmly about events which, though deplorable, have not the gravity that has been attributed to them. We never hear it said, when some regiment in India has been sent on necessary service, and the cholera has decimated it, that Government or the authorities deserve impeachment for sending men on such an expedition. And why should the case be different in Africa? We know, by news from the camp itself, that all necessary medicines and medical comforts were there. But the exhalations of a lately uncovered soil were poisonous; as also the water, which no attempt seems to have been made to purify, though sand was abundant, and charcoal enough might have been burned in a few days to form a filter bed for an army, instead of for a mere battalion. It must be acknowledged that the absence of inventive resources to meet emergencies in campaign, which peculiarly characterises our troops, greatly increases the difficulties of Government, and leads frequently to disease and death that might have been very easily averted."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1864#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sanitariums for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'M\'Carthy\'s Island, River Gambia, Dec. 20, 1864.\n\nMy Lord,—In the editorial article in the Lancet of October 13, page 442, we find the remark that ""it is a singular fact in medical geography that from St. Louis, Senegal, on the north, to Mossamedes, on the south, there is not upon the seaboard a single healthy acre of ground. The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.74, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Health Question in the Ashanti Expedition', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Lives are exposed, by command, to certain dangers—and such are the lives of those men who have been sent on duty by Her Majesty's Government to the Gold Coast—a heavy culpability attaches, unless every known reasonable precaution shall have been taken on their behalf.

What I have known to prove effectual is that, immediately on embarkation for Africa, and thenceforward throughout the voyage, Lamplough's Pyretic Saline and Quinine should be daily administered. The use of the said medicines should be continued in Africa every second or third day, and more frequently and liberally administered when indications of fever appear.\n\nI believe that if this system be adopted, the attacks of fever will be very slight.\n\nLamplough's Pyretic Saline, as a remedy for African fever, was first brought under my notice in my capacity as Editor of the African Times, some ten or eleven years ago, by his Excellency Colonel Hill, then Governor at Sierra Leone, who told me he did not think so much of African fever as he did of English influenza; that he had been attacked nine times by African fever, but that the attacks were very slight and transient indeed; and that this was owing to his constant and free use of Lamplough's Pyretic Saline.\n\nIt may naturally suggest itself to you that the Army medical officers must thoroughly understand malarious fevers, and will doubtless adopt all necessary measures for the health and safety of the men.

This last gave as his opinion, ""that a few thousands spent at Cameroons or Fernando Po would, calculating only the market value of seamen\'s lives, repay themselves in as many years."" But the pros and cons of that lofty range as a sanitarium must be considered, and officers on the Coast should be consulted before the Home Government attempt to spend a large amount on it. There are many advantages in its favour, as may be seen described in the work of Captain Burton, on ""Abeokuta and the Cameroons,"" but there are also some great disadvantages attaching to it as a military sanitarium.\n\nIts distance from the different military stations on the Coast is one great objection, as it is situated about 400 miles below the last—viz., Lagos. It will be no great consolation for a sick officer—laid up, perhaps, with intractable fever, debility, diarrhœa, or dysentery, to be ordered, say, from the Gambia or Sierra Leone, to the Cameroons Mountains, a distance of about 2,000 miles, in a steam-packet, which is most uncomfortable, and unadapted for the conveyance of the sick during a voyage of eighteen days, in a direction quite opposite to the accustomed route—viz., to Teneriffe, Madeira, or England. The result would be found invariably to be that most of the cases, and certainly all the serious dysenteric cases, would succumb before the patient could reach the mountain of good hope. As a naval sanitarium it would be excellent, as it is in the neighbourhood of the rendezvous of the West African squadron, extending from the Volta to the Island of Ascension; and of the great oil rivers, to which so many English merchant vessels resort. Those on the Sierra Leone station should, however, have the advantage of the sanitarium about to be proposed.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'So much has been said and written about the climate of West Africa, and it has been so long the fashion to abuse and condemn it without inquiry, that the medical profession, like the general public, have accepted and endorsed the common report as an established fact. It is therefore important to find such mischievous exaggerations combated by a medical officer, who writes of West Africa, not from hearsay evidence, but from the experience derived during a residence of twenty-three years in the colony of Sierra Leone and settlements of the Gold Coast. We make these remarks by way of introducing to more general notice the papers above noted, because they supply much valuable and novel information, not only regarding the diseases to which Europeans and natives are subject in West Africa, but because they furnish an interesting description of the topography of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.\n\nMr. Clarke is of opinion that the climate of West Africa, if fairly tested, can stand comparison in point of healthfulness with most of our colonies in the East or West Indies, where endemic and epidemic fevers, dysentery, with cholera to boot, prevail quite as frequently and fatally. There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years. Comparatively, their number is not small, comprehending persons of all classes—governors, civil and military officers, merchants, and missionaries, with their wives and families. He states ""that formerly many officers in the English, Dutch, and Danish service resided upon the Gold Coast, some fourteen, twenty, and thirty years,* and enjoyed good health, although those in subordinate positions had to remove from one station to another."" The fact ought no longer to be concealed, that half at least of the deaths and incapacities which occur amongst Europeans arise from errors of personal economy, and that the mortality lists are unfairly swelled by ascribing to the climate deaths which have been caused by accident or intemperance.\n\nThe following passages may be adduced as proof that the climate is not to blame for everything:—', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.717, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The frightful condition in which the slaves are landed from the captured slavers at Sierra Leone is vividly depicted:—\n\n""At the period I took charge of the Kissy Hospitals (1837) the slave-trade was in active operation, consequently great numbers of liberated Africans were constantly received into hospital. It was a most distressing sight to witness the arrival of these poor creatures; and it is necessary to make a few preliminary remarks in order clearly to understand the difficulties with which the medical officers had to contend. The appearance of the slaves when landed was most striking. In some the expression of the countenance indicated sufferings, moral and physical, of the most profound and agonising nature. Others of them gazed vacantly around them in the most utter helplessness. Occasionally, among the newly-arrived groups all sense of suffering was merged in melancholic or raving madness. The wizened, shrunk, and skinny features were lighted up by the hollow, feverish eye. The belly was, as it were, tacked to the back, whilst the hip-bones protruded, and, in some cases, became the seat of foul, sloughing ulcers. The hand and skinny fingers seemed much elongated by the great and neglected growth of the nails, and they were so deplorably emaciated, that the skin appeared tensely stretched over, and tied down to the skeleton. The legs refused to perform their functions, and they reeled and tottered about from sheer debility. Their squalor and extreme wretchedness was heightened, in many cases, by the particoloured evacuations with which their bodies were besmeared. When large numbers of the sick were suffering from dysentery, the condition of the wards and yards in the morning was extremely loathsome. This was in a great degree unavoidable, as the sick were too weak to crawl from their mats to the commode, although everything was done under the surgeons\' orders to keep the wards as clean and wholesome as the crowded state of the hospital would admit of."" In a word, ""the moral and physical causes of depression were often so overwhelming, and so intensely concentrated, that the combination produced disease in such formidable shapes as to be beyond remedy. The mortality was consequently very great; many persons brought to the hospital in the last stage of disease died a few hours after their arrival; others even expired by the way. A large proportion died within a few days; and as the names of all these persons were recorded in the hospital books, the percentage of deaths was thereby largely increased.""\n\n*(To be continued.)*', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'West Coast Climate—Yellow Fever—Army and Navy Mismanagement', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'So furious has been the attempt to ""taboo"" or ""put down"" the West Coast of Africa because of its climate, that we have no option but to return to the subject.

Yes, here is new evidence of the fact, that the denunciations hurled by the families of victims, and by journalists ignorant in these matters, upon the climate of certain portions of the globe under British rule or power, in which British soldiers, sailors, and civilians have to serve, ought rather to be heaped on the authorities who so unnecessarily and wantonly sacrifice the lives of their fellow-subjects and fellow-servants.

Nor do you make any distinction between the colonies, classing Sierra Leone with Lagos, Gambia, and Cape Coast, which I am sure the facts would not warrant.\n\nTo revert, however, to the causes of mortality on the West Coast of Africa, I am of opinion that there are many influential causes conducing to the same which might be prevented, and I take the liberty of intruding on your valuable space to enumerate one or two of them.\n\n1. The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics. In Brazil, no doubt, some Europeans drink themselves to death, but they are few; the majority, being of a better class, prefer to live well and to enjoy themselves rationally, without making beasts of themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Classified medical returns of the colonial hospitals, Sierra Leone, for thirteen years, are in the possession of the Statistical Society.

He says: ""They are generally runaway slaves, yet discipline and their elevation from serfs to freemen soon enable them to appreciate their improved position. When claimed by their owners (a circumstance which is constantly occurring), an arrangement is made to indemnify them, and redeem the slave by the payment of 8l. sterling, that sum being deducted by instalments from the man\'s pay. Their services during the Kroboe revolt, in 1858, and disturbance in the Abra district, in 1859, showed their value as soldiers."" It is, therefore, with no small regret that we have lately had occasion to refer to the mutinous conduct of these men; but judging from all we have heard of the cause of their insubordination, the conclusion has forced itself upon our minds that these outbreaks never would have occurred had their officers known how to govern them and obtain their respect; and should the cause of these mutinies ever be adequately inquired into, we have strong reason for believing it would then be found that, however guilty the men may have been, they have been sinned against as well as sinning.\n\nMr. Clarke thus describes the privileges enjoyed by the officers of the Gold Coast Artillery Corps; but before quoting further from his paper on this head, we may remark that he has overlooked one of their most valued privileges—viz., that they undergo no preliminary examination prior to being appointed.

With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CLIMATE OF WESTERN AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I am not singular in believing that healthy Europeans coming to Africa to reside may do so with comparative safety, if they will only take proper precautions to preserve their health.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.61, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': 'until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""However, the development which probably had the earliest impact on the mortality level was the penetration of the roads and railways. By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either.

The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.612, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy of the former French, Belgian and Portuguese zones, 1914-35', 'section_title': ""The workers' burden > The crises and their repercussions > Food shortage, famine and epidemic"", 'content': ""There were situations of severe famine such as that in Niger in 1930, of which Zerma-Sonrai still have memories, followed by an invasion of locusts.

This completely disrupted the farm calendar though the precariousness of the rains made farming times particularly important. The supplies of millet, noncompulsory, depended entirely on the local chiefs. In 1931, the refusal of the administration to lower the head tax, and its insistence on collective payment, which forced the peasants to pay also for deserters and for deceased people, led to a situation in which, as one report put it, 'entire villages vanished ... and an age group was completely decimated'$^{47}$ with, in some areas, a mortality rate of over 50%."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.607, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns against epidemic disease apparently gained some success. The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered. Yellow fever epidemics have occurred from Senegal to Sudan at unpredictable intervals. By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

What was less frequently emphasized by the new regimes was the heavy loss of life arising in parts of Africa from their intervention. The deaths were rarely a product of the original extension of administration, but rather of the suppression of subsequent revolts and of the ensuing punitive expeditions which apparently often inflicted most damage because of starvation resulting from the upsetting of the subsistence farming cycle.

The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals.

On the other hand, communities with a more diversified agriculture have a much higher annual growth rate, put between 0.10 and 0.15 per cent.

With temperance in diet, stimulants, and, generally, personal cleanliness as well as surrounding cleanliness, a free interchange of air in dormitories, exercise in the open air, and a moderate exposure to the sun, I think Europeans, fully grown and with sound constitutions, could remain many years on the Coast, and return to Europe without much impairment of health. This would be very much more true could merchants choose their trading stations. For obvious reasons at present the mouths of the rivers are chosen, which above all are the most unhealthy places, especially as in many cases pure water cannot be had, and river water, often impure, is used for all purposes. Afloat, with little communication with the shore, no general leave at notoriously unhealthy places, using distilled water, or good spring water when it can be had without exposing the men to too much fatigue or malaria, avoiding river waters, and rarely entering them; a free use of quinine when required; doing away with boat cruising, more berthing accommodation, a liberal supply of fresh beef and vegetables, allowing the men to buy stock at the various places, less drill aloft, great attention to personal cleanliness and the general cleanliness of the ship, I feel sure, putting aside the so-called infectious epidemics, which ought rarely to occur, the health of the cruisers would be as good as on any station, and better than on many.""'}]","[{'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""The sanitary condition of the town of Cape Coast, and indeed of all the towns upon the seaboard, is deplorable.

We are, moreover, firmly convinced that if ever the day arrives when complete, and not mere partial statistical tables, are compiled, showing the mortality amongst Europeans at the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and even the new settlement at Lagos, the facts fairly and impartially revealed will demonstrate that at least a moiety of the deaths which occur amongst them are not the result of climatic disease, but are chargeable occasionally to accident; more frequently to a lamentable and wanton neglect of ordinary care and precautions; and too often to reckless indulgences, which will in any climate sap the springs of life, and ultimately destroy it. As additional evidences in support of these statements, take, for example, the records with regard to the numerous governors who have served, or are now serving, in West Africa. We find that in most instances they were and are men who had passed middle life before being called upon to administer those Governments, and were consequently far less able to bear up against attacks of fever. Yet, of the thirty-four gentlemen who have governed Sierra Leone from 1792 to 1864, seven only died there in that long period of seventy-two years. Of those seven, one was killed in action, another veteran most unwisely made fruit and vegetables his sole diet; and one of them had previously lived upwards of thirty-five years in the colony, dying at sea, not of disease incident to the climate, but of cancer of the stomach. At the Gambia, none of the governors have died since 1837, when\n[January 23, 1864.]', 'last_edit_date': '1864-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1864#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'West Coast Climate—Yellow Fever—Army and Navy Mismanagement', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'So furious has been the attempt to ""taboo"" or ""put down"" the West Coast of Africa because of its climate, that we have no option but to return to the subject.

Yes, here is new evidence of the fact, that the denunciations hurled by the families of victims, and by journalists ignorant in these matters, upon the climate of certain portions of the globe under British rule or power, in which British soldiers, sailors, and civilians have to serve, ought rather to be heaped on the authorities who so unnecessarily and wantonly sacrifice the lives of their fellow-subjects and fellow-servants.

The want of proper sanitary measures is another reason why the climate of West Africa proves fatal to many European constitutions. When streets and yards, both back and front of houses, are made the receptacles of filth and excrement, of putrified remains of dead dogs, cats, and other animal and vegetable matter, is it to be wondered at that the miasma rising from these dung-heaps eventually becomes fatal to those constantly inhaling it. This is a cause which it would be well for the colonial authorities here to take into their serious consideration, as it is most certainly a preventible one. It was only in 1871, during the administration of Mr. J. Pope Hennessy, that the sanitary condition of Freetown seriously occupied the attention of the Government; but whether that gentleman’s plans have ever been efficiently carried out, and what effects they have hitherto had there, we have no means here to ascertain.\n\n3. The Europeans on the West Coast of Africa, unlike their countrymen in India, South America, and elsewhere, perhaps for the reasons I have already stated, are so careless of their personal comfort, and so intent upon accumulating as much money as they can, that they deny themselves every convenience necessary in a tropical climate. In Sierra Leone, for instance, they live in the town, which is at the sea-shore, instead of on the mountains, where they would enjoy the sea breezes equally as well, and be in a cooler and healthier atmosphere. In support of this view, I will only quote a passage which occurs in a paper read by Mr. Hennessy before the Society of Arts in April, 1873, in which he says: “The mountain district (of Sierra Leone), according to the Registrar-General’s Returns, appears to be as healthy as any part of England, or indeed as Madeira, the climate of which it closely resembles.”\n\nI hope I have clearly shown that the large mortality on the West Coast of Africa is not entirely due to climatic influences, and that a great deal could be done by the Government and the Europeans to counteract and mitigate those influences. As living proofs of what I have stated, I beg to point out Mr. Magnus Smith, Mr. A. Montagu, Mr. Marston, and half-a-dozen others, who have resided in Sierra Leone for fifteen or twenty years without meeting with the same fate as their countrymen, and simply because they have known how to live.—I am, dear Sir,', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of West Africa—Gold Mining—The Labour Question', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It is a remarkable fact that the Spaniards, Portuguese, and Frenchmen who live on the Coast, and who, as a general rule, live far less liberally than do the residents who are natives of the United Kingdom or America, show a much larger sick list and a much higher death rate than the men of the Anglo-Saxon race. It is generally agreed that this is to be attributed to our superior mode of living, for the Spaniards, Portuguese, and Frenchmen are generally as hardy and as strong as we are.\n\nThe Chairman advised Europeans to adopt a diet of ""rice, weak tea, and mild tobacco."" Well, any white man who went in for such a diet should be either made of cast iron—if such a being could be manufactured—or else must be an idiotic candidate for a suicide\'s grave. Why, Kroomen cannot exist continually on rice; their diet has to be changed, in their own country, to corn, and, in factories down the Coast, to biscuit, with a free allowance of beef. A twelvemonth\'s diet of rice produces in most Kroomen valvular disease of the heart, with dropsy of the extremities and abdomen, and if the case is not treated at once, on the first signs of swelling in the feet, by change of diet, with medicine, death follows in a few days. Perhaps the Chairman can stand a diet that will kill a Krooman?\n\nWith regard to longevity of life in Africa, and the time a man can stay out without change of climate, much depends on where he resides. In Gambia, men have resided seven years at a time without leaving the place. On the Southwest Coast, men like Mr. Walker have resided three or more years without going to Europe or Madeira; while in the Bights three years is a long spell—eighteen months to two years being about the average time. Then a man, if he is even not very ill, feels the climate has so tried him that a few months\' change to the north is absolutely necessary. The same rule applies to the Gold, Ivory, and Grain Coasts. But it is more than likely that on elevated ground, say fifty miles up the country, on these coasts, like the station of the Swiss Mission, near Ackra, that men could reside in very decent health for much longer periods, provided they have good food—fresh food, not tinned.\n\nHalf the mortality in the towns of the Gold Coast is caused by want of proper sanitation. Where every native yard is a private cemetery, where in such yards cesspools, years old, are the rule, and the ground is saturated with sewage, where water has to be stored in tanks, and is bad—how can the towns be healthy, under a tropical sun? With any quantity of land in the neigh\n\nhood of such towns, there is no public cemetery for the natives. With the towns elevated above the sea, and washed by the surf of the Atlantic, there is no attempt at proper drainage, and the removal of sewage to the sea.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—I read the paragraph in your paper of this month under the above title, and can add my testimony to the value of “Lamplough’s Pyretic Saline,” if not as a sure preventive, certainly as a deterrent and palliative in African fevers.\n\nIn your remarks, however, I find no mention made of the probable causes of such mortality, which I think is necessary when speaking of the effects of a climate like West Africa, the bad reputation of which is so very much exaggerated. Nor do you make any distinction between the colonies, classing Sierra Leone with Lagos, Gambia, and Cape Coast, which I am sure the facts would not warrant.\n\nTo revert, however, to the causes of mortality on the West Coast of Africa, I am of opinion that there are many influential causes conducing to the same which might be prevented, and I take the liberty of intruding on your valuable space to enumerate one or two of them.\n\n1. The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics. In Brazil, no doubt, some Europeans drink themselves to death, but they are few; the majority, being of a better class, prefer to live well and to enjoy themselves rationally, without making beasts of themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'HEALTH ON THE WEST COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Recently, in the House of Commons, Mr. Price asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies whether he has any confirmation of the report that during the first seven months of 1896, out of about twenty English officials in the colony of Sierra Leone, there were three deaths and five cases in which the officials had to be invalided home; whether officials have to serve fifteen months at Sierra Leone before obtaining leave, whereas in the Gold Coast Colony they have only to serve twelve months; and whether, seeing that Europeans are particularly subject to illness during the later months of their stay on the coast, the Colonial Office can see its way to making the rules as to leave in Sierra Leone the same as in the Gold Coast Colony.\n\nThe Right Hon. J. Chamberlain, the Secretary for the Colonies, in reply, said: ""I regret to state during the months in question, which were exceptionally unhealthy, no less than five deaths occurred among the English civil officials, of whom there are about thirty, and three were invalided home, besides two (including the Governor) who were invalided to the Canary Islands.

With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE CLIMATE OF THE GOLD COAST', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following is taken from an article from the pen of Dr. J. A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2. Avoid getting chilled by standing or sitting for any length of time when the body is unduly heated, or by neglecting to change underclothing as soon as possible after profuse sweating.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1887#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Fatal Epidemic at Senegal', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'By letters from Bathurst we are informed that the epidemic at Senegal is very terrible, the latest advices from thence reporting over 600 deaths.', 'last_edit_date': '1879-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1879#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}]",True
1460,European explorers and officials in 19th-century West Africa faced significant health risks and challenges due to diseases like fever and bronchitis.,"The observations from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the significant health risks and challenges faced by European explorers and officials in 19th-century West Africa due to diseases. The textbook highlights the severe health challenges Europeans encountered, evidenced by the high death rates among British West African forces, which were nine times greater for Europeans than for African soldiers. This disparity underscores the Europeans' vulnerability to indigenous diseases, exacerbated by a lack of medical preparedness for tropical diseases in Europe, where life expectancy was less than 40 years at the start of the century. The slow medical revolution, with advancements in understanding diseases like malaria and yellow fever occurring only towards the century's end, further illustrates these challenges. The establishment of tropical medical schools in Europe and Africa in the late 19th and early 20th centuries underscores the need to address these health issues. However, the textbook does not specifically mention fever and bronchitis, focusing instead on malaria, yellow fever, and sleeping sickness. In contrast, The African Times articles provide substantial evidence of fever and bronchitis as significant health risks, citing various fevers and bronchitis as causes of illness and death among Europeans, such as the death of William Horatio Cole from bronchitis. The articles also discuss the malarious climate, poor sanitary conditions, and lack of proper health precautions, which exacerbated these risks, while also noting that lifestyle choices like excessive alcohol consumption and poor dietary habits contributed to health issues. This nuanced perspective from the articles complements the textbook's broader historical context, providing a comprehensive view of the health challenges Europeans faced in West Africa during this period.","The paragraphs from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook provide several details that support the claim that European explorers and officials in 19th-century West Africa faced significant health risks and challenges due to diseases.

To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease. Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively. Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s. Nevertheless, tropical medical schools were established in Europe as early as 1897 in Liverpool and London, 1900 in Hamburg, 1901 in Brussels, followed later by Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles, and in Africa by 1912 in Cape Town and 1918 in Dakar."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.786, 'probability_score': 0.056, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""In tropical Africa governmental medicine was long a military concern although small civilian hospitals began to appear in the 1890s. From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

Certainly the conditions of the work camps encouraged the spread of venereal disease and diarrhoea. The workers, carrying within themselves the great load of worms and agents of diseases commonly found in tropical Africa, worked more strenuously at times than they had learnt was possible for them, and came down with sickness.

It is generally considered that communities that gradually take up agriculture and animal husbandry continue for a long time to show a low annual growth rate (between 0.05 and 0.10 per cent), which is fairly close to the known growth rate of hunting and food-gathering communities. On the other hand, communities with a more diversified agriculture have a much higher annual growth rate, put between 0.10 and 0.15 per cent. Figures for a difficult natural environment like that of Africa are unknown: but they are no doubt not very far from this model. Spread over more than two centuries, an increase of this order in the growth rate would have had a considerable effect on the overall population of Central Africa. 6\nCompared with twentieth-century growth rates these figures admittedly seem low. The fact is that in early African communities the death rate remained high. For the nineteenth century the main causes of death are known, but it is impossible to determine the extent of each one's con› tribution to the total.\nFirst, there were historical factors, especially the slave trade and its attendant violence.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns against epidemic disease apparently gained some success. The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered. Yellow fever epidemics have occurred from Senegal to Sudan at unpredictable intervals. By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The years from the early 1880s to the mid-iojos mark the demographic divide in Africa. At the beginning of the period the continent's population was still sparse, at least by the standards of the Old World. More signifi› cantly it probably was not growing rapidly and evidenced a vulnerability to the kind of pressures, both internal and external, which were being increasingly applied. By about 1935, the population was undoubtedly grow› ing because of increasing control over mortality, and the basis was laid for a doubling over the next third of a century which almost certainly hastened and consolidated independence.\nMany indices can be used to illustrate the changes between the two dates, and some help to explain the demographic transition. In 1880 a European presence inland from the coast was largely restricted to Algeria, where a third of a million migrants, mainly from France, Spain, Italy and Malta, had consolidated the victory of the French army, and South Africa, where a similar number of Europeans, predominantly of Dutch and English extraction, now had a vanguard as far north as the Limpopo river. (See Fig. i.i.) Elsewhere Europeans were beginning to exert control over Egypt and Tunisia, ruled some coastal populations in Senegal and the Gold Coast (now Ghana) and held such enclaves as The Gambia, Sierra Leone, Lagos, Libreville and parts of Angola and Mozambique. By 1935 European administations controlled almost the entire continent (see Fig. 12.2). The half century saw European medical science progressing from an ignorance of the cause of most of Africa's major diseases to an ability to contain or cure most of them; indeed the period ends just as the sulpha drugs were ushering in an era of chemotherapy of great significance for the continent.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

Commerce was one, although whether such activities brought prosperity and the ability to buy food in times of need and perhaps some health care in the few places where it existed to a greater degree than it brought disease arising from increased contact with strangers is debatable. By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent. There were two reasons for the trade: firstly that alcohol could be produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits; secondly, in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, there were real problems about what goods would be accepted in return for the produce of Africa.$^{43}$ Mary Kingsley found the trade spirit pure and likely to do less harm than cannabis,$^{44}$ a view shared by a committee that investigated the liquor trade in içoç.$^{45}$ Spirits were distributed on a huge scale, frequently as wages.

Given the mortality levels described above (which is a conservative assumption in view of the fact that the health conditions of the forests of the west coast equatorial area have probably long been worse than elsewhere), the conclu› sion could be drawn that in the centuries past those areas averaging 5 births per woman had experienced population declines averaging over 0.5 per cent per annum, and those averaging 3.5 children declines of over 1.5 per cent per annum. This is inconceivable over any protracted period; the latter population would be halving every forty years, and both situations suggest much larger populations during the earlier years of European contact than has ever been suggested. The conclusion is inescapable that fertility has fallen in the area within comparatively recent times and probably within the period being described in this chapter.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'Much the same doubts could be cast on another of the trade goods, guns.

In the longer run, those areas most advanced in commercialization first developed a commercial, admini› strative and civil infrastructure: port facilities, roads, trading premises, cash cropping and eventually schools and health facilities and possibly declining mortality levels. In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well.

This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.\nIn the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium. Major Christian missionary bodies such as the Church Missionary Society (CMS) of the Church of England and the Lyons-based SociØtØ des Missions Africaines (SMA) of the Roman Catholic Church each employed a mix of European nationals. Father Boghero, who led the SMA in an effort to re› introduce Roman Catholic Christianity to West Africa in the nineteenth century, was an Italian. The pioneer SMA Fathers in most parts of the area which became Nigeria were French, just as it was such British missionaries as Thomas Birch Freeman of the Methodists and Samuel Ajayi Crowther of the CMS who pioneered the work of Christian missions in what was to become French Dahomey (present-day People's Republic of Benin).$^{33}$ British, French, German and Portuguese traders set up businesses adjacent to one another and, as the case of Badagry clearly demonstrated, there were residential quarters for diverse European nationals in the major ports all along the coast of the Bight of Benin.\nTraders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Demography and population movements', 'content': 'The general assumption of demographers is that, given existing agri› cultural systems, technologies and patterns of health care and diseases causing excessive infant mortality, the overall population could not have been expanding much. Normally, a rise of 0.5 per cent per annum (com› pared with the current 2.5 to 3.5), that is to say 50 more births than deaths per thousand annually, could have been expected. That would have doubled the population within a millennium. Given the stability of the population in North Africa, and the intensive agriculture and irrigation in the fertile areas and oases, there was a steady increase of population in periods of prosperity, but this seems to have been balanced by periods of drought and plague, and the population barely remained stable. In the grasslands of the Sudanic zone of West Africa, Central and Southern Africa, the populations were constantly adapting their techniques and achieving a symbiosis between pastoralists and agriculturists, or developing systems of mixed agriculture capable of sustaining a rising population. Similarly, in the more forested areas, systems of agriculture were developed which sustained increases in the population, and by the eighteenth century high densities were achieved in some areas such as the Lower Casamance, the Igbo country in south-eastern Nigeria, the Cameroon grasslands and the Great Lakes region of East Africa.\nHowever, in addition to the occasional natural disasters, the loss of population through the slave trade and the devastating wars associated with it, especially the loss of women of childbearing age over such a long period, was such that the overall population of Africa declined in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, though the loss was unevenly distributed, falling most harshly on those less able to defend themselves, and being con› centrated in that period in West and West-Central Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.048, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Again various societies had had different levels of contact with Europeans or Arabs, the two external forces impinging on East Africa at this time. On the whole, coastal areas had had a longer contact with Europeans and Arabs than the interior areas. Of the interior peoples, three or four groups had had longer contact with the Arabs than the rest. The Akamba in Kenya and the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika were involved in the caravan trade from the interior to the coast - a phenomenon often referred to as long-distance trade.$^{5}$ The Baganda as well as the Wanga in Kenya had also had contact with Arabs trading in ivory and slaves prior to the 1890s. Again the degree of exposure to these outside influences determined the type and extent of resistance put up by various societies.\nApart from these human influences, there were ecological changes taking place in East Africa in the 1890s, which also affected response to foreign penetration. The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all. A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.739, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'GABOON RIVER', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We regret to say that fever has been very prevalent among the Europeans at the Gaboon, and small-pox among the natives.

The want of proper sanitary measures is another reason why the climate of West Africa proves fatal to many European constitutions. When streets and yards, both back and front of houses, are made the receptacles of filth and excrement, of putrified remains of dead dogs, cats, and other animal and vegetable matter, is it to be wondered at that the miasma rising from these dung-heaps eventually becomes fatal to those constantly inhaling it. This is a cause which it would be well for the colonial authorities here to take into their serious consideration, as it is most certainly a preventible one. It was only in 1871, during the administration of Mr. J. Pope Hennessy, that the sanitary condition of Freetown seriously occupied the attention of the Government; but whether that gentleman’s plans have ever been efficiently carried out, and what effects they have hitherto had there, we have no means here to ascertain.\n\n3. The Europeans on the West Coast of Africa, unlike their countrymen in India, South America, and elsewhere, perhaps for the reasons I have already stated, are so careless of their personal comfort, and so intent upon accumulating as much money as they can, that they deny themselves every convenience necessary in a tropical climate. In Sierra Leone, for instance, they live in the town, which is at the sea-shore, instead of on the mountains, where they would enjoy the sea breezes equally as well, and be in a cooler and healthier atmosphere. In support of this view, I will only quote a passage which occurs in a paper read by Mr. Hennessy before the Society of Arts in April, 1873, in which he says: “The mountain district (of Sierra Leone), according to the Registrar-General’s Returns, appears to be as healthy as any part of England, or indeed as Madeira, the climate of which it closely resembles.”\n\nI hope I have clearly shown that the large mortality on the West Coast of Africa is not entirely due to climatic influences, and that a great deal could be done by the Government and the Europeans to counteract and mitigate those influences. As living proofs of what I have stated, I beg to point out Mr. Magnus Smith, Mr. A. Montagu, Mr. Marston, and half-a-dozen others, who have resided in Sierra Leone for fifteen or twenty years without meeting with the same fate as their countrymen, and simply because they have known how to live.—I am, dear Sir,', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Outbreak of Fever in the West African Squadron', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We are enabled to state that, according to the latest accounts received, the fatal cases of fever have been confined to the Active, flying the broad pendant of Commodore Sir William Hewett, V.C., K.C.B.

I deny in toto the statement that upon the seaboard there is not a single healthy acre of ground, and this I shall endeavour to prove; and also point out which (in my opinion as medical officer on the staff attached to the troops serving on this Coast for the last six years) will be the best sanitarium the Government could and ought to select, and where both military and colonial hospitals should be erected.\n\nI am perfectly aware, my Lord, that the Cameroons Mountains, situated in the Bight of Biafra, near to Fernando Po, have been recommended by the late Captain William Allen and Dr. Thompson, of the Niger expedition, and, more recently, by no less a distinguished traveller than Captain Burton. This last gave as his opinion, ""that a few thousands spent at Cameroons or Fernando Po would, calculating only the market value of seamen\'s lives, repay themselves in as many years."" But the pros and cons of that lofty range as a sanitarium must be considered, and officers on the Coast should be consulted before the Home Government attempt to spend a large amount on it. There are many advantages in its favour, as may be seen described in the work of Captain Burton, on ""Abeokuta and the Cameroons,"" but there are also some great disadvantages attaching to it as a military sanitarium.\n\nIts distance from the different military stations on the Coast is one great objection, as it is situated about 400 miles below the last—viz., Lagos. It will be no great consolation for a sick officer—laid up, perhaps, with intractable fever, debility, diarrhœa, or dysentery, to be ordered, say, from the Gambia or Sierra Leone, to the Cameroons Mountains, a distance of about 2,000 miles, in a steam-packet, which is most uncomfortable, and unadapted for the conveyance of the sick during a voyage of eighteen days, in a direction quite opposite to the accustomed route—viz., to Teneriffe, Madeira, or England. The result would be found invariably to be that most of the cases, and certainly all the serious dysenteric cases, would succumb before the patient could reach the mountain of good hope. As a naval sanitarium it would be excellent, as it is in the neighbourhood of the rendezvous of the West African squadron, extending from the Volta to the Island of Ascension; and of the great oil rivers, to which so many English merchant vessels resort.

A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2. Avoid getting chilled by standing or sitting for any length of time when the body is unduly heated, or by neglecting to change underclothing as soon as possible after profuse sweating.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1887#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.715, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE AFRICAN CLIMATE', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Since that time Fernando Po has changed its deadly nature, as the coming chocolate and coffee planters will find.

An English sanitarium on the Cameroons mountain was proposed a score of years ago; nothing has yet been done for the preservation of health and life.

But we have been subject to such misrepresentations when combating stereotyped misstatements as regards West Africa, that we will not allow any one to misunderstand us. The opinions we put forward with regard to the climate of West Africa have not been hastily or crudely formed, nor have they been adopted to serve some temporary or interested purpose. They are the result of evidence that cannot be disproved. They are promulgated by us to remove prejudices which war against our efforts for the advancement of civilization in Africa, and because we feel that they are pregnant with most practical results. We do not, for instance, pretend that the West African climate is not unhealthy. We admit that it is. But we as fearlessly contend that it is not one whit more unhealthy for Europeans than many of the West India Islands, or than Hong Kong, China, or India, &c. These regions are equally liable to visitations of epidemic disease as is West Africa, in the shape of yellow fever, dysentery, &c. We are, moreover, firmly convinced that if ever the day arrives when complete, and not mere partial statistical tables, are compiled, showing the mortality amongst Europeans at the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and even the new settlement at Lagos, the facts fairly and impartially revealed will demonstrate that at least a moiety of the deaths which occur amongst them are not the result of climatic disease, but are chargeable occasionally to accident; more frequently to a lamentable and wanton neglect of ordinary care and precautions; and too often to reckless indulgences, which will in any climate sap the springs of life, and ultimately destroy it. As additional evidences in support of these statements, take, for example, the records with regard to the numerous governors who have served, or are now serving, in West Africa. We find that in most instances they were and are men who had passed middle life before being called upon to administer those Governments, and were consequently far less able to bear up against attacks of fever. Yet, of the thirty-four gentlemen who have governed Sierra Leone from 1792 to 1864, seven only died there in that long period of seventy-two years. Of those seven, one was killed in action, another veteran most unwisely made fruit and vegetables his sole diet; and one of them had previously lived upwards of thirty-five years in the colony, dying at sea, not of disease incident to the climate, but of cancer of the stomach.

It is therefore important to find such mischievous exaggerations combated by a medical officer, who writes of West Africa, not from hearsay evidence, but from the experience derived during a residence of twenty-three years in the colony of Sierra Leone and settlements of the Gold Coast. We make these remarks by way of introducing to more general notice the papers above noted, because they supply much valuable and novel information, not only regarding the diseases to which Europeans and natives are subject in West Africa, but because they furnish an interesting description of the topography of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.\n\nMr. Clarke is of opinion that the climate of West Africa, if fairly tested, can stand comparison in point of healthfulness with most of our colonies in the East or West Indies, where endemic and epidemic fevers, dysentery, with cholera to boot, prevail quite as frequently and fatally. There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years. Comparatively, their number is not small, comprehending persons of all classes—governors, civil and military officers, merchants, and missionaries, with their wives and families. He states ""that formerly many officers in the English, Dutch, and Danish service resided upon the Gold Coast, some fourteen, twenty, and thirty years,* and enjoyed good health, although those in subordinate positions had to remove from one station to another."" The fact ought no longer to be concealed, that half at least of the deaths and incapacities which occur amongst Europeans arise from errors of personal economy, and that the mortality lists are unfairly swelled by ascribing to the climate deaths which have been caused by accident or intemperance.\n\nThe following passages may be adduced as proof that the climate is not to blame for everything:—', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.77, 'probability_score': 0.07, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—I read the paragraph in your paper of this month under the above title, and can add my testimony to the value of “Lamplough’s Pyretic Saline,” if not as a sure preventive, certainly as a deterrent and palliative in African fevers.\n\nIn your remarks, however, I find no mention made of the probable causes of such mortality, which I think is necessary when speaking of the effects of a climate like West Africa, the bad reputation of which is so very much exaggerated. Nor do you make any distinction between the colonies, classing Sierra Leone with Lagos, Gambia, and Cape Coast, which I am sure the facts would not warrant.\n\nTo revert, however, to the causes of mortality on the West Coast of Africa, I am of opinion that there are many influential causes conducing to the same which might be prevented, and I take the liberty of intruding on your valuable space to enumerate one or two of them.\n\n1. The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics. In Brazil, no doubt, some Europeans drink themselves to death, but they are few; the majority, being of a better class, prefer to live well and to enjoy themselves rationally, without making beasts of themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.727, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'West Coast Climate—Yellow Fever—Army and Navy Mismanagement', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'So furious has been the attempt to ""taboo"" or ""put down"" the West Coast of Africa because of its climate, that we have no option but to return to the subject.

Yes, here is new evidence of the fact, that the denunciations hurled by the families of victims, and by journalists ignorant in these matters, upon the climate of certain portions of the globe under British rule or power, in which British soldiers, sailors, and civilians have to serve, ought rather to be heaped on the authorities who so unnecessarily and wantonly sacrifice the lives of their fellow-subjects and fellow-servants.

With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CLIMATE OF WESTERN AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I am not singular in believing that healthy Europeans coming to Africa to reside may do so with comparative safety, if they will only take proper precautions to preserve their health.

For instance, Dr. Baikie, Baron Barth, M. Henri Dufour, Mr. Edward Spenser Burns, and M. L. Abbé Debaize are all noted as having died during their expeditions. The articles also highlight the harsh climate and the lack of proper precautions taken by Europeans, which contributed to the high mortality rates. Additionally, the articles discuss the challenges faced by Europeans in establishing a foothold in Africa, including resistance from local populations and the difficulties of navigating the terrain. These details align with the claim by illustrating the significant risks and challenges associated with European exploration and the civilizing mission in Africa. However, the articles also mention the potential for progress and the belief in an African regeneration, suggesting a more complex view of the colonial mission beyond just its perils. This nuanced perspective provides a broader context to the claim, indicating both the dangers and the aspirations associated with European activities in Africa during this period.",True,1461,Health and Disease,Health and Disease Hardships for European Explorers,"[{'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm, Ascaris infections, schistosomiasis, filariasis and Guinea worm. To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease. Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively. Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s. Nevertheless, tropical medical schools were established in Europe as early as 1897 in Liverpool and London, 1900 in Hamburg, 1901 in Brussels, followed later by Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles, and in Africa by 1912 in Cape Town and 1918 in Dakar."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.\nThis flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated.

Without doubt the upsetting of stable populations, leading in the Congo Free State and elsewhere in Middle Africa to an upsurge in the death rate, the slow reduction in mortality in other parts of the continent during the nineteenth century and generally in this century, and the accelerating nucleation of population in towns and on mining fields owed nearly everything to the industrial revolution and to increasing contact with people from industrial societies. Much of this process would have occurred even without colonial rule: the traders would have provoked trading centres into growth; European medical schools would have become interested in the problem of protecting the traders and others from tropical disease; missionaries would have laid the foundations of a hospital system.\nNevertheless, direct colonial rule certainly speeded up all these processes. Eventually, and certainly towards the end of our period, it helped to reduce the great peaks of mortality by increasingly and effectively importing and utilizing epidemic control technology and creating a modern transport system which could distribute food in areas of famine. The need for administrative centres provided a nucleus for new towns, and colonial administrations' guarantees of personal safety and investment security to the nationals of their metropolitan countries hastened the growth of com› mercial settlements, mining camps and plantations. Without colonial administrations European entrepreneurs might well have been even more rapacious and murderous than they were. Europeans usually justified the colonial penetration by pointing to these achievements. Yet the history of Latin America and China shows that in time most of these gains would have been achieved in any case; the growth of industrialization was irreversible and a modus vivendi with Africa and other developing areas, from which needed raw materials were secured, was essential."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

The slave trade had intensified internecine warfare for over two centuries, leading to cultural devastation on an unprecedented scale. Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent.

As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour.

A more accurate judgement in this writer's opinion is not that colonialism did not do anything positive for Africa, it indeed did. But Europeans did make huge profits in Africa through mining companies, trading houses, banks, shipping lines, plantations and concession companies. Moreover governments held substantial foreign reserves from the colonies in metropolitan countries which must have provided some of the capital for metropolitan development.

When all this is compared with what the African owners of the land, peasant agriculturalists and mine labourers obtained, and the fact that whatever infrastructural and social facilities that were provided had to be paid for by the colonies themselves, one cannot but marvel at the raw deal which colonialism thrust on Africans. Moreover, whatever colonialism did for Africans in Africa, given its opportunities, its resources and the power and influence it wielded in Africa at the time, it could and should have done far more than it did. As even Lloyd admits: 'So much more might perhaps have been done had the development of backward territories been seen by the industrial nations as a first priority'.$^{49}$ It is precisely because colonial rulers not only did not see the development of Africans as their first priority, but did not see it as a priority at all that they stand condemned.

The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence. It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y. Kaniki have concluded that \'colonialism ... produced its own grave-diggers\', while Robin Maugham has maintained that \'on the tombstone of the British Empire\' [in which this racial dis› crimination was most overt] \'may be written ""Lost by snobbery"".\'$^{44}$ Both conclusions are unexceptionable. This racial discrimination also created in some Africans a deep sense of inferiority which Afigbo has defined above quite succintly as \'a tendency to lose confidence in himself and his future in short, a state of mind which at times encouraged an uncritical imitation of', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""Another highly regrettable social impact of colonialism was the deterior› ation that it caused in the status of the woman in Africa.

Nor do you make any distinction between the colonies, classing Sierra Leone with Lagos, Gambia, and Cape Coast, which I am sure the facts would not warrant.\n\nTo revert, however, to the causes of mortality on the West Coast of Africa, I am of opinion that there are many influential causes conducing to the same which might be prevented, and I take the liberty of intruding on your valuable space to enumerate one or two of them.\n\n1. The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics.

Indeed, common sense led them to act in such a manner, otherwise their lives would not have been safe for a day. And as missionaries and pioneers of African civilisation, who have ever equalled the illustrious Moffat and Livingstone? But these were eminently pacific in their whole procedure, even amongst the wildest savages. For instance, there was the fierce African chief, who had been the terror of South Africa for many years, but who under the peaceful influences of the Gospel preached and practised by Moffatt, became changed from the savage nature of the lion to the gentleness of the lamb. On such a man and his fellows the effects of bullets and arms would have been exasperating in the last degree.\n\nOther and later missionaries in Africa, and in general the most successful of their number, have followed on the conciliatory line of action laid down by Moffat and Livingstone; and by their Master before them.\n\nNor has this pacific course been confined to the missionaries. It has been followed by the most successful statesmen and by the shrewdest colonial administrators in Africa. There was, indeed, a time when the bullet, but not Bible, policy had considerable influence in the Cape Colony, and when it was especially fostered by selfish persons, who endeavoured, and more than once with too much success, to drag the Colony and the Mother Country into war with the Kaffirs. A lamentable loss of life and money was the result of this blundering course. But warned by the lessons of the past, later Administrators in South Africa have pursued a more sensible policy, and have treated the native races in a more conciliatory and reasonable manner. The effect has been a development of trade, commerce, colonisation, and religion, incomparably superior to anything attained during the period when the counsels of bullying folly and of private greed were listened to.\n\nIt is from the better and wiser plan of peaceful measures that the people of the Cape Colony, of Natal, and of the Diamond Regions, are not massacred by infuriated natives, who, as a population, greatly exceed them in point of numbers.

Just a little before the discovery of America thousands of the natives of the Congo were baptised by Catholic missionaries, and the Portuguese devoted themselves to the work of African evangelisation and exploration. They knew then as much of interior Africa as is known now after the great exploits of Livingstone and Stanley. There is a map in the Vatican, 300 years old, which gives the general physical relief and the river and lake systems of Africa with more or less accuracy; but the Arab geographers of a century before had described the mountain system, the great lakes, and the course of the Nile. Just about the time that Portugal was establishing a great empire on that continent, America was discovered, and it became the seat of Portuguese Power. Neither Egyptian, Carthaginian, Persian, or Roman influence was allowed to establish itself on that continent. It would seem that no solution of the African problem was to come from alien sources. Africans were not to share the fate of other dark races who have come in contact with the European. Europe was diverted to the Western Hemisphere. The energies of that conquering race were spent in building up a home for themselves on this side. Africa followed in chains.\n\nThe Negro race was to be preserved for a special work in the future. It is probable that if foreign races had been allowed to enter their country they would have been destroyed. So they were brought over to be helpers in America and at the same time to be preserved. Slavery would seem to be a strange school in which to preserve a people; but God has a way of salting as well as purifying by fire. The Europeans found in America an aboriginal race unable to co-operate with them in the labours required for the construction of the new civilisation. The Indians would not work, and have suffered the consequences of that indisposition: they have passed away.

It is nearly as old as recorded  \nhistory. It has interested thinking men in Europe and Asia in  \nall ages. The imagination of the ancients peopled the interior  \nof that country with a race of beings shut out from and needing  \nno intercourse with the rest of mankind—lifted by their purity  \nand simplicity of character above the necessity of intercourse  \nwith other mortals. The Greeks especially had very high con-  \nceptions of the sanctity and spirituality of the interior Africans.  \nIndeed, the religion of some portion of Greece is supposed to  \nhave been introduced from Africa. But leaving the region of  \nmythology, we know that the three highest religions known to  \nmankind—if they had not their origin in Africa—were domiciled  \nthere in the days of their feeble beginnings, Judaism, Christianity,  \nand Mohammedanism.  \nA sacred mystery hung over that continent, and many were  \nthe aspirations of philosophers and poets for some definite  \nknowledge of what was beyond the narrow fringe they saw.\n\nThe mystery still remains. The problem continues unsolved. The conquering races of the world stand perplexed before the difficulties which beset their enterprise of reducing that continent to subjection. Europe has extended her conquests to Australia, New Zealand, and the Archipelagos of the Pacific. But, for hundreds of years, their ships have passed by those tempting regions, where ""Afric\'s sunny fountains roll down their golden sands,"" and have been able to acquire no extensive foothold in that country. The points actually occupied by white men in the equatorial regions of that continent may be represented on the map only by microscopic dots. The bulk of Central Africa is being rapidly subjected to Mohammedanism. That system is, knitting together the conquerors and the conquered into a harmonious whole; and unless Europe gets a thorough understanding of the situation, the gates of missionary enterprise will be closed.

To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures.

Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively. Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s. Nevertheless, tropical medical schools were established in Europe as early as 1897 in Liverpool and London, 1900 in Hamburg, 1901 in Brussels, followed later by Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles, and in Africa by 1912 in Cape Town and 1918 in Dakar."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.795, 'probability_score': 0.056, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""In tropical Africa governmental medicine was long a military concern although small civilian hospitals began to appear in the 1890s. From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo* Basin and Angola', 'section_title': 'Demography, society and politics in high-density areas', 'content': ""The development of more-complex agricultural communities had import› ant consequences for the demography of Central Africa. It is generally considered that communities that gradually take up agriculture and animal husbandry continue for a long time to show a low annual growth rate (between 0.05 and 0.10 per cent), which is fairly close to the known growth rate of hunting and food-gathering communities. On the other hand, communities with a more diversified agriculture have a much higher annual growth rate, put between 0.10 and 0.15 per cent. Figures for a difficult natural environment like that of Africa are unknown: but they are no doubt not very far from this model. Spread over more than two centuries, an increase of this order in the growth rate would have had a considerable effect on the overall population of Central Africa. 6\nCompared with twentieth-century growth rates these figures admittedly seem low. The fact is that in early African communities the death rate remained high. For the nineteenth century the main causes of death are known, but it is impossible to determine the extent of each one's con› tribution to the total.\nFirst, there were historical factors, especially the slave trade and its attendant violence.

The nineteenth century certainly saw the beginnings of medical progress in Central Africa, such as better knowledge of endemic diseases, use of vaccination and more general use of quinine. But this progress remained confined to the circles visited by traders from Angola or the Swahili coast.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered.

By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths. From 50 to 80 per cent have or have had syphilis or yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm,"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': 'until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

Smallpox vaccination was on such a small scale that by the late 1930s a significant reduction of the disease had probably taken place only in the Gold Coast and southern Nigeria. 93 In contrast, contact with Europeans and participation in the First World War ensured that the influenza epidemic of 1918-19 swept through Africa probably resulting in the highest annual death rate this century, although the rise in death rates was probably not as great as in Asia, for many African populations were still protected by comparative isolation. Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The years from the early 1880s to the mid-iojos mark the demographic divide in Africa. At the beginning of the period the continent's population was still sparse, at least by the standards of the Old World. More signifi› cantly it probably was not growing rapidly and evidenced a vulnerability to the kind of pressures, both internal and external, which were being increasingly applied. By about 1935, the population was undoubtedly grow› ing because of increasing control over mortality, and the basis was laid for a doubling over the next third of a century which almost certainly hastened and consolidated independence.\nMany indices can be used to illustrate the changes between the two dates, and some help to explain the demographic transition. In 1880 a European presence inland from the coast was largely restricted to Algeria, where a third of a million migrants, mainly from France, Spain, Italy and Malta, had consolidated the victory of the French army, and South Africa, where a similar number of Europeans, predominantly of Dutch and English extraction, now had a vanguard as far north as the Limpopo river. (See Fig. i.i.) Elsewhere Europeans were beginning to exert control over Egypt and Tunisia, ruled some coastal populations in Senegal and the Gold Coast (now Ghana) and held such enclaves as The Gambia, Sierra Leone, Lagos, Libreville and parts of Angola and Mozambique. By 1935 European administations controlled almost the entire continent (see Fig. 12.2). The half century saw European medical science progressing from an ignorance of the cause of most of Africa's major diseases to an ability to contain or cure most of them; indeed the period ends just as the sulpha drugs were ushering in an era of chemotherapy of great significance for the continent.

Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi. It was not until after the Second World War that technical schools and univer› sity colleges were established in most parts of Africa.

Commerce was one, although whether such activities brought prosperity and the ability to buy food in times of need and perhaps some health care in the few places where it existed to a greater degree than it brought disease arising from increased contact with strangers is debatable. By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent. There were two reasons for the trade: firstly that alcohol could be produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits; secondly, in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, there were real problems about what goods would be accepted in return for the produce of Africa.$^{43}$ Mary Kingsley found the trade spirit pure and likely to do less harm than cannabis,$^{44}$ a view shared by a committee that investigated the liquor trade in içoç.$^{45}$ Spirits were distributed on a huge scale, frequently as wages.

The Akamba in Kenya and the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika were involved in the caravan trade from the interior to the coast - a phenomenon often referred to as long-distance trade.$^{5}$ The Baganda as well as the Wanga in Kenya had also had contact with Arabs trading in ivory and slaves prior to the 1890s. Again the degree of exposure to these outside influences determined the type and extent of resistance put up by various societies.\nApart from these human influences, there were ecological changes taking place in East Africa in the 1890s, which also affected response to foreign penetration. The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all. A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya.

Efforts at modernization were, however, by then overshadowed by the impending threat of Italian Fascist invasion. 76 Thus the period between 1915 and 1935 witnessed a wider spread and a greater degree of economic and social change in Liberia and Ethiopia than before. However, this change did not amount to much and both countries therefore remained economically backward and socially undevel› oped.

It is also difficult to feel that the situation in this region is adequately covered by a recent United Nations' publication writing of'cultural shock' and 'the processes of adjustment'. 71 Eventually the colonial penetration was to lead to a great increase in population.

At Boma, disputes had arisen between Mr. Stanley\'s people and the merchants about the possession of certain lands.

It might be worth while for officers to provide themselves with a small respirator, to be worn when exposed to the night air.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '2. The want of proper sanitary measures is another reason why the climate of West Africa proves fatal to many European constitutions. When streets and yards, both back and front of houses, are made the receptacles of filth and excrement, of putrified remains of dead dogs, cats, and other animal and vegetable matter, is it to be wondered at that the miasma rising from these dung-heaps eventually becomes fatal to those constantly inhaling it. This is a cause which it would be well for the colonial authorities here to take into their serious consideration, as it is most certainly a preventible one. It was only in 1871, during the administration of Mr. J. Pope Hennessy, that the sanitary condition of Freetown seriously occupied the attention of the Government; but whether that gentleman’s plans have ever been efficiently carried out, and what effects they have hitherto had there, we have no means here to ascertain.\n\n3. The Europeans on the West Coast of Africa, unlike their countrymen in India, South America, and elsewhere, perhaps for the reasons I have already stated, are so careless of their personal comfort, and so intent upon accumulating as much money as they can, that they deny themselves every convenience necessary in a tropical climate. In Sierra Leone, for instance, they live in the town, which is at the sea-shore, instead of on the mountains, where they would enjoy the sea breezes equally as well, and be in a cooler and healthier atmosphere. In support of this view, I will only quote a passage which occurs in a paper read by Mr. Hennessy before the Society of Arts in April, 1873, in which he says: “The mountain district (of Sierra Leone), according to the Registrar-General’s Returns, appears to be as healthy as any part of England, or indeed as Madeira, the climate of which it closely resembles.”\n\nI hope I have clearly shown that the large mortality on the West Coast of Africa is not entirely due to climatic influences, and that a great deal could be done by the Government and the Europeans to counteract and mitigate those influences. As living proofs of what I have stated, I beg to point out Mr. Magnus Smith, Mr. A. Montagu, Mr. Marston, and half-a-dozen others, who have resided in Sierra Leone for fifteen or twenty years without meeting with the same fate as their countrymen, and simply because they have known how to live.—I am, dear Sir,', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE CLIMATE OF THE GOLD COAST', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following is taken from an article from the pen of Dr. J. A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2. Avoid getting chilled by standing or sitting for any length of time when the body is unduly heated, or by neglecting to change underclothing as soon as possible after profuse sweating.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1887#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sanitariums for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'But Western Africa has hitherto not been thought worthy of much consideration and attention, and therefore officers who have been sent to command the troops in it have scarcely any means for preserving their health. I deny in toto the statement that upon the seaboard there is not a single healthy acre of ground, and this I shall endeavour to prove; and also point out which (in my opinion as medical officer on the staff attached to the troops serving on this Coast for the last six years) will be the best sanitarium the Government could and ought to select, and where both military and colonial hospitals should be erected.\n\nI am perfectly aware, my Lord, that the Cameroons Mountains, situated in the Bight of Biafra, near to Fernando Po, have been recommended by the late Captain William Allen and Dr. Thompson, of the Niger expedition, and, more recently, by no less a distinguished traveller than Captain Burton. This last gave as his opinion, ""that a few thousands spent at Cameroons or Fernando Po would, calculating only the market value of seamen\'s lives, repay themselves in as many years."" But the pros and cons of that lofty range as a sanitarium must be considered, and officers on the Coast should be consulted before the Home Government attempt to spend a large amount on it. There are many advantages in its favour, as may be seen described in the work of Captain Burton, on ""Abeokuta and the Cameroons,"" but there are also some great disadvantages attaching to it as a military sanitarium.\n\nIts distance from the different military stations on the Coast is one great objection, as it is situated about 400 miles below the last—viz., Lagos. It will be no great consolation for a sick officer—laid up, perhaps, with intractable fever, debility, diarrhœa, or dysentery, to be ordered, say, from the Gambia or Sierra Leone, to the Cameroons Mountains, a distance of about 2,000 miles, in a steam-packet, which is most uncomfortable, and unadapted for the conveyance of the sick during a voyage of eighteen days, in a direction quite opposite to the accustomed route—viz., to Teneriffe, Madeira, or England. The result would be found invariably to be that most of the cases, and certainly all the serious dysenteric cases, would succumb before the patient could reach the mountain of good hope. As a naval sanitarium it would be excellent, as it is in the neighbourhood of the rendezvous of the West African squadron, extending from the Volta to the Island of Ascension; and of the great oil rivers, to which so many English merchant vessels resort. Those on the Sierra Leone station should, however, have the advantage of the sanitarium about to be proposed.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—I read the paragraph in your paper of this month under the above title, and can add my testimony to the value of “Lamplough’s Pyretic Saline,” if not as a sure preventive, certainly as a deterrent and palliative in African fevers.\n\nIn your remarks, however, I find no mention made of the probable causes of such mortality, which I think is necessary when speaking of the effects of a climate like West Africa, the bad reputation of which is so very much exaggerated. Nor do you make any distinction between the colonies, classing Sierra Leone with Lagos, Gambia, and Cape Coast, which I am sure the facts would not warrant.\n\nTo revert, however, to the causes of mortality on the West Coast of Africa, I am of opinion that there are many influential causes conducing to the same which might be prevented, and I take the liberty of intruding on your valuable space to enumerate one or two of them.\n\n1. The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics. In Brazil, no doubt, some Europeans drink themselves to death, but they are few; the majority, being of a better class, prefer to live well and to enjoy themselves rationally, without making beasts of themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MISSIONARY VICTIMS TO AFRICAN CLIMATE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The list of missionary victims to the climate in Africa will, we fear, be largely increased in the Eastern and Lake countries.

It is therefore important to find such mischievous exaggerations combated by a medical officer, who writes of West Africa, not from hearsay evidence, but from the experience derived during a residence of twenty-three years in the colony of Sierra Leone and settlements of the Gold Coast. We make these remarks by way of introducing to more general notice the papers above noted, because they supply much valuable and novel information, not only regarding the diseases to which Europeans and natives are subject in West Africa, but because they furnish an interesting description of the topography of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.\n\nMr. Clarke is of opinion that the climate of West Africa, if fairly tested, can stand comparison in point of healthfulness with most of our colonies in the East or West Indies, where endemic and epidemic fevers, dysentery, with cholera to boot, prevail quite as frequently and fatally. There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years. Comparatively, their number is not small, comprehending persons of all classes—governors, civil and military officers, merchants, and missionaries, with their wives and families. He states ""that formerly many officers in the English, Dutch, and Danish service resided upon the Gold Coast, some fourteen, twenty, and thirty years,* and enjoyed good health, although those in subordinate positions had to remove from one station to another."" The fact ought no longer to be concealed, that half at least of the deaths and incapacities which occur amongst Europeans arise from errors of personal economy, and that the mortality lists are unfairly swelled by ascribing to the climate deaths which have been caused by accident or intemperance.\n\nThe following passages may be adduced as proof that the climate is not to blame for everything:—', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The frightful condition in which the slaves are landed from the captured slavers at Sierra Leone is vividly depicted:—\n\n""At the period I took charge of the Kissy Hospitals (1837) the slave-trade was in active operation, consequently great numbers of liberated Africans were constantly received into hospital. It was a most distressing sight to witness the arrival of these poor creatures; and it is necessary to make a few preliminary remarks in order clearly to understand the difficulties with which the medical officers had to contend. The appearance of the slaves when landed was most striking. In some the expression of the countenance indicated sufferings, moral and physical, of the most profound and agonising nature. Others of them gazed vacantly around them in the most utter helplessness. Occasionally, among the newly-arrived groups all sense of suffering was merged in melancholic or raving madness. The wizened, shrunk, and skinny features were lighted up by the hollow, feverish eye. The belly was, as it were, tacked to the back, whilst the hip-bones protruded, and, in some cases, became the seat of foul, sloughing ulcers. The hand and skinny fingers seemed much elongated by the great and neglected growth of the nails, and they were so deplorably emaciated, that the skin appeared tensely stretched over, and tied down to the skeleton. The legs refused to perform their functions, and they reeled and tottered about from sheer debility. Their squalor and extreme wretchedness was heightened, in many cases, by the particoloured evacuations with which their bodies were besmeared. When large numbers of the sick were suffering from dysentery, the condition of the wards and yards in the morning was extremely loathsome. This was in a great degree unavoidable, as the sick were too weak to crawl from their mats to the commode, although everything was done under the surgeons\' orders to keep the wards as clean and wholesome as the crowded state of the hospital would admit of."" In a word, ""the moral and physical causes of depression were often so overwhelming, and so intensely concentrated, that the combination produced disease in such formidable shapes as to be beyond remedy. The mortality was consequently very great; many persons brought to the hospital in the last stage of disease died a few hours after their arrival; others even expired by the way. A large proportion died within a few days; and as the names of all these persons were recorded in the hospital books, the percentage of deaths was thereby largely increased.""\n\n*(To be continued.)*', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of West Africa—Gold Mining—The Labour Question', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Now, first, as regards the climate and mode of living.

But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers.

The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The African Royal Mail steamer Africa, which arrived at Liverpool on 6th February, reports that trade on the Coast was dull, but health, though the weather was remarkably hot, fairly good.

To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel.

The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled.

Sierra Leone became their training ground. In addition to spreading Christianity and civilization the missions had to fight the slave trade, especially at Rio Pongos. But local slave-traders suspected these people of spying for the colonial government: they set fire to buildings of the Church Missionary Society who abandoned the field. In the colony itself, where political authority was conscious of its humanitarian mission, the missionaries were not unconscious of politics. MacCarthy put them in charge of the villages of freed slaves.

Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.599, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'Much the same doubts could be cast on another of the trade goods, guns.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered. Yellow fever epidemics have occurred from Senegal to Sudan at unpredictable intervals. By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

Lugard laid much stress on this, claiming that Nigeria's more deserted areas were evidence of periodic devastation.$^{48}$ Certainly there was some insecurity in pre-colonial Africa, as is evidenced by the defensive location of many villages from which 'downhill movements' of farmers to better agricultural locations occurred after their safety could be guaranteed. 49 The claim of greater security was true in the long run but highly questionable during the first decades. African instability had been exacerbated by the European contact. In any case it was almost certainly exaggerated by both European administrators and missionaries, each seeking to justify the kind of new order that they had brought. The object of much of the raiding was not people but cattle and grain,$^{50}$ although without question the owners of such property ran risks in protecting it. What was less frequently emphasized by the new regimes was the heavy loss of life arising in parts of Africa from their intervention. The deaths were rarely a product of the original extension of administration, but rather of the suppression of subsequent revolts and of the ensuing punitive expeditions which apparently often inflicted most damage because of starvation resulting from the upsetting of the subsistence farming cycle. Examples include the thousands killed in Senegal in 1886 when opposing the building of a railway$^{51}$ and in the Ndebele war in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in 1893, the long-drawn-out suppression of the BÆtetela rebellion in the Congo Free State from 1895 to 1907, and a series of episodes in German South West Africa (now Namibia) between 1901 and 1906.

The other is the possibility that the population has not been stationary, but has been averaging a rate of growth of up to 0.5 per cent per annum for several centuries (for reasons which will be discussed below). The full range of possibilities allows us to describe a society where women averaged 5.5-7 live births yielding a birth rate of 42-50 per thousand, and where the expectation of life at birth was 20-30 years yielding a death rate of 38-50 per thousand and an infant mortality rate of 250-375 deaths per thousand live births. A medium assumption might be a situation where women averaged little more than six live births, where population growth averaged 0.33 per cent, where the expectation of life at birth was about 22.5 years (about the level of Rome at the end of the Republic)$^{20}$ and where the crude birth rate was about 48 per thousand, the crude death rate 45 per thousand and the infant mortality rate 300-350 per thousand.

For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces.

This uplands shift in population continues today. It involves transitions in production and diet among those pressing upland, the compression of population in the higher elevations, and the expansion of Luo-speaking communities.

The occasional markets offered some relief, permitting the exchange of cattle, grazed in the lowlands, for grain and root crops grown more successfully at the higher elevations.

Some of the most callous riffraff of Europe drifted in to become agents for the concessionaires, and to an extraordinary degree they were permitted to utilize the apparatus of the colonial administration including its army, police and courts. Taxation and compulsory labour, although in theory limited, were reinterpreted by the agents to mean such continuous work that crop planting and, consequently, diet suffered very considerably. The population grew reluctant to toil collecting, and to hand over what had always been communally theirs. Imprisonment was an unsatisfactory punishment as it reduced the available labour. Instead, floggings, mutila› tion, the taking as hostages of women and children, the burning of villages and a considerable amount of killing were employed.

Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

Instead of being constant, incessant, untiring, earnest, unyielding in demanding that they shall be effectively represented in the said Legislative Council, by having granted to them the right and power to elect such a proportion of its members as shall give them that control over the revenue and expenditure of the colony, and in making of local laws and regulations, to which they are now entitled by the degree of education which exists among them, by their numbers, their wealth, and the amount of their public revenue, the people lay down submissively at the feet of those unworthy officials whose removal from among them they have heretofore demanded, and wait with open mouths and eager eyes for that delicious crumb of title ""Honourable,"" which nauseates us in Liberia, and which, under present circumstances and conditions, it is a deep disgrace rather than an honour to receive in Sierra Leone. Trial by jury, in all cases and causes in the superior courts, which no people caring to be free would be content to live without, is no longer the burthen of Sierra Leone letters on our table.

But we never thus acted, and have not, therefore, any such error to confess; and in the few observations we may make relative to the new official, the now gazetted Queen\'s Advocate, we shall not deviate from the dictates of those principles which have ever guided us in our work for the African people. We publish in another column the farewell remarks of an editor of a British Columbian newspaper. We gather from it that the new Queen\'s Advocate has a wife and family. Will these accompany him to Sierra Leone? If they do, we hope they will be blessed with health; and will exercise a beneficial social influence. But the change from the dry atmosphere and invigorating winters of British Columbia to the humidity, and almost perpetual enervating heat of Sierra Leone, seems to us too great and extreme a one to promise healthy results. We look in vain for inducements to such a voluntary change in any other direction than that of increased pay. Mr. Alston therefore comes to Sierra Leone because it is a more lucrative field of service, and—must we say it?—because he has given satisfactory proof of that official docility which is so dear to the little terrestrial divinities who hold the supreme authority in British colonies and settlements. The eulogium which we copy from the British Columbian newspapers sets forth this docility in very strong light. ""But for his official appointment there, Mr. Alston would no doubt have been one of the most advanced Liberals of that colony."" We, of course, do not know whether this delightful official docility was pointed out by Sir Arthur to the authorities in Downing-street, as being invaluable in such an atmosphere as that of Sierra Leone, or by those authorities to Sir Arthur, as being most precious for an Administrator-in-Chief. But this we do know—viz., that the Africans of Sierra Leone have no right or title to look to such a man for help toward achieving those public rights and liberties which they are entitled to possess. Having sold their public desires for the unsubstantial pottage we have before mentioned, they will not have any right to complain of this. But they have still a right to expect that he will show himself impartial in the public duties he has to perform; that no deprecation of the African shall appear in his public or private demeanour; and that he will not endeavour to wrest justice in favour of the European as a European, against the African as an African. A conscientious and equitable Queen\'s Advocate may do much to control prejudiced, weak, or venal judges, whenever it becomes his duty to appear officially before any such persons. We will only now beg to express the hope that Mr. Alston may be a man of this stamp, notwithstanding the political subserviency of which he has given such satisfactory evidence in British Columbia; and that we may find in future just occasion to praise, rather than to blame the now recently-appointed Queen\'s Advocate.'}, {'id': 3085, 'article_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'full_section_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'last_edit_date': '03-29-1876', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'issue_date': '01_05_1876', 'content': '2. The want of proper sanitary measures is another reason why the climate of West Africa proves fatal to many European constitutions. When streets and yards, both back and front of houses, are made the receptacles of filth and excrement, of putrified remains of dead dogs, cats, and other animal and vegetable matter, is it to be wondered at that the miasma rising from these dung-heaps eventually becomes fatal to those constantly inhaling it. This is a cause which it would be well for the colonial authorities here to take into their serious consideration, as it is most certainly a preventible one. It was only in 1871, during the administration of Mr. J. Pope Hennessy, that the sanitary condition of Freetown seriously occupied the attention of the Government; but whether that gentleman’s plans have ever been efficiently carried out, and what effects they have hitherto had there, we have no means here to ascertain.\n\n3.

In Sierra Leone, for instance, they live in the town, which is at the sea-shore, instead of on the mountains, where they would enjoy the sea breezes equally as well, and be in a cooler and healthier atmosphere. In support of this view, I will only quote a passage which occurs in a paper read by Mr. Hennessy before the Society of Arts in April, 1873, in which he says: “The mountain district (of Sierra Leone), according to the Registrar-General’s Returns, appears to be as healthy as any part of England, or indeed as Madeira, the climate of which it closely resembles.”\n\nI hope I have clearly shown that the large mortality on the West Coast of Africa is not entirely due to climatic influences, and that a great deal could be done by the Government and the Europeans to counteract and mitigate those influences.

In the place of a flat, low-lying district I found a mountainous tract of country, formed by two rivers which nearly intersect it. The general appearance of this Sierra is picturesque in the extreme. The sky line is broken by the irregular outline of a number of conical peaks, covered to their summits with lofty forests, which give to the distant scenery a rich and romantic appearance. Freetown is situated on the shore of a beautiful bay, hemmed in by a grand amphitheatre of hills, covered with vegetation. The distance between the town and the base of the mountains varies from three-quarters of a mile to a mile and a half, the intervening space being broken by numerous grass-clad undulations.\n\nHills ascend almost in regular gradation until they reach the highest peak, and as they are well wooded, the *coup d'œil* is striking and beautiful. A fairer situation for a town can scarcely be imagined, and if the sad experience of the past did not teach us the contrary, it would be pronounced healthy. There is no room to doubt, however, that Sierra Leone is extremely unhealthy, and epidemics of fever occur from time to time which sweep off large numbers of the population. This fever is peculiarly deadly to Europeans, and at the time when there was a European garrison the mortality was immense, whole families being occasionally carried off during one visitation. Happily, few Europeans are now sent to this deadly climate, and the number is yearly decreasing. At the census of 1881 there were only 160 resident whites in the whole of Sierra Leone. The colony is garrisoned by half a West India Regiment, and a considerable naval force is maintained on the coast to protect British interests.""}, {'id': 6194, 'article_title': 'THE GEOGRAPHY OF SIERRA LEONE.', 'full_section_title': 'THE GEOGRAPHY OF SIERRA LEONE.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1892#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_04_1892', 'content': 'At a meeting of the Royal Geographical Society on March 14, a paper by Mr. G.

On the right hand was the low-lying cape with its lighthouse, backed with dense foliage. And from this point to the anchorage of Freetown, four miles up the estuary, there is a succession of charming bays and creeks, the shores covered with dense foliage from the water\'s edge up to the hills, which rose to a height of 1,800 ft.; and beyond them towered the Sugarloaf upwards of 2,500 ft. above the sea level. The streets of Freetown were well planned, but the town itself was badly situated at the foot of the hills, which protected it from the pure south-westerly sea-breeze. The winds generally appeared to eddy over the town, and to this the unhealthiness of Freetown was in some measure due. At an average distance of eighty to 100 miles from the coast the mountains rose abruptly. The intervening alluvial plain was undulating, and composed of laterite; the valleys consisting of a mixture of clay and sand. Much of this land was under water during the rains. Commencing on the coast line, the vegetation consisted of a dense impenetrable bush, with numerous palm and other tall trees; this gradually gave way to large plains, covered with a cane grass, with a few trees in the higher portions. Nearing the mountains, the soil became darker and much richer, and here rice was prolific and the kola tree abounded.\n\nTo the south of Freetown was Sherbro\' Island. The delta of the Jong, Bum Kittam, and Bagru rivers formed what was called the Sherbro\' river, and separated the island from the mainland. This delta was one vast mangrove swamp; foetid mud spits, submerged at every tide, were covered with mangrove trees, and formed numerous islands, the home of the crocodile and water-fowl. Bonthe, the principal town and seat of government of the district, was situated at the east end of the island, was about 100 miles from Freetown. The island was low lying, and intersected by numerous creeks, the so-called Black river dividing it in two. Except on its seaboard, where it was fringed with mud banks covered with mangrove, the interior consisted of undulating sand ridges lying parallel to the sea beach, the hollows of which were full of water.'}, {'id': 6311, 'article_title': 'Proposed Light Railway for Sierra Leone', 'full_section_title': 'Proposed Light Railway for Sierra Leone', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1893#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_04_1893', 'content': '\n\nDr. Lamprey then read his paper, in the course of which he said he had had many opportunities of visiting the interior, as far as the limits of the colony of Sierra Leone, and he was struck with the magnificence and productiveness of this territory. As a field for colonisation the region has proved unhealthy for Europeans. But on the slopes of the mountain ranges an area is found where a northern race may find a suitable climate, and where the native race enjoy excellent health, and he hoped these plateaus would mark British residencies and native towns and villages. The exports had increased recently, whilst shipments of skins, palm kernels, ground nuts, rice, and valuable timbers were much in demand. Forest trees were abundant, and many of them of great commercial value, such as teak and mahogany. As an emporium of commerce, as a coaling station, with the finest natural harbour on the windward and leeward coast, between the Cape Verde Islands and Fernando Po, Sierra Leone possesses greater natural advantages than any other colony, but does not appear to have gone ahead as fast as some of the more progressive possessions in this region. There was no civiliser like a railway, and to construct a light handy line of railway in a country was to double the revenue and to create an export and import trade in districts where at present it was impossible to establish commercial undertakings. Various schemes had been recommended from time to time. In any case the money would have to be raised as cheaply as possible and the work commenced without further delay. There were many merchants and traders interested in this line of light railway, who were willing to assist in the furtherance of the work, particularly as it is probable that the undertaking will prove profitable and a safe investment for their money. The materials for sleepers could be cut in the forests, whilst stone for bridges is obtainable by quarrying at no great depth. In tropical countries the metallic permanent way has been much employed, in which the sleepers are of iron, and the narrow gauge system, permitting of a speed of 15 to 20 miles an hour, appeared to be the most suitable speed for such a railway. Light railways are specially useful when the country is mountainous and sharp curves and steep gradients had to be faced. As the line would pass through a country of great agricultural advantages, and cross many water highways, it would open up a vast territory teeming with abundance of natural productions. The line would pass over rich alluvial plains extending in all directions. Further there was a vast extent of virgin land, and the whole of this stretch of country when traversed by the railway would become the home of a greatly increased agricultural population. On much of the land vast tracts of timber exist, of great value in the near future, and much interest is shown already in the development of this industry. The traffic on the proposed line would consist of timber, grain, cattle, and native produce, passenger traffic, mails, stores, building materials, and manufactured goods from Manchester, Sheffield, Birmingham, and Liverpool. The unhealthiness of the coast was left behind, and on the higher plateaus the climate improves, inviting settlement. There were hills and grassy plains where vast herds of cattle are located, and which, but for the internecine native wars, would be densely populated. The frontier of Sierra Leone was not definitely settled, although the boundaries were practically known, and now the best thing that could be done was to open up and develop the country. The extent of the colony of Sierra Leone had been estimated at about 15,000 square miles, and the population about 275,000 inhabitants, or eighteen to the square mile, the revenue being £90,000 a year at present. On the peninsula of Sierra Leone were represented the intellectual and educated classes of Western Africa, having all the privileges of an English community, united by strong feelings, and bound by ties of devotion and loyalty. This population had been estimated at 60,000 inhabitants, who, but for their insular position, would have long since distributed themselves over the mainland. Their markets would be now open to the world, and thereby increase the revenue of the Colony, and the civilisation of the interior tribes. The Government had yet to be approached on the subject of a scheme for railway extension for the West African colonies. So great were the possibilities that these colonies should at once sanction the opening up of the interior by light railways. Should it become the policy of the Colony to encourage the extension of trade with the interior by forming railways, roads, and telegraphs, he ventured to hazard the opinion that this could best be done by a line of light railway extension. The importance of a light railway such as this had been admitted for years, and the difficulties which appear to stand in the way will not, he hoped, prevent its being carried out.'}, {'id': 6834, 'article_title': 'HEALTH ON THE WEST COAST.', 'full_section_title': 'HEALTH ON THE WEST COAST.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_04_1897#article-7', 'issue_date': '05_04_1897', 'content': 'Recently, in the House of Commons, Mr. Price asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies whether he has any confirmation of the report that during the first seven months of 1896, out of about twenty English officials in the colony of Sierra Leone, there were three deaths and five cases in which the officials had to be invalided home; whether officials have to serve fifteen months at Sierra Leone before obtaining leave, whereas in the Gold Coast Colony they have only to serve twelve months; and whether, seeing that Europeans are particularly subject to illness during the later months of their stay on the coast, the Colonial Office can see its way to making the rules as to leave in Sierra Leone the same as in the Gold Coast Colony.\n\nThe Right Hon.

The opinions we put forward with regard to the climate of West Africa have not been hastily or crudely formed, nor have they been adopted to serve some temporary or interested purpose. They are the result of evidence that cannot be disproved. They are promulgated by us to remove prejudices which war against our efforts for the advancement of civilization in Africa, and because we feel that they are pregnant with most practical results. We do not, for instance, pretend that the West African climate is not unhealthy. We admit that it is. But we as fearlessly contend that it is not one whit more unhealthy for Europeans than many of the West India Islands, or than Hong Kong, China, or India, &c. These regions are equally liable to visitations of epidemic disease as is West Africa, in the shape of yellow fever, dysentery, &c. We are, moreover, firmly convinced that if ever the day arrives when complete, and not mere partial statistical tables, are compiled, showing the mortality amongst Europeans at the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and even the new settlement at Lagos, the facts fairly and impartially revealed will demonstrate that at least a moiety of the deaths which occur amongst them are not the result of climatic disease, but are chargeable occasionally to accident; more frequently to a lamentable and wanton neglect of ordinary care and precautions; and too often to reckless indulgences, which will in any climate sap the springs of life, and ultimately destroy it. As additional evidences in support of these statements, take, for example, the records with regard to the numerous governors who have served, or are now serving, in West Africa. We find that in most instances they were and are men who had passed middle life before being called upon to administer those Governments, and were consequently far less able to bear up against attacks of fever. Yet, of the thirty-four gentlemen who have governed Sierra Leone from 1792 to 1864, seven only died there in that long period of seventy-two years. Of those seven, one was killed in action, another veteran most unwisely made fruit and vegetables his sole diet; and one of them had previously lived upwards of thirty-five years in the colony, dying at sea, not of disease incident to the climate, but of cancer of the stomach.

A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2.

Similarly, The African Times reports on cholera outbreaks in Bathurst and smallpox along the coast, underscoring the prevalence and deadliness of these diseases. Adverse weather conditions are noted in both sources, with the textbook mentioning droughts and famines in East Africa during the 1890s, while the news articles describe the Grandy Expedition's struggles with stormy weather and the missionaries' hardships in St. Paul de Loanda due to fever. Potential conflicts with local populations are discussed in the textbook, which describes social upheavals, witchcraft accusations, and hostility among trading factions, whereas The African Times implies such conflicts through the anticipation of trouble due to smallpox and the logistical challenges faced by Dr. Livingstone. Both sources emphasize the substantial financial and personal sacrifices required, with the textbook noting the heavy investments by European powers and the complex social and political landscapes navigated by missionaries, and the news articles highlighting fundraising efforts for expeditions and the missionaries' dire financial situations. However, the textbook does not explicitly mention the personal sacrifices of individual explorers and missionaries, and the news articles do not explicitly cite conflicts with local populations as a significant challenge.

Additionally, the text highlights adverse weather conditions, such as droughts and famines in East Africa during the 1890s, which would have posed significant challenges to European ventures. The potential for conflicts with local populations is also noted, as the text describes social upheavals, witchcraft accusations, and hostility among trading factions, which could have led to conflicts with Europeans. Furthermore, the text discusses the substantial financial and personal sacrifices required, as European powers invested heavily in their African campaigns, and missionaries had to navigate complex social and political landscapes. However, the text does not explicitly mention the personal sacrifices of individual explorers and missionaries, which is a slight difference from the claim. Overall, the textbook provides a comprehensive view of the challenges faced by Europeans in Africa, aligning closely with the claim.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that European explorers and missionaries in 19th-century Africa faced significant challenges.

The adverse weather conditions are highlighted in the Grandy Expedition's experience with stormy weather, and the missionaries' hardships in St. Paul de Loanda, where many succumbed to fever. Potential conflicts with local populations are implied in the anticipation of trouble due to smallpox and the need for influence to secure porters for Dr. Livingstone's supplies.

To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures.

Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively.

Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel.

The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion.

The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces. In some areas labour was recruited from overseas, such as the importation of Indians to build the Mombasa-Uganda railway at the beginning of the present century and to cultivate sugar in Natal from as early as i860. Everywhere there was movement of labour either to concentrate it in places where it was needed or because some African peoples were regarded as better or more willing workers either because of their longer contact with a commercial economy or because of age-old features of their specific cultures."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Political structures', 'content': ""This effort at self-development was perhaps most prominent in the realm of political structures and state power. The grand lesson of the slave trade era long driven home in West and Central Africa, and being learnt in East Africa in the course of the nineteenth century, was that the way to survive and perhaps even profit from the slave trade was to strengthen the structures and military basis of state power.\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, as we have noted in most parts of Africa, 'the political and economic structures ... seemed to have a certain fragility about them. There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority. In the words of K. Arhin and J. Ki-Zerbo describing the Voltaic regions: During the nineteenth century, political instability and population movements were widespread. Brutal massacres and secessionist move› ments were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority... Some notable exceptions notwithstanding, the frequency and extent of these conflicts grew and the tendency towards social dislocation was undoubtedly linked with the growing opportunities available to the peripheral powers and the rebels to obtain arms and use them to challenge the reigning chiefs. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Economic and social change in Liberia and Ethiopia, 1915-35 > Ethiopia', 'content': 'the medical field, mainly by missionaries, notably the United Presbyterian Church of North America, the Seventh Adventist Mission, and the Italian Catholic Mission, all of which operated hospitals in Addis Ababa, while the Sudan Interior Mission ran a leprosarium at Akaki.$^{75}$ Other developments included the creation of a small civil service, partly formed with students returning from abroad, which received salaries instead of the revenues from fiefs, and the increasing replacement of tribute in kind by taxes in cash. A decree to curtail labour services from the peasant was enacted in 1934, and legislation for the reform of the land tax in 1935. Efforts at modernization were, however, by then overshadowed by the impending threat of Italian Fascist invasion. 76 Thus the period between 1915 and 1935 witnessed a wider spread and a greater degree of economic and social change in Liberia and Ethiopia than before. However, this change did not amount to much and both countries therefore remained economically backward and socially undevel› oped. Finally, investment by foreign nationals and firms in commercial, agricultural and mining enterprises was greater in Liberia than in Ethiopia; and while it aided the processes of modernization, it also led to greater foreign control of the Liberian economy than was the case in Ethiopia.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Demography and population movements', 'content': 'The effects of this loss of population are still to be fully explored, and remain a subject of speculation and of active controversy.$^{6}$ Although the rapid expansion of population against the background of inelastic resources and stagnant, or diminishing, productivity is today regarded as one of the most prominent features of underdevelopment,$^{7}$ that is so in the context of a structurally dependent economy. In the freer economies of the early nineteenth century, underpopulation was definitely a factor of under› development. It is true that some economies appear to have gained some› thing from the slave trade when compared with their neighbours: they managed to remain resilient by exploiting the weakness of their neighbours, thus sustaining their relative prosperity long enough to build up stable systems of political economy in which the challenge of rising population generated increased productivity and further development.

Due to a by no means unusual time-lag, European decisions to abolish the slave trade did not prevent it from reaching a paroxysm in the course of the nineteenth century in a number of countries on the Niger Bend and in the upper basin of the various affluents of the Volta. Emancipation by the state and reintegration into lineage groups did little to reduce the destructive effects of this scourge, which was not to abate until the end of the nineteenth century. In fact, those countries whose economies had been kept going by the 'ports of the desert' at the end of the caravan routes were now enclosed and isolated, being separated from the coast by other states, at a time when basic trading patterns were collapsing. In such circumstances they were bound, slowly but inexorably, to fall into decline.\nIn these circumstances, as often happens in periods of crisis, social divisions were exacerbated, transforming the relatively egalitarian struc› tures that had been characteristic of the societies of the Sahel during their period of ascendancy. Another factor was the evolution of the religious movements which, after the tolerance towards traditional cults shown during the preceding centuries, had adopted a more intransigent attitude as a result of the djihad, which had triumphed in Liptako and had swept through the Bambara states.

I determined if possible to go on myself and see them off. Captain Tucker, commanding H.M.S. Columbine, on my request, kindly offered to place his ship at my disposal for this purpose. On reaching Bagamozo I found that the men referred to were still living in the village, while Arab caravans were setting off on the same journey. It is true that porters this year are difficult to obtain, few of the people of Unyamwezi having come down, in consequence of deaths last year from cholera among their friends. However, by using my influence with the Arabs, I succeeded at once in sending off all but four loads, and followed inland one day\'s journey myself. The remaining four loads I arranged on my return were to be taken as far as Unyamgambe by an Arab caravan, and then sent on to Ujiji by Sandbin Salim, the governor. Once fairly off on the road there is little to induce these people to delay, whereas at Bagamozo, living in good huts, and among their own people, and think that there unknown they might enjoy themselves, and earn monthly pay, had I not gone in person they might have loitered yet several months. While passing along the trade route in the short excursion I made from Bagamozo we met several caravans on their way from Unyamwezi, Urori, &c., and by questioning the natives as well as the leaders, I found that no news had been received lately at Unyamgambe and Ujiji, and nothing had been heard of Dr. Livingstone. All were aware that he had gone on a journey from which he had not yet returned up to the latest dates. The country I passed through after crossing the river Kingani was like a beautiful park and woodland, full of all sorts of big game, including the giraffe, eland, zebra, hartebeeste, wilde beeste, &c., some of which I shot not more than twelve miles from the coast town of Bagamozo.

The party went out under the auspices of an American Missionary Society, and was in charge of the American M.E. Bishop Taylor. According to accounts which from time to time have been received in England, the missionaries have had to undergo terrible hardships, and the latest information shows that those of the party who are alive are in a most deplorable condition. The party, on leaving Liverpool, included men, women, and children, and were evidently totally unacquainted with the nature of the country they were going to. In a very short time after their arrival many of them were stricken down with fever, and soon death terminated the sufferings of several. The missionaries appear to have been ill-provided with funds, and although two or three of the party have returned home, they were only enabled to do so by the consideration of the English steamship companies trading to the port. A gentleman who has been engaged in trading at St. Paul de Loanda for some time past has just arrived in England, and from him some very sad facts have been obtained. So badly off were the party at latest accounts that they had sent a request to the trading houses to be given the leavings of their tables. Many of the party, if they acted on the promptings of their own feelings, would return to America, but they were afraid of being accused of acting in their own interests, and abandoning the noble work they went out to pursue.

Out of the small population of Bathurst no less than 1,100 had already fallen victims to this fearful malady, which the African constitution, unaided, seems to have no power to resist. In the majority of cases death ensues within five or six hours. There seems to be one universal voice of condemnation as regards the official conduct of the Administrator. If ever there was an occasion when public revenue derived from Customs' duties (as they are here) ought to be unsparingly applied to arrest the progress of disease and alleviate the sufferings of a people, surely this was one; but although we see by the estimates that this small colony can afford, or is made to afford, nearly 10,000l. a year in official salaries, the Administrator, if he has not entirely sealed up the colonial chest against the demands of suffering humanity, has at least only allowed assistance in such driblets, and in so inefficient a manner, that no small share of the frightful mortality is charged openly against him by all classes of persons in the colony, from the European merchant down to the meanest native. Experience everywhere, as Admiral Patey must have well known, has established the efficacy of preventive measures in arresting the course of Asiatic cholera, provided those measures are of the right kind, and are vigorously and unsparingly applied; but little or nothing, so far as we can learn, seems to have been done by him to prevent the invasion and spread of this disease at Bathurst. The culpable parsimony and inefficiency of one man have thus brought disease and a horrible death into the homes of hundreds. Hitherto we do not hear that any European has died in Bathurst of this fell disease, but many were suffering under premonitory symptoms. The medical men in the colony (Dr. Jeans and Waters) seem to be doing their duty; we were prepared to expect this by their straightforward conduct in the Gordon case, which has no doubt brought down upon them the official ire. Dr. J. Africanus Horton, S.A.S., has, we hear from Cape Coast, been ordered up to Bathurst, and we know that he will not be found wanting in humanity or zeal.

The want of proper sanitary measures is another reason why the climate of West Africa proves fatal to many European constitutions. When streets and yards, both back and front of houses, are made the receptacles of filth and excrement, of putrified remains of dead dogs, cats, and other animal and vegetable matter, is it to be wondered at that the miasma rising from these dung-heaps eventually becomes fatal to those constantly inhaling it. This is a cause which it would be well for the colonial authorities here to take into their serious consideration, as it is most certainly a preventible one. It was only in 1871, during the administration of Mr. J. Pope Hennessy, that the sanitary condition of Freetown seriously occupied the attention of the Government; but whether that gentleman’s plans have ever been efficiently carried out, and what effects they have hitherto had there, we have no means here to ascertain.\n\n3. The Europeans on the West Coast of Africa, unlike their countrymen in India, South America, and elsewhere, perhaps for the reasons I have already stated, are so careless of their personal comfort, and so intent upon accumulating as much money as they can, that they deny themselves every convenience necessary in a tropical climate. In Sierra Leone, for instance, they live in the town, which is at the sea-shore, instead of on the mountains, where they would enjoy the sea breezes equally as well, and be in a cooler and healthier atmosphere. In support of this view, I will only quote a passage which occurs in a paper read by Mr. Hennessy before the Society of Arts in April, 1873, in which he says: “The mountain district (of Sierra Leone), according to the Registrar-General’s Returns, appears to be as healthy as any part of England, or indeed as Madeira, the climate of which it closely resembles.”\n\nI hope I have clearly shown that the large mortality on the West Coast of Africa is not entirely due to climatic influences, and that a great deal could be done by the Government and the Europeans to counteract and mitigate those influences. As living proofs of what I have stated, I beg to point out Mr. Magnus Smith, Mr. A. Montagu, Mr. Marston, and half-a-dozen others, who have resided in Sierra Leone for fifteen or twenty years without meeting with the same fate as their countrymen, and simply because they have known how to live.—I am, dear Sir,', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The frightful condition in which the slaves are landed from the captured slavers at Sierra Leone is vividly depicted:—\n\n""At the period I took charge of the Kissy Hospitals (1837) the slave-trade was in active operation, consequently great numbers of liberated Africans were constantly received into hospital. It was a most distressing sight to witness the arrival of these poor creatures; and it is necessary to make a few preliminary remarks in order clearly to understand the difficulties with which the medical officers had to contend. The appearance of the slaves when landed was most striking. In some the expression of the countenance indicated sufferings, moral and physical, of the most profound and agonising nature. Others of them gazed vacantly around them in the most utter helplessness. Occasionally, among the newly-arrived groups all sense of suffering was merged in melancholic or raving madness. The wizened, shrunk, and skinny features were lighted up by the hollow, feverish eye. The belly was, as it were, tacked to the back, whilst the hip-bones protruded, and, in some cases, became the seat of foul, sloughing ulcers. The hand and skinny fingers seemed much elongated by the great and neglected growth of the nails, and they were so deplorably emaciated, that the skin appeared tensely stretched over, and tied down to the skeleton. The legs refused to perform their functions, and they reeled and tottered about from sheer debility. Their squalor and extreme wretchedness was heightened, in many cases, by the particoloured evacuations with which their bodies were besmeared. When large numbers of the sick were suffering from dysentery, the condition of the wards and yards in the morning was extremely loathsome. This was in a great degree unavoidable, as the sick were too weak to crawl from their mats to the commode, although everything was done under the surgeons\' orders to keep the wards as clean and wholesome as the crowded state of the hospital would admit of."" In a word, ""the moral and physical causes of depression were often so overwhelming, and so intensely concentrated, that the combination produced disease in such formidable shapes as to be beyond remedy. The mortality was consequently very great; many persons brought to the hospital in the last stage of disease died a few hours after their arrival; others even expired by the way. A large proportion died within a few days; and as the names of all these persons were recorded in the hospital books, the percentage of deaths was thereby largely increased.""\n\n*(To be continued.)*', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MISSIONARY VICTIMS TO AFRICAN CLIMATE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The list of missionary victims to the climate in Africa will, we fear, be largely increased in the Eastern and Lake countries.

This last gave as his opinion, ""that a few thousands spent at Cameroons or Fernando Po would, calculating only the market value of seamen\'s lives, repay themselves in as many years."" But the pros and cons of that lofty range as a sanitarium must be considered, and officers on the Coast should be consulted before the Home Government attempt to spend a large amount on it. There are many advantages in its favour, as may be seen described in the work of Captain Burton, on ""Abeokuta and the Cameroons,"" but there are also some great disadvantages attaching to it as a military sanitarium.\n\nIts distance from the different military stations on the Coast is one great objection, as it is situated about 400 miles below the last—viz., Lagos. It will be no great consolation for a sick officer—laid up, perhaps, with intractable fever, debility, diarrhœa, or dysentery, to be ordered, say, from the Gambia or Sierra Leone, to the Cameroons Mountains, a distance of about 2,000 miles, in a steam-packet, which is most uncomfortable, and unadapted for the conveyance of the sick during a voyage of eighteen days, in a direction quite opposite to the accustomed route—viz., to Teneriffe, Madeira, or England. The result would be found invariably to be that most of the cases, and certainly all the serious dysenteric cases, would succumb before the patient could reach the mountain of good hope. As a naval sanitarium it would be excellent, as it is in the neighbourhood of the rendezvous of the West African squadron, extending from the Volta to the Island of Ascension; and of the great oil rivers, to which so many English merchant vessels resort. Those on the Sierra Leone station should, however, have the advantage of the sanitarium about to be proposed.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'So much has been said and written about the climate of West Africa, and it has been so long the fashion to abuse and condemn it without inquiry, that the medical profession, like the general public, have accepted and endorsed the common report as an established fact. It is therefore important to find such mischievous exaggerations combated by a medical officer, who writes of West Africa, not from hearsay evidence, but from the experience derived during a residence of twenty-three years in the colony of Sierra Leone and settlements of the Gold Coast. We make these remarks by way of introducing to more general notice the papers above noted, because they supply much valuable and novel information, not only regarding the diseases to which Europeans and natives are subject in West Africa, but because they furnish an interesting description of the topography of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.\n\nMr. Clarke is of opinion that the climate of West Africa, if fairly tested, can stand comparison in point of healthfulness with most of our colonies in the East or West Indies, where endemic and epidemic fevers, dysentery, with cholera to boot, prevail quite as frequently and fatally. There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years. Comparatively, their number is not small, comprehending persons of all classes—governors, civil and military officers, merchants, and missionaries, with their wives and families. He states ""that formerly many officers in the English, Dutch, and Danish service resided upon the Gold Coast, some fourteen, twenty, and thirty years,* and enjoyed good health, although those in subordinate positions had to remove from one station to another."" The fact ought no longer to be concealed, that half at least of the deaths and incapacities which occur amongst Europeans arise from errors of personal economy, and that the mortality lists are unfairly swelled by ascribing to the climate deaths which have been caused by accident or intemperance.\n\nThe following passages may be adduced as proof that the climate is not to blame for everything:—', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.742, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE AFRICAN CLIMATE', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Since that time Fernando Po has changed its deadly nature, as the coming chocolate and coffee planters will find.

Nor do you make any distinction between the colonies, classing Sierra Leone with Lagos, Gambia, and Cape Coast, which I am sure the facts would not warrant.\n\nTo revert, however, to the causes of mortality on the West Coast of Africa, I am of opinion that there are many influential causes conducing to the same which might be prevented, and I take the liberty of intruding on your valuable space to enumerate one or two of them.\n\n1. The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics. In Brazil, no doubt, some Europeans drink themselves to death, but they are few; the majority, being of a better class, prefer to live well and to enjoy themselves rationally, without making beasts of themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.698, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE CLIMATE OF THE GOLD COAST', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following is taken from an article from the pen of Dr. J. A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2. Avoid getting chilled by standing or sitting for any length of time when the body is unduly heated, or by neglecting to change underclothing as soon as possible after profuse sweating.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1887#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—A very large holder of shares in the West African Gold Mines has called my attention to a paragraph which appeared in the Daily News of March 17th, in which a correspondent of that journal ""earnestly expresses a hope that those who are offered shares in Gold Coast Mines will inform themselves of the deadly nature of the climate for Europeans,"" and also asserts that ""a white man cannot live there and work; the natives cannot be induced to work: as soon as a road is made the jungle grows over it again; the air is poisonous; and the people are debased beyond conception.""\n\nHaving first landed on the West Coast of Africa exactly thirty-one years ago, since which time I have spent less than six years in Europe, the remainder of the period being passed on the Coast, the Gold Coast Colony included, and, moreover, having returned from a visit of six months to the Gold Mines so recently as the end of July last, I trust that you will kindly permit me to contradict, in the most unqualified manner, all the statements of the unknown correspondent of the Daily News.\n\nThe mere fact that I have passed more than half my life in Western Equatorial Africa, including one continued residence there of ten, and another of five years, and am now in good health, and that I can name many Europeans and Americans who have spent as many, if not more, years there, is in itself a sufficient refutation of the supposed (and quite illusory) ""deadly nature of the climate for Europeans,"" when they are not constitutionally unfitted for residence in tropical regions, and will take proper care of themselves, and listen to the advice of ""old Coasters.""

Between 1857 and 1862 I loaded no less than sixteen vessels, and did not lose a single man belonging to any one of them; I treated their crews for fever, dysentery, &c., myself, only calling in medical aid on one or two occasions.

With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CLIMATE OF WESTERN AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I am not singular in believing that healthy Europeans coming to Africa to reside may do so with comparative safety, if they will only take proper precautions to preserve their health.
