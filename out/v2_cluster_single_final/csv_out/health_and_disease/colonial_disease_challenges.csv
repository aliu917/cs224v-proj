The General History of Africa textbook highlights yellow fever as a major epidemic disease in the region, alongside smallpox and sleeping sickness, with epidemics occurring unpredictably from Senegal to Sudan. It notes that while a vaccine was developed by 1927, large-scale use only began during the Second World War, indicating the challenges posed by inadequate medical treatments. Until then, disease control relied primarily on mosquito suppression and netting, reflecting limited infrastructure and medical interventions. The text also discusses high death rates among European officials in the Gold Coast, which were only reduced through improved sanitary measures and treatments. Similarly, The African Times articles provide substantial evidence of yellow fever's prevalence and devastating impact, citing outbreaks in locations like Bathurst, Sierra Leone, and Senegal. They emphasize the lack of proper sanitary measures and high mortality rates among Europeans, while also advocating for improved sanitary conditions and medical interventions, such as Lamplough's Pyretic Saline. The articles further highlight smallpox outbreaks, underscoring the broader public health challenges. Additionally, they offer a nuanced perspective, suggesting that personal behavior and inadequate medical practices, alongside environmental and infrastructural factors, significantly contributed to the health crises. Together, these sources illustrate the multifaceted public health challenges posed by yellow fever in West African colonies during the colonial period.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that support the claim regarding the prevalence and impact of yellow fever in West African colonies during the colonial period.

To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease. Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively. Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s. Nevertheless, tropical medical schools were established in Europe as early as 1897 in Liverpool and London, 1900 in Hamburg, 1901 in Brussels, followed later by Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles, and in Africa by 1912 in Cape Town and 1918 in Dakar."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.789, 'probability_score': 0.055, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""In tropical Africa governmental medicine was long a military concern although small civilian hospitals began to appear in the 1890s. From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered. Yellow fever epidemics have occurred from Senegal to Sudan at unpredictable intervals. By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

The first important beneficial social effect was the overall increase of the population of Africa during the colonial period by about 37.5%, as J. C. Caldwell has shown (Chapter 18), after its decline during the first two or three decades of colonialism. This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization. As A. E. Afigbo has emphasized (Chapter 19), urban› ization was of course not unknown in pre-colonial Africa. The kingdoms and empires of Africa had such capitals or political centres as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, Gao and Great Zimbabwe; such commercial centres as Kano, Jenne, Sofala and Malindi, and such educational centres as Timbuktu, Cairo and Fez. But there is no doubt that as a result of colonial› ism, the pace of urbanization was greatly accelerated. Completely new towns such as Abidjan in Ivory Coast, Takoradi in the Gold Coast, Port Harcourt and Enugu in Nigeria, Nairobi in Kenya, Salisbury (now Harare) in Southern Rhodesia, Lusaka in Northern Rhodesia and Luluabourg in the Kasai Province of the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) came into existence.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.74, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy of the former French, Belgian and Portuguese zones, 1914-35', 'section_title': ""The workers' burden > The crises and their repercussions > Food shortage, famine and epidemic"", 'content': ""Taken all round, however, the catastrophe was less spectacular. The famines were checked thanks to progress in transport facilities and the epidemics were halted by the first health campaign. But the fall in prices and loss of employment were everywhere cruelly felt. 'It was in the price paid to the producer that the decline made itself most heavily felt. The purchasing power of the natives was reduced to a greater extent than in any of the earlier crises.' 48 It is revealing that, in Francophone Africa, large-scale urban immigration began precisely when the great crisis occurred. Notwithstanding the overall stagnation in population growth (in AOF 14.4 million inhabitants in 1931, as compared with 14.6 million in 1936), the towns and cities began to be swollen by the massive influx of destitute peasants, in spite of the fact that the urban employment situation was also critical. In 1936, for example, there were still no more than 167000 wage-earners in AOF, which was hardly more than 1% of the population. Nevertheless, between 1931 and 1936 the populations of Dakar and Abidjan increased by 71%, while that of Conakry doubled. Even more revealing is the case of an impoverished little town in the interior like Ouagadougou which, reversing its previous trend, increased its population by one-third over the same period. The overall stagnation in population growth during this period is parti› cularly indicative of the prevailing state of poverty. For social expenditure, was, by contrast, tending everywhere to rise: the parallel increase in ex› penditure on health care, and in the number of dispensaries and treatment facilities tended effectively to curb the traditional scourges (trypanoso› miasis, venereal diseases, leprosy). By contrast, populations proved to be particularly vulnerable during the taxing period 1931-6 to epidemics ('sporadic illnesses': influenza, smallpox, etc.). It is extremely tempting to relate such increased morbidity to the state of profound distress and physical destitution in which a weakened and defenceless population found itself. 49"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Furthermore, though colonialism did introduce some social services as has been pointed out already, it must be emphasized that not only were these services grossly inadequate and unevenly distributed in each colony, but they were all by and large meant primarily for the benefit of the few white settlers and administrators, hence their concentration in the towns. Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi. It was not until after the Second World War that technical schools and univer› sity colleges were established in most parts of Africa. And significantly, only one university college each was established in the Gold Coast in 1947, in Nigeria in 1948, in Uganda in 1950, in Senegal and Madagascar in 1950, in Salisbury in 1953, in Congo Leopoldville in 1954 and Elizabethville in 1956.

At the beginning of the period the continent's population was still sparse, at least by the standards of the Old World. More signifi› cantly it probably was not growing rapidly and evidenced a vulnerability to the kind of pressures, both internal and external, which were being increasingly applied. By about 1935, the population was undoubtedly grow› ing because of increasing control over mortality, and the basis was laid for a doubling over the next third of a century which almost certainly hastened and consolidated independence.\nMany indices can be used to illustrate the changes between the two dates, and some help to explain the demographic transition. In 1880 a European presence inland from the coast was largely restricted to Algeria, where a third of a million migrants, mainly from France, Spain, Italy and Malta, had consolidated the victory of the French army, and South Africa, where a similar number of Europeans, predominantly of Dutch and English extraction, now had a vanguard as far north as the Limpopo river. (See Fig. i.i.) Elsewhere Europeans were beginning to exert control over Egypt and Tunisia, ruled some coastal populations in Senegal and the Gold Coast (now Ghana) and held such enclaves as The Gambia, Sierra Leone, Lagos, Libreville and parts of Angola and Mozambique. By 1935 European administations controlled almost the entire continent (see Fig. 12.2). The half century saw European medical science progressing from an ignorance of the cause of most of Africa's major diseases to an ability to contain or cure most of them; indeed the period ends just as the sulpha drugs were ushering in an era of chemotherapy of great significance for the continent.

The labourers were often shifted to areas which exposed them to new diseases; but in addition Africans apparently immune to malaria in their home areas developed not only virulent malaria in distant areas but even blackwater fever.$^{61}$ Some of the migrant labourers did not observe the careful sanitary arrangements which exist widely in Africa, especially defecation in areas outside the village and away from streams$^{62}$ thereby polluting their water supplies and spreading dysentery and the newly introduced diseases of typhoid and paratyphoid fever. Certainly the conditions of the work camps encouraged the spread of venereal disease and diarrhoea. The workers, carrying within themselves the great load of worms and agents of diseases commonly found in tropical Africa, worked more strenuously at times than they had learnt was possible for them, and came down with sickness.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths. From 50 to 80 per cent have or have had syphilis or yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm,"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': 'until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

Smallpox vaccination was on such a small scale that by the late 1930s a significant reduction of the disease had probably taken place only in the Gold Coast and southern Nigeria. 93 In contrast, contact with Europeans and participation in the First World War ensured that the influenza epidemic of 1918-19 swept through Africa probably resulting in the highest annual death rate this century, although the rise in death rates was probably not as great as in Asia, for many African populations were still protected by comparative isolation. Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.719, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A fragile population emerging from near stability', 'content': 'This picture is not in any way surprising.

Given the mortality levels described above (which is a conservative assumption in view of the fact that the health conditions of the forests of the west coast equatorial area have probably long been worse than elsewhere), the conclu› sion could be drawn that in the centuries past those areas averaging 5 births per woman had experienced population declines averaging over 0.5 per cent per annum, and those averaging 3.5 children declines of over 1.5 per cent per annum.

Without doubt the upsetting of stable populations, leading in the Congo Free State and elsewhere in Middle Africa to an upsurge in the death rate, the slow reduction in mortality in other parts of the continent during the nineteenth century and generally in this century, and the accelerating nucleation of population in towns and on mining fields owed nearly everything to the industrial revolution and to increasing contact with people from industrial societies. Much of this process would have occurred even without colonial rule: the traders would have provoked trading centres into growth; European medical schools would have become interested in the problem of protecting the traders and others from tropical disease; missionaries would have laid the foundations of a hospital system.\nNevertheless, direct colonial rule certainly speeded up all these processes. Eventually, and certainly towards the end of our period, it helped to reduce the great peaks of mortality by increasingly and effectively importing and utilizing epidemic control technology and creating a modern transport system which could distribute food in areas of famine. The need for administrative centres provided a nucleus for new towns, and colonial administrations' guarantees of personal safety and investment security to the nationals of their metropolitan countries hastened the growth of com› mercial settlements, mining camps and plantations. Without colonial administrations European entrepreneurs might well have been even more rapacious and murderous than they were. Europeans usually justified the colonial penetration by pointing to these achievements. Yet the history of Latin America and China shows that in time most of these gains would have been achieved in any case; the growth of industrialization was irreversible and a modus vivendi with Africa and other developing areas, from which needed raw materials were secured, was essential."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.048, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'Much the same doubts could be cast on another of the trade goods, guns. It was firearms that made it possible for a relatively small number of people to control a greater number of slaves, as Arab and Ethiopian experience in East Africa demonstrated. In the longer run, those areas most advanced in commercialization first developed a commercial, admini› strative and civil infrastructure: port facilities, roads, trading premises, cash cropping and eventually schools and health facilities and possibly declining mortality levels. In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well. In the 1840s the impact of such measures in Algiers was particularly great as the French strove to control cholera. 47', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'These were the major forces determining population change but there were undoubtedly others. Commerce was one, although whether such activities brought prosperity and the ability to buy food in times of need and perhaps some health care in the few places where it existed to a greater degree than it brought disease arising from increased contact with strangers is debatable. By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent. There were two reasons for the trade: firstly that alcohol could be produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits; secondly, in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, there were real problems about what goods would be accepted in return for the produce of Africa.$^{43}$ Mary Kingsley found the trade spirit pure and likely to do less harm than cannabis,$^{44}$ a view shared by a committee that investigated the liquor trade in içoç.$^{45}$ Spirits were distributed on a huge scale, frequently as wages.

Profits depended on moving goods and this meant human porterage in most of tropical Africa, for the tsetse fly often prevented the use of draught animals and the lack of roads or railways prevented powered and wheeled vehicles being used. In Middle Africa the most profitable produce was at first ivory which entailed huge quantities of labour for carrying tusks. With the development of the pneumatic bicycle tyre in the late 1880s and the pneumatic car tyre in the 1890s a huge demand for rubber was created, which could not be met for a generation by plantation rubber (the first Malayan plantation came into production in 1910).

This was partly due to the establishment of an economic base which is evidenced by many developments discussed in several of the chapters above.

Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces.

Since yellow fever plays, in our African West Coast settlements, among Europeans, the part that cholera (unknown in Africa) plays among Europeans in India, and the African is totally exempt from attacks of yellow fever, there can, we should say, be no doubt as to the advisability of qualifying the African and employing him there.'}, {'id': 387, 'article_title': 'THE AFRICAN CLIMATE', 'full_section_title': 'THE AFRICAN CLIMATE', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1864#article-25', 'issue_date': '23_06_1864', 'content': 'Sir,—I venture to hope that in the cause of suffering humanity you will find space for these lines, though forwarded at so full a season.\n\nWhen I landed at Fernando Po, in September, 1860, Santa Isabel, the harbour town, was the only settlement of the new Spanish colony. Pallid men were to be seen sitting languid in their verandahs, or occasionally crawling about the grassy streets, each with a cigarette hanging to the lower lip. My lodgings being unpleasantly near a military hospital, the breakfast-table was frequently enlivened by the spectacle of something covered with a blanket being carried in, and something within a deal box being carried out on four men\'s shoulders. The Europeans died persistently in the dry season from November to April. After three years\' service, out of 155 picked young linesmen, only 47 returned to Spain, the rest being either invalided or having fallen victims to the climate. The rains witnessed the destruction of the negro liberados and the ex-English colonists. At length, in March, 1862, yellow fever, the gift of the Grand Bonny River, fell upon us, and in two months swept off 78 out of a grand total of 250 whites.\n\nAlready the Fathers of the Jesuit mission had built an outstation at Banapa, a native village about two direct miles from the harbour, and 500 feet above the sea level. During the last three years the principal, S. Padre Campillo, has kept his health, and he may still be seen working in his garden as alert and vigorous as though he had never left the natale solum. The example of the Fathers was presently followed by my friend Major Noeli y White. In 1862, when Her Majesty\'s ship Griffin, Commander Perry, touched at this island, two of her officers, young and powerful men, were prostrated by coast fever; they were carried up in hammocks to Major Noeli\'s lumber cottages at Banapa, and in less than a week they walked down the hill convalescents. As Banapa abounds in sandflies and wants level ground, D. Pellon, an employé of the Woods and Forests, preferred a higher site, where he also built for himself a bungalow of boarding at a place which he justly called ""Buena Vista.""\n\nSeeing that the yellow fever did not abate at Santa Isabel, his Excellency Governor de la Gandara resolved to beat it by altitude. In June, 1862, he ran up a timber house, and transported to his temporary hospital nineteen patients, of whom half would certainly have died in the lowlands. Of these men only two were lost. Encouraged by the success of his predecessor, the present governor, his Excellency Senor Brigadier D. Pantaleon Lopez de Ayllon, thought Santa Cecilia (such is the name of the charming spot) worthy of a Maison Caserne, containing quarters for the men on the ground-floor, rooms for himself and five officers on the first story, and a chapel in the loft.

Seven deaths, in the course we believe of three or four days, out of a European population of at most some thirty or forty! There is this fever peculiarity on the West Coast of Africa, that whenever the common fevers are very virulent among the natives, yellow fever attacks Europeans. And this type of disease seems unhappily to have lost none of its fatal power in that part of the world. The _Times_ has lately indulged in a furious sanitary leader against the West Coast, and inserted numerous letters _apropos_ of the mortality by yellow fever on board Her Majesty’s ship Bristol.* A great amount of nonsense has in this case been mixed up with the unhappy truth of nearly thirty deaths in the course of a few months among the officers and crew of that ill-fated vessel. If the loud denouncers of service on the African Coast, because of these deaths, had consulted the statistics of the Navy for some years past, they would have found that the mortality has been by no means the greatest on the West Coast of Africa—that there are other naval stations on which the death-rate is higher. We do not, however, hear it proposed that those stations should therefore be given up; it is only as regards the West Coast of Africa that such abandonment of national duty is urged. It is unhappily fashionable at the present time to attack Africa and the Africans. A leading article of the _Daily Telegraph_, on occasion of the bestowal of a knighthood on Sir Edward Baker, lately returned from the sources of the Nile, might be adduced as additional evidence of this fact. We do not deny the stated disgusting and horrible barbarism and cruel superstition of the mass of the native Africans, whether on the coast or in the interior; we do not deny that there are diseases prevalent there which make the countries so dangerous to Europeans as to exact from them, if they have any regard for their lives, extreme care and prudence, and recourse to the best means of prevention and cure. But we do say that the deeper, the more intense, the more disgusting and horrifying the barbarism and superstition may be, the greater the duty of Christian England to endeavour by the diffusion of Christian truth to mitigate those horrors; and we do also affirm, that the African diseases, including the occasional yellow fever, have not necessarily that fatal character which is attributed to them. The mortality on board the Bristol, if not owing (as in some previously notorious cases) to an abominable source of infection in the ship itself, must have had some recognisable cause or causes. A rigid inquiry seems to us to be necessary, not only as to the original outbreak of the fever among the crew, but as to the means of prevention and cure adopted. If we are not misinformed, it would be found that the mortality has been chiefly among men who were most injudiciously and improperly exposed to excessive labour under a tropical sun, immediately after their arrival from England, and while yellow fever was known to be about. No such case of mortality as this of the crew of the Bristol ought to remain uninquired into. It is easy to cover fatal and most condemnable errors by a denunciation of climate. We should like, alas! to know what was the course of medical treatment adopted on board the Bristol, and what among those who have died at Bathurst? Yellow fever, like cholera, is one of those malignant forms of disease that do not admit of being trifled with. The old system of treatment of yellow fever was one under which to be attacked was almost to have the death-warrant signed for the unhappy sufferer; and a persistence at the present day in such system gives necessarily pretty similar results. But if under that system so few recoveries take place, why are there not imperative orders from the Admiralty and the Colonial Offices, that in all outbreaks of the yellow fever, the _saline treatment_, recommended by Dr. Stevens, under which almost all yellow fever patients are said to have recovered in the West Indies—why, we say, are there not imperative orders that his system should be tried? These are not the days in which the lives of our officers and sailors and Government _employés_ ought to be allowed to be trifled with. Every discovery of modern science ought to be at their command for their use and service, or science may, so far as they are concerned, shut up shop at once. We insist upon this point.

The American papers give details of the outbreak of yellow fever in the Southern States. Thirty-one deaths occurred in Savannah on the 22nd ult., and there was a panic in the city. Notwithstanding this, the exodus of people was small, as nearly every family had some patient who needed careful nursing and attention. There were over 2,000 persons sick with the fever on the 22nd, and 180 new cases were reported on that day. The fatality was latterly more among the wealthier classes. The destitution was very great, over 8,000 people having applied for relief in one day, and though contributions had poured in from all the other cities and townships of Georgia, the State had been compelled to appeal to the whole country for help.

This was, indeed, a triumph of patient scientific observation and experiment by a man, happily, of more than ordinary talent. So delighted and so thankful was the King of Denmark, that he bestowed upon the man who had thus, under God, been the means of preserving the lives of his subjects, an estate of no inconsiderable value. On his return to England, where he spent the latter portion of his valuable life in ease and comfort, respected and beloved, he confided the preparation of this invaluable saline combination to Mr. Lamplough, under whose careful manipulation it has obtained a wide-spread celebrity. But why was it not in such quantities at Savannah as to have controlled the plague? For the same reason that it has not been found in such quantities in other places where the Yellow Fever has suddenly appeared—for the same reason that it was not found and used sufficiently in Western Africa during the last outbreak, and that will prevent its being found and used there in sufficient quantities when the next one shall occur. Again we ask, why this? And thus we are brought at once face to face with the evils that result from the wide-spread publication of falsehoods. So many remedies are day by day advertised (we never admitted them to our columns), each one of perhaps a hundred of which is said to be infallible for the cure of every possible disease ""that flesh is heir to,"" that a bewildered public knows not where to choose, and thousands upon thousands fall victims who might have been spared to life and family and friends had they been able to distinguish the true from the false. Strongly, however, as we felt this when we read the accounts sent from Savannah, we should not have made any remarks on it in our columns, but that we have now the dread of this fell disease making its visit to the Europeans on the West Coast of Africa, with its usual attendant, the virulent Small-pox among the natives. Feeling as we do, it is our duty to warn all to be prepared. There is a family resemblance between the Small-pox and the Yellow Fever, and the same remedy, Lamplough\'s Pyretic Saline, has been triumphant with both. An account appeared in one of the Liverpool papers last spring of a vessel on which the Yellow Fever broke out at sea. The captain, it is said, had nothing on board that he could administer but Lamplough\'s Pyretic Saline. There were four men down with the Fever; he persevered in giving these the Pyretic Saline, and they all recovered. We believe he administered it at the same time to others as a preventive. There are so many places on the West Coast where medical advice and assistance cannot be obtained, that it is all-important people there should have at hand a proved remedy to which they can immediately resort. Where a competent doctor can be found, there can be little doubt he will treat both Yellow Fever and Small-pox with the Saline if he happen to have any, because its efficacy with both these diseases, as with the analogous Jungle Fever of the East Indies, has now become well known to medical men. We were glad to see, in the late admirable work of Dr. Horton, Surgeon-Major, now stationed at Cape Coast Castle, entitled ""Diseases of Tropical Climates,"" that the Doctor frequently recommends the use of it; and Dr. Horton\'s talent and long experience with tropical diseases entitle him to be regarded as an authority in such matters. We have little more to say. This paper is written under a strong sense of duty. We have now done our duty to our friends on the Coast; it rests with them as to whether they will do the duty they owe to themselves and to those about them. We have stated our apprehensions, and we have not hesitated to take upon us the responsibility of stating our firm conviction that there is an efficacious preventive and remedy to which those who are so situate that they cannot hope to obtain immediate competent medical assistance in case of attack, ought to secure access, by providing themselves with it by anticipation; and we think we scarcely need to state that our only motive in giving this advice is to be found in our anxiety that not one life should be lost that might by any possibility be preserved.'}, {'id': 3640, 'article_title': 'Yellow Fever', 'full_section_title': 'Yellow Fever', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1878#article-2', 'issue_date': '02_09_1878', 'content': 'Intelligence from Senegal announces that yellow fever has broken out there.

We have given quotations from the advices daily received in England. It is not alone in the United States, however, that we hear of its ravages. The French Government having received an official report of its serious outbreak at Senegal, despatched immediately a medical reinforcement of six doctors, with adequate supplies of all kinds, to meet the dread emergency. The ravages committed by this malady during its former visits to the West Coast of Africa, when so large a proportion of the Europeans in some of the settlements fell victims to it; and the fearful outbreak of small-pox, of a peculiarly virulent character, among the natives, which attended it in its progress, were so painfully fresh in our memory, that we lost not a moment in calling the attention of Her Majesty\'s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies to the news received, and the measures adopted by the French Government; and soliciting that additional medical aid, with abundant supplies of vaccine lymph, should be also despatched by Her Majesty\'s Government to the West Coast settlements. We have since received an assurance from the Colonial Office that some immediate measures would be taken. We cannot, however, conceal our deep anxiety as regards that dreaded visitant. When it last made its appearance at Bathurst, it carried off its victims with extreme rapidity; and its subsequent progress southward was of an equally distressing character; while the records in our Journal of the heart-rending scenes witnessed by Dr. Horton when on his vaccination tour through the Anamaboe district, attest how deeply the native population must be interested in the matter. Our fear is, that with the cessation of the rains, the Yellow Fever will travel southward from Senegal, and that ere long we shall have to depore its outbreak at Bathurst and Sierra Leone. We do not wish to spread alarm, but we do wish that the imminence of the peril may impel the Colonial authorities to adopt and enforce without delay all possible sanitary precautions. The accounts we have lately received of flagrant inattention as regards this important matter by the authorities at Bathurst and Sierra Leone, who are supposed to be charged with the responsibility of attending to it, are of a nature to deepen our alarm when we hear of Yellow Fever in the neighbourhood. All ordinary reasoning would have justified us in believing that when Her Majesty\'s Government adopted for Bathurst and Sierra Leone the most unusual, if not unprecedented, course of entrusting the local administration to gentlemen of the Army Medical Department, they had at least done what would insure that due attention would be given to sanitary measures. How are we to account for the result not having justified our belief? It cannot be that there were supreme orders that ""no money should be spent"" on what is so vital not only to the prosperity, but to the continued existence of British settlements on the West Coast; and if it be not owing to this, we say it with all proper respect for authorities appointed by the Queen, it cannot be otherwise accounted for than that these authorities are totally unfitted for the responsible posts entrusted to them. Should the Yellow Fever, and the virulent small-pox, its ordinary accompaniment on the West Coast, visit the settlements, their ravages cannot fail to be aggravated by that neglect of sanitary precautions of which complaint is continually reaching us; and the authorities, who have neglected those precautions, although they may not be made criminally liable, as they will have deserved, will at least incur a moral responsibility which may well overwhelm them, if their long familiarity with human sufferings under various diseases shall not have destroyed all ordinary feelings of humanity within their bosoms. We hope these observations from our pen will reach these authorities before the fearful visitants make their appearance; and that all past neglect will be atoned for by an activity as ardent as their apathy has been torpid. We call on all the authorities down the Coast, from Bathurst to Lagos—on all the masters of trading hulks at Bonny, Benin, New and Old Calabar, and Cameroons, and the heads of all trading stations on the South-west Coast, to commence without delay all possible sanitary measures. The Spanish Governor of Fernando Po would act wisely in taking similar precautions. Should the dreaded malady not spread southward from Senegal—as we fervently hope, but cannot believe will be the case—nothing will have been lost by the activity and expense that may have been made and exhibited. Sanitary measures, if properly conceived and carried into execution, must always be productive of benefit to the general health in the absence of virulent epidemics, as well as being influential in arresting and mitigating the spread and intensity of these when they do make their appearance. Among the blessings of British rule ought most certainly to be included a comparative immunity from epidemical diseases, owing to the adoption and enforcement of sanitary regulations; and it is time that efforts be really made in the British settlements on the West Coast to remove the natural stimulating agents of disease, and by sanitary police regulations put an end to all that filthiness which is represented to us as making the atmosphere of many of the Coast towns repulsively sickening and almost unbearable. Lessons in cleanliness are lessons in civilization; and there can be no reason that we know of why Sierra Leone, Bathurst, Cape Coast, Accra, and Lagos should not be made at least as healthy as Calcutta, Madras, and'}, {'id': 3670, 'article_title': 'The West Coast of Africa', 'full_section_title': 'The West Coast of Africa', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1878#article-10', 'issue_date': '02_12_1878', 'content': ""From Ashantee it was reported that the King was having considerable trouble with the various tribes, who before the late war were content to pay him tributes, and that dissensions were rife both in the councils and camps of the various chiefs, many of whom were anxious to return to their old allegiance to the Ashanti dynasty.

The cholera (Asiatic or other), which has been causing so many deaths in Damietta, Cairo, and other towns and districts of Egypt, has caused also considerable inquietude throughout Europe, and called anew into being those quarantine laws an exaggerated enforcement of which produces no small amount of individual suffering, without corresponding general advantage. While the cholera (Asiatic or other) is making its ravages in Egypt, and creating a panic in Mediterranean countries, the old enemy of the tropics, the yellow fever, has been equally fatal at Vera Cruz, and other portions of the coast, in the Gulf of Mexico; and we cannot forget that on former occasions, when this dreaded malady has been thus prevalent on the Mexican Gulf shores, it has also made its destructive visit to some of the countries of the West Coast of Africa. Whether this has been through contagion by contact, or through analogous conditions of climate, seems to be uncertain. But be it which it may, the fact of the epidemic being in vigour at Vera Cruz draws our thoughts at once to Bathurst and Sierra Leone, in the former of which places the state of the drains, burial-grounds, &c., is such as to offer special invitation to yellow fever, or any other destructive malady. It is not in our power, nor within our province, to put an end to such atrocious and suicidal neglect, which has been so often exposed and animadverted upon in our columns; but we feel we should be wanting in our duty if we did not anew remind our readers of the peculiar and wonderful efficacy of **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC SALINE.** It is now some twenty years since, at the instance of General (then Colonel) Hill, who vouched for its wonderful efficacy and preservative powers, as [experienced by himself during his residence in West Africa as Governor at Sierra Leone, the West Coast, through our columns, became acquainted with it, and its merits were widely acknowledged. The **African Times** was then the only journal of and for the West Coast, and it refused to advertise any other medicine; and even **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC SALINE** was not advertised without full inquiry into its merits beyond the experience of Governor Hill. Nothing could be more satisfactory than the facts elicited in that inquiry. Its discovery was owing to researches and experiments made by Dr. Stevens in the Danish West India Island of St. Thomas. There had been most severe epidemics of yellow fever in the island; the mortality was something like seventy out of every hundred attacked. Dr. Stevens, not satisfied with the medical treatment under which the number of fatal cases was so appalling, entered upon a scientific study of the disease. He found, on examination, that in the blood taken from yellow fever patients whose attacks proved fatal, there were no globules; that the effect of the disease was to break down the globules in the blood, converting it into a thick fluid, no longer capable of sustaining life. He subjected this blood to a series of experiments, and at last succeeded by a combination of salts, &c., in reproducing globules in that blood. On this he based his treatment, and reduced the mortality during the next visit of the epidemic to less than 5 per cent. In recognition of services so eminent, His Majesty the King of Denmark bestowed on him a considerable estate, which he enjoyed until two or three years since, when he died of very advanced age at Cheltenham. **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC SALINE** is the combination with which Dr. Stevens cured his yellow fever patients, and with which also he treated some 250 cholera patients in Coldbath-fields Prison, London, during the Asiatic cholera epidemic of 1866. **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC SALINE** is, therefore, not a mere agreeable effervescing aperient, as are, without exception, we believe, the numerous effervescing salines which have sprung into existence as imitations, being for the most part only carbonate of soda, Epsom salts, and tartaric acid, which latter, being prepared from ""argols,"" or the crystals deposited in wine vats, may, indeed, with propriety, be termed a fruit salt, but which as such has no property beyond that of impelling the carbonate of soda to effervescence. We have thought it right at this time, when yellow fever may be threatening the West Coast of Africa, and cholera be threatening England, to remind our readers of the essential difference between **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC SALINE** and the host of effervescing imitations which have more or less succeeded in profiting by its fame, and thus getting into consumption. **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC—DR. STEVENS\' COMPOUND**—exercises a direct and decided regenerating and revivifying action on the blood beyond the indirect action of the other aperient salines; and as we have done from time to time during the past twenty years, so again we recommend it to the daily use of our readers, whether on the West Coast of Africa or in England.'}]","[{'document_title': 'THE OUTBREAK OF YELLOW FEVER.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Bombay, which had at one time as bad a reputation as any town on the West Coast of Africa.

I had heard and read so much of its unhealthiness that I had pictured to myself a low-lying swampy coast, fringed with mangrove bushes, and with the other accompaniments of a malarial climate. This imaginary sketch bore not the slightest resemblance to the truth. In the place of a flat, low-lying district I found a mountainous tract of country, formed by two rivers which nearly intersect it. The general appearance of this Sierra is picturesque in the extreme. The sky line is broken by the irregular outline of a number of conical peaks, covered to their summits with lofty forests, which give to the distant scenery a rich and romantic appearance. Freetown is situated on the shore of a beautiful bay, hemmed in by a grand amphitheatre of hills, covered with vegetation. The distance between the town and the base of the mountains varies from three-quarters of a mile to a mile and a half, the intervening space being broken by numerous grass-clad undulations.\n\nHills ascend almost in regular gradation until they reach the highest peak, and as they are well wooded, the *coup d'œil* is striking and beautiful. A fairer situation for a town can scarcely be imagined, and if the sad experience of the past did not teach us the contrary, it would be pronounced healthy. There is no room to doubt, however, that Sierra Leone is extremely unhealthy, and epidemics of fever occur from time to time which sweep off large numbers of the population. This fever is peculiarly deadly to Europeans, and at the time when there was a European garrison the mortality was immense, whole families being occasionally carried off during one visitation. Happily, few Europeans are now sent to this deadly climate, and the number is yearly decreasing. At the census of 1881 there were only 160 resident whites in the whole of Sierra Leone.

Yes, here is new evidence of the fact, that the denunciations hurled by the families of victims, and by journalists ignorant in these matters, upon the climate of certain portions of the globe under British rule or power, in which British soldiers, sailors, and civilians have to serve, ought rather to be heaped on the authorities who so unnecessarily and wantonly sacrifice the lives of their fellow-subjects and fellow-servants.

This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it.

The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence.

The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics.

249,"Insect plagues, particularly locust and grasshopper infestations, have historically posed significant challenges to agricultural societies in Africa, leading to crop destruction, economic vulnerability, and recurring famines.","The claim that insect plagues, particularly locust and grasshopper infestations, have historically posed significant challenges to agricultural societies in Africa is supported to varying degrees by the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa provides limited direct evidence, mentioning a specific instance of a locust invasion in Niger in 1930 that followed a severe famine, aligning with the claim that such infestations have contributed to agricultural challenges and recurring famines. However, the textbook does not extensively discuss these infestations as a recurring or widespread issue across the continent, nor does it elaborate on their economic impact or frequency. Instead, it emphasizes the effects of colonial policies, forced labor, and the focus on cash crops as primary causes of food shortages and famines, suggesting a different emphasis on the sources of agricultural and economic vulnerabilities. In contrast, The African Times articles offer several details supporting the claim, describing various instances of locust and grasshopper swarms causing widespread crop destruction, leading to economic vulnerability and famine. For example, the Bondei country in East Africa and the Zambesi Industrial Mission in Central Africa are reported to face imminent famine due to locusts consuming essential crops like Indian corn, rice, and native maize. These accounts illustrate the direct impact of insect plagues on agriculture and food security, aligning with the claim. However, the articles also cover unrelated topics such as droughts and earthquakes, indicating that while insect infestations are a significant concern, they are part of a broader context of challenges faced by agricultural societies.","The General History of Africa textbook provides limited direct evidence to support the claim that insect plagues, particularly locust and grasshopper infestations, have historically posed significant challenges to agricultural societies in Africa.

The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

The purchasing power of the natives was reduced to a greater extent than in any of the earlier crises.' 48 It is revealing that, in Francophone Africa, large-scale urban immigration began precisely when the great crisis occurred. Notwithstanding the overall stagnation in population growth (in AOF 14.4 million inhabitants in 1931, as compared with 14.6 million in 1936), the towns and cities began to be swollen by the massive influx of destitute peasants, in spite of the fact that the urban employment situation was also critical. In 1936, for example, there were still no more than 167000 wage-earners in AOF, which was hardly more than 1% of the population. Nevertheless, between 1931 and 1936 the populations of Dakar and Abidjan increased by 71%, while that of Conakry doubled. Even more revealing is the case of an impoverished little town in the interior like Ouagadougou which, reversing its previous trend, increased its population by one-third over the same period.

Millet and sorghum remained the staple crops, being drought-resistant. Royal power was closely linked to the system of production. The king was the 'rainmaker' and also responsible for sharing out the land and organizing river damming and other irrigation works. 13 As a result of such development, we can say that the long-standing disparities in population distribution were probably accentuated in the nineteenth century.

Some economic factors encouraged the practice of gathering, such as the collection of ivory and wax by the Chokwe and this promoted the dispersion of people in the forest.

Last year they made their appearance in Western Kansas early in July, and spread over the western and central portions of the State, making a clean sweep as they passed through. They left a legacy far worse than the original visitation, for they filled the ground full of their eggs, and in the early spring these hatched out in astonishing numbers, with a capacity to eat as they grew that has made a wide region almost as naked (save the trees) as the desert of Sahara.\n\nIn numbers they are simply inconceivable. In places they cover the ground all over, as thick as it is possible for them to be, and at night, as they gather upon fences and trunks of trees, they look\n\n**LIKE BEES ABOUT A HIVE IN SWARMING TIME—**\n\na continuous mass. I attempted to form an estimate of numbers, and went into a beautiful field of wheat, measured a square foot and counted the stalks of wheat growing upon it—found them 42—then I gathered in different places the grasshoppers found on single stalks of wheat, and counted them. I found that a fair average would not be less than five grasshoppers to every stalk of wheat in the field. For convenient reckoning, say 40 stalks to the foot, and five grasshoppers to a stalk, 40 x 5 = 200 grasshoppers to every square foot in the field. There are 43,560 square feet to an acre, 43,560 x 200 = 8,712,000 grasshoppers to an acre; 640 acres a square mile, 8,712,000 x 640 = 5,575,680,000 grasshoppers to a square mile. This may aid the reader to form some idea of infinite numbers, especially if he will conceive of a region of country about 150 miles wide by 250 to 300 miles in length, as devastated by this scourge.\n\nThe destruction is terrible. The regions most severely injured are Jackson, Cass, and Johnson Counties in Missouri; and Wyandotte, Johnson, Miami, and Linn Counties in Kansas. In all this region the wheat, oats, corn, and indeed all the growing crops, are very nearly annihilated. Worse than that, in some respects, is the destruction of small fruits and growing trees.

The admission of a flock of turkeys soon abated this pest, as the turkey is passionately fond of live snails and grasshoppers, and will gorge itself on first admission, but afterwards fatten on them. One turkey will often have a quart of snail-shells in his craw in a day's feed of an infested field. Grasshoppers and snails commit more silent damage in the Bahamas than is commonly noticed. Vigilance in watching the progress of the new East India castor-oil plant caused their detection, the ravage of the sap making the plant turn a pale green and fade away. For snails feed at night, and early in the morning, during the heat of daylight, encase themselves away to hide beneath the densest leaves, close by the stems. The method of preparing castor-oil here is so well known as hardly to need description—viz., first parching the ripe beans, then beating them in a mortar, rolling the mass in balls, and boiling them in pots of sea-water taken from the sea at new and full moon, at a flowing tide, under the impression that the yield is then greater; the oil being skimmed off as it rises to the surface of the boiling sea-water, then fried down a little in another pot to remove any water dipped up in skimming it, and placed in open vessels to cool and clarify, previous to bottling up for sale or future use.\n\nThis boiling process must be better than cold-pressed castor-oil, because some portion of the raw castor-oil bean is a deadly poison, two or three seeds eaten raw being sufficient to bring on a severe attack of cholera morbus. Many suppose this acid-poison lies in the white skin covering over the soft kernel within the seed-case, or hard shell covering of the bean. One of the most delicious sauces for meats or fish known in the West Indies—Cassareep—is made of the juice of the poison Cassava, seasoned with condiments. The fire neutralizes or transforms the vegetable poison in most cases; Cassava, baked or roasted thoroughly, being healthy food, that when raw, or even half cooked, cannot be eaten with impunity. Castor-oil seed is better sown broadcast, in newly-hoed fields, than planted too deep with a hoe; needs atmospheric influence of sun, rain, and earth to germinate quickly; has been known to remain buried several feet under ground for over twenty years, unimpaired in vigour of germ; and being exhumed to the surface of the soil in digging a cow-well, sprouted and took root in three days, and then throve to well-bearing trees of red variety.""}, {'id': 6476, 'article_title': 'FAMINE IN EAST AFRICA', 'full_section_title': 'FAMINE IN EAST AFRICA', 'last_edit_date': '04-25-1894', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_07_1894#article-17', 'issue_date': '02_07_1894', 'content': 'The Rev.

On the 17th of March last, a most destructive drought, which had continued for many months throughout the Accra districts—I do not here include the entire eastern districts, but the Accra districts only, situated between the rivers Sekenn and Volta—was happily broken up by a fine shower of rain, which was followed by other showers at intervals until the 13th of May. They then ceased until the 16th of June, when a light shower fell. We then had no more rain until the 31st of July, and then only a light shower. There has, in fact, been no proper rainy season in the Accra districts this year, and the consequence has been a failure of all the crops of corn, yams, cassada, ground-nuts, &c., which were growing near the Coast. This will probably occasion a great scarcity of food among the Coast populations about the end of the year.\n\nThis irregularity of seasons is doubtless connected with what may be termed our earthquake atmosphere, which evidently still continues to exist. There have been two very distinct shocks of earthquake here during the past three weeks; the latter shock occurred on Saturday morning last, the 1st inst.\n\nYou are doubtless aware that tropical Africa, or rather I should say torrid Africa, abounds in ants throughout all its forests and cultivated tracts, and that they construct monster ant-hills, rising frequently to ten or twelve feet in height, or even more, and having many of them a singularly castellated aspect. Since the great earthquake in 1862, which was so destructive to the houses in the Accra capital, these millions of ants have almost entirely disappeared from the western parts of the Accra districts—that is, they are not now found as usual on the surface of the ground, and are probably down some way under the surface. They partially appeared during some showers of rain last year, but they are now entirely out of sight; and the traveller may now walk for many miles without seeing one train of ants crossing his path.

Occasionally a strong breeze blows from the south-west, so intensely cold for this climate, that a fire becomes agreeable.\n\nIt is frequently the case that the latter rains commence here towards the end of September, and continue through October; should it so happen this year, it will be a great benefit to the country, and enable the farmers to grow a crop of corn, and other vegetable food; but should the latter rains also fail us as the former have done, there will necessarily follow a great scarcity of food, and much suffering among the people.—Yours sincerely,"", 'last_edit_date': '1866-09-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1866#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.627, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The frightful condition in which the slaves are landed from the captured slavers at Sierra Leone is vividly depicted:—\n\n""At the period I took charge of the Kissy Hospitals (1837) the slave-trade was in active operation, consequently great numbers of liberated Africans were constantly received into hospital. It was a most distressing sight to witness the arrival of these poor creatures; and it is necessary to make a few preliminary remarks in order clearly to understand the difficulties with which the medical officers had to contend. The appearance of the slaves when landed was most striking. In some the expression of the countenance indicated sufferings, moral and physical, of the most profound and agonising nature. Others of them gazed vacantly around them in the most utter helplessness. Occasionally, among the newly-arrived groups all sense of suffering was merged in melancholic or raving madness. The wizened, shrunk, and skinny features were lighted up by the hollow, feverish eye. The belly was, as it were, tacked to the back, whilst the hip-bones protruded, and, in some cases, became the seat of foul, sloughing ulcers. The hand and skinny fingers seemed much elongated by the great and neglected growth of the nails, and they were so deplorably emaciated, that the skin appeared tensely stretched over, and tied down to the skeleton. The legs refused to perform their functions, and they reeled and tottered about from sheer debility. Their squalor and extreme wretchedness was heightened, in many cases, by the particoloured evacuations with which their bodies were besmeared. When large numbers of the sick were suffering from dysentery, the condition of the wards and yards in the morning was extremely loathsome. This was in a great degree unavoidable, as the sick were too weak to crawl from their mats to the commode, although everything was done under the surgeons\' orders to keep the wards as clean and wholesome as the crowded state of the hospital would admit of."" In a word, ""the moral and physical causes of depression were often so overwhelming, and so intensely concentrated, that the combination produced disease in such formidable shapes as to be beyond remedy. The mortality was consequently very great; many persons brought to the hospital in the last stage of disease died a few hours after their arrival; others even expired by the way.

Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease. Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively. Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s. Nevertheless, tropical medical schools were established in Europe as early as 1897 in Liverpool and London, 1900 in Hamburg, 1901 in Brussels, followed later by Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles, and in Africa by 1912 in Cape Town and 1918 in Dakar."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.763, 'probability_score': 0.054, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy of the former French, Belgian and Portuguese zones, 1914-35', 'section_title': ""The workers' burden > The crises and their repercussions > Food shortage, famine and epidemic"", 'content': ""Taken all round, however, the catastrophe was less spectacular. The famines were checked thanks to progress in transport facilities and the epidemics were halted by the first health campaign. But the fall in prices and loss of employment were everywhere cruelly felt. 'It was in the price paid to the producer that the decline made itself most heavily felt. The purchasing power of the natives was reduced to a greater extent than in any of the earlier crises.' 48 It is revealing that, in Francophone Africa, large-scale urban immigration began precisely when the great crisis occurred. Notwithstanding the overall stagnation in population growth (in AOF 14.4 million inhabitants in 1931, as compared with 14.6 million in 1936), the towns and cities began to be swollen by the massive influx of destitute peasants, in spite of the fact that the urban employment situation was also critical. In 1936, for example, there were still no more than 167000 wage-earners in AOF, which was hardly more than 1% of the population. Nevertheless, between 1931 and 1936 the populations of Dakar and Abidjan increased by 71%, while that of Conakry doubled. Even more revealing is the case of an impoverished little town in the interior like Ouagadougou which, reversing its previous trend, increased its population by one-third over the same period. The overall stagnation in population growth during this period is parti› cularly indicative of the prevailing state of poverty. For social expenditure, was, by contrast, tending everywhere to rise: the parallel increase in ex› penditure on health care, and in the number of dispensaries and treatment facilities tended effectively to curb the traditional scourges (trypanoso› miasis, venereal diseases, leprosy). By contrast, populations proved to be particularly vulnerable during the taxing period 1931-6 to epidemics ('sporadic illnesses': influenza, smallpox, etc.). It is extremely tempting to relate such increased morbidity to the state of profound distress and physical destitution in which a weakened and defenceless population found itself. 49"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A fragile population emerging from near stability', 'content': 'This picture is not in any way surprising.

In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans.

Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.739, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""In tropical Africa governmental medicine was long a military concern although small civilian hospitals began to appear in the 1890s. From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered. Yellow fever epidemics have occurred from Senegal to Sudan at unpredictable intervals. By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

It is more difficult, but perhaps not impossible, to imagine that the level of disease (venereal disease and other infections) generated during this period still resulted in a high level of female sterility half a century or more afterwards. It is also difficult to feel that the situation in this region is adequately covered by a recent United Nations' publication writing of'cultural shock' and 'the processes of adjustment'. 71 Eventually the colonial penetration was to lead to a great increase in population. This was partly due to the establishment of an economic base which is evidenced by many developments discussed in several of the chapters above.

At the beginning of the period the continent's population was still sparse, at least by the standards of the Old World. More signifi› cantly it probably was not growing rapidly and evidenced a vulnerability to the kind of pressures, both internal and external, which were being increasingly applied. By about 1935, the population was undoubtedly grow› ing because of increasing control over mortality, and the basis was laid for a doubling over the next third of a century which almost certainly hastened and consolidated independence.\nMany indices can be used to illustrate the changes between the two dates, and some help to explain the demographic transition. In 1880 a European presence inland from the coast was largely restricted to Algeria, where a third of a million migrants, mainly from France, Spain, Italy and Malta, had consolidated the victory of the French army, and South Africa, where a similar number of Europeans, predominantly of Dutch and English extraction, now had a vanguard as far north as the Limpopo river. (See Fig. i.i.)

Commerce was one, although whether such activities brought prosperity and the ability to buy food in times of need and perhaps some health care in the few places where it existed to a greater degree than it brought disease arising from increased contact with strangers is debatable. By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent. There were two reasons for the trade: firstly that alcohol could be produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits; secondly, in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, there were real problems about what goods would be accepted in return for the produce of Africa.$^{43}$ Mary Kingsley found the trade spirit pure and likely to do less harm than cannabis,$^{44}$ a view shared by a committee that investigated the liquor trade in içoç.$^{45}$ Spirits were distributed on a huge scale, frequently as wages.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well.

The first important beneficial social effect was the overall increase of the population of Africa during the colonial period by about 37.5%, as J. C. Caldwell has shown (Chapter 18), after its decline during the first two or three decades of colonialism. This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization. As A. E. Afigbo has emphasized (Chapter 19), urban› ization was of course not unknown in pre-colonial Africa. The kingdoms and empires of Africa had such capitals or political centres as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, Gao and Great Zimbabwe; such commercial centres as Kano, Jenne, Sofala and Malindi, and such educational centres as Timbuktu, Cairo and Fez. But there is no doubt that as a result of colonial› ism, the pace of urbanization was greatly accelerated.

Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

The only doctor in that county is a Dr. Fletcher. Though the ""small-pox"" is so fearful among the people, yet there is no vaccination. The people are dreadfully afraid of the disease; some of the young men went on board the mail-steamer and begged the doctor of the steamer to vaccinate them. The majority of the people do not know what vaccination is, and the effect it produces, consequently they have no faith in it, and will not go to their doctor to be vaccinated. The doctor of the steamer was informed of this. Dr. Fletcher says it is not only ""small-pox,"" but it is both ""small-pox"" and ""black measles;"" some of the people have the ""small-pox,"" and others the ""black measles."" The people told their doctor to his face that he was a liar, that it was not ""black measles,"" but ""small-pox."" They will not listen to his advice, not to drink cold water, but they would drink, saying that he knew nothing about the disease. The people at last so tried their doctor\'s patience, and vexed him so sore, that he advised them to drink as much rum as they liked; so that drunkenness prevails to a fearful extent in the county, the people believing it will prevent them having the disease. The dead have no one to bury them, and none will follow their loved ones to the grave. It is also said the few who had it and recovered try to give it to those who have not had it, saying, that all should have it as they had. One Mr. R. S. M\'Gill, a merchant in that county, built a ""small-pox"" house, and directed the Government to send to it all who have the disease; but very few went, and there was no power to compel the rest to go. This Mr. R. S. M\'Gill, who is said to have been, and is still the main support of that county, and one or two others, have made provisions such as the county could afford for those who went to the ""small-pox"" house. Many of them might have recovered, but died from mere starvation. The mortality is fearful; the number of deaths is not ascertained. It is said that this is the first time the ""small-pox"" ever visited the Liberians at Cape Palmas, though they have had it always amongst the natives; but it never reached them in the\n**[Feb. 28, 1873.]**\n\ncounty till this time.

The small-pox is a deadly disease in every part of the world to which it makes its visit, but has always been especially fatal among intertropical populations. It has been a greater depopulator of West Africa than any other disease known along the West Coast; and we hope that wherever the British authorities possess influence, that influence will be earnestly exerted in inducing the natives to be vaccinated.

The filthy condition of that town, fully exposed in late numbers of this journal, must without doubt tend to the increase of its severity, as well as to the number of attacks. A few years since (six, we believe), after great ravages of smallpox at Accra, when Dr. Gunn, who was at that time on the station, vaccinated a very considerable number of the native population, and thus, it was considered, did much to arrest the onward progress of the fatal disorder, we more than once called attention to the subject, in the hope that the British authorities in the settlements of this country on the Coast, would take some effectual measures for bringing the population gradually under that degree of protection which vaccination undoubtedly affords. We do not say what that degree is; but, looking at the European population in the present day, with their smooth, unmarked faces, we find they present so marked a contrast to those of the generation passed away, as to establish beyond dispute that the degree is a very considerable one. It is, therefore, greatly to be regretted that our self-martyrising, zealous Administrators on the West Coast, while ""wearing themselves to the very verge of the grave"" in their arduous exertions for the good of the native population, have not paid more attention to this important matter of the employment of preventive means for arresting the spread of that terrible scourge of Africa—smallpox—among the native people. In another column we publish a short account of an experience in this matter in the East Indies, where the prejudice against, or rather disbelief in the benefit of vaccination, has far exceeded anything of the kind experienced in Africa. Indeed, Dr. Gunn assured us at the time of the Accra outbreak, the people came willingly and with strong expressions of gratitude to obtain the protection (then proved in their eyes to be real) which vaccination affords. Whether the self-made Martyr Administrator of Cape Coast returns there, or some other aspirant martyr be sent out, we beg once again to express the hope that, by the formation of a vaccine institution, or by giving a fee per head to the Army and Colonial Surgeons for every child or adult properly and effectively vaccinated by them, or by some other active and dependable means, the native population in the future may be less exposed to the ravages of smallpox than it has been in the past. The records of travellers and explorers establish incontestably that smallpox is the great fatal disease of Africa. Among the great and precious benefits which European civilisation bestows on Africa, let this be one, that we make the results of our own experience instrumental in saving African lives from that fell destroyer.

The purchasing power of the natives was reduced to a greater extent than in any of the earlier crises.' 48 It is revealing that, in Francophone Africa, large-scale urban immigration began precisely when the great crisis occurred. Notwithstanding the overall stagnation in population growth (in AOF 14.4 million inhabitants in 1931, as compared with 14.6 million in 1936), the towns and cities began to be swollen by the massive influx of destitute peasants, in spite of the fact that the urban employment situation was also critical.

Nevertheless, between 1931 and 1936 the populations of Dakar and Abidjan increased by 71%, while that of Conakry doubled. Even more revealing is the case of an impoverished little town in the interior like Ouagadougou which, reversing its previous trend, increased its population by one-third over the same period.

The supplies of millet, noncompulsory, depended entirely on the local chiefs. In 1931, the refusal of the administration to lower the head tax, and its insistence on collective payment, which forced the peasants to pay also for deserters and for deceased people, led to a situation in which, as one report put it, 'entire villages vanished ... and an age group was completely decimated'$^{47}$ with, in some areas, a mortality rate of over 50%."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.594, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""However, the development which probably had the earliest impact on the mortality level was the penetration of the roads and railways. By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths. From 50 to 80 per cent have or have had syphilis or yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm,"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.585, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A fragile population emerging from near stability', 'content': 'This picture is not in any way surprising.

Given the mortality levels described above (which is a conservative assumption in view of the fact that the health conditions of the forests of the west coast equatorial area have probably long been worse than elsewhere), the conclu› sion could be drawn that in the centuries past those areas averaging 5 births per woman had experienced population declines averaging over 0.5 per cent per annum, and those averaging 3.5 children declines of over 1.5 per cent per annum.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered. Yellow fever epidemics have occurred from Senegal to Sudan at unpredictable intervals. By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.587, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': ""Famines and psychological stress also left the uprooted and malnourished vulnerable to infectious diseases carried by the coastal traders. Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

It may have remained constant, as the evidence of the age structure recorded over fifty years by the censuses of the Gold Coast and Ghana suggest.

The other is the possibility that the population has not been stationary, but has been averaging a rate of growth of up to 0.5 per cent per annum for several centuries (for reasons which will be discussed below). The full range of possibilities allows us to describe a society where women averaged 5.5-7 live births yielding a birth rate of 42-50 per thousand, and where the expectation of life at birth was 20-30 years yielding a death rate of 38-50 per thousand and an infant mortality rate of 250-375 deaths per thousand live births. A medium assumption might be a situation where women averaged little more than six live births, where population growth averaged 0.33 per cent, where the expectation of life at birth was about 22.5 years (about the level of Rome at the end of the Republic)$^{20}$ and where the crude birth rate was about 48 per thousand, the crude death rate 45 per thousand and the infant mortality rate 300-350 per thousand.

Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.588, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Mfecane and the rise of new African states', 'section_title': 'The country and farming practices of the northern Nguni', 'content': 'These changing conditions in the area of the northern Nguni may have been exacerbated by a severe famine known as Madlathule, whose eruption is estimated to have occurred somewhere between the last decade of the eighteenth and the first decade of the nineteenth century.$^{15}$ Inter alia this terrible famine is said to have been characterized by roving bands of starving people who pounced on food stores.

It is also difficult to feel that the situation in this region is adequately covered by a recent United Nations' publication writing of'cultural shock' and 'the processes of adjustment'. 71 Eventually the colonial penetration was to lead to a great increase in population. This was partly due to the establishment of an economic base which is evidenced by many developments discussed in several of the chapters above. Some of the more spectacular of them were the develop› ment of palm-oil exports from the Niger delta, the discovery of diamonds and then gold in Southern Africa in the years from 1870 to 1900, the development of an indigenous cocoa-growing industry in the Gold Coast in the 1890s and the discovery of huge deposits of copper between the Congo and Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) in the early years of the century."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.56, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Niger delta > The eastern delta', 'content': ""The roots of the social problems in the delta states may be traced to the difficulties the ruling groups faced in changing from an economy based on the slave trade to one based on palm produce. Those settlements established during the slave trade were unaware of the strength of the external forces behind the abolitionist movement, and could not wholly commit themselves to a new and difficult trade commodity. A switch meant changing old trade habits and methods, and dealing with a new set of white traders. Internally too, it was more difficult to process palm oil, and to crack the palm nuts to obtain the kernels than to organize slave supply. For the delta merchants, it meant having to penetrate deeper into the hinterland to the centres of production, and the use of a larger labour force and canoes. It was a situation with the potential for making the old established leaders bankrupt, and encouraging the rise of new enterprising ones. Three major develop› ments flowed from this: first, the new trade led to an increase in the internal slave trade to supply the manpower requirements of the delta states; second, the growth of new Houses and Heads resulted in the disturbance of the internal political balance (Dike's slave revolts) and, third, competition for the hinterland markets led to several wars between the delta states."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.552, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > Summary', 'content': 'However, it should not be forgotten that, behind the disruption and dislocation of external state structures during this period, many peoples, throughout all these upheavals, which sometimes involved tragic move› ments of population, were tenaciously continuing to work and ensure the survival of society.

The most successful were the mais of Borno, the least so were perhaps the ex-sultans of Kano, whilst others merely came to terms with the new regime. In some areas, such as Nupe, the war was not yet over, in other areas, such as Qyo, it had scarcely begun.\nFor the victorious Muslim reformers, reconstruction was complicated by the need to keep precisely to Islamic law. Initially Shaykh \'Uthman had been very strict in his interpretation of what was legal and illegal for a proper Muslim, but after 1810 he gradually altered his position, tolerating practices (such as the use of music) he had earlier condemned.$^{4}$ Nonetheless the concern of all the djihad leaders - Shaykh/Uthmän, his brother \'Abdullah and the Shaykh\'s son Muhammad Bello - was to appoint at all levels of the administration men with both the education to understand Islamic law and the personal authority to implement it. But casualties among scholars and students had been especially high during the war, and even in Sokoto at this time there were not enough learned men to post as local amirs, judges and imams to the rural areas.

Due to a by no means unusual time-lag, European decisions to abolish the slave trade did not prevent it from reaching a paroxysm in the course of the nineteenth century in a number of countries on the Niger Bend and in the upper basin of the various affluents of the Volta. Emancipation by the state and reintegration into lineage groups did little to reduce the destructive effects of this scourge, which was not to abate until the end of the nineteenth century. In fact, those countries whose economies had been kept going by the 'ports of the desert' at the end of the caravan routes were now enclosed and isolated, being separated from the coast by other states, at a time when basic trading patterns were collapsing. In such circumstances they were bound, slowly but inexorably, to fall into decline.\nIn these circumstances, as often happens in periods of crisis, social divisions were exacerbated, transforming the relatively egalitarian struc› tures that had been characteristic of the societies of the Sahel during their period of ascendancy. Another factor was the evolution of the religious movements which, after the tolerance towards traditional cults shown during the preceding centuries, had adopted a more intransigent attitude as a result of the djihad, which had triumphed in Liptako and had swept through the Bambara states. Even the YarsØ of the Mossi country, pre› viously so flexible in both religious and political affairs, began to take up much more rigid positions and engaged in proselytism.

His predecessors have done so little that there is overwhelming work for him to do, unless he be allowed to appoint subordinates whom he can imbue with his own spirit. We would venture to ask his Excellency's consideration of our Quittah letters. They are brief and plain, but to the point, and, we think, well worthy his attention, so soon as his settlement of the Ashanti episode and the important Lagos question referred to in our last will permit. Our support may not be of much importance, but, such as it is, it will be heartily given to him in every effort to make British rule a mighty civilizing agent and a real blessing to the Gold Coast countries and their people."", 'last_edit_date': '1881-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1881#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE FEVER AT BATHURST', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Weeping and mourning are at the Gambia; desolation and woe have fallen upon the unhappy town of Bathurst. A pestilential fever, against the threatened approaches of which no efforts at prevention were made by ignorant, incapable, and criminally erring officials, marched up from the foetid swamp, descended into the habitations of rich and poor, European and native; and death, terror, and dismay reigned supreme over all. The graphic letter on our 2nd page tells a little of the fatal tale. The Chief Magistrate, a young man in the full vigour and strength of life, four Europeans, and three natives, fell victims in one day. Well might the poor stricken people believe that this was only the vanguard of the Yellow Fever which had made its ravages at Senegal; and against the probable coming of which we had warned the besotted officials, who were too intent, each on his own little game, to heed our earnest entreaties to set their house in order. A heavy responsibility for the precious lives that have been taken away, should lie at the door of those whose duty it was to take adequate measures for the preservation of the public health. The large surplus which is the present boast of the Gambia Treasury—to create which the public service has in many ways been starved, and for creating which personal promotion is no doubt expected—is now made loathsome by the putrid corpses of victims whose lives have been sacrificed to it. Cynics and profound moralists equally affirm, that at the present time nothing is worshipped but money. The officials of Gambia and Sierra Leone may be adduced in support of the truth of this stigma. We earnestly hope the results will not be as fatal in the latter place as in the former. But when blundering, incapacity, and selfishness had done their worst, a kind Providence stepped in with its healthy Harmattan wind, and the pestilence gradually abated. We hope the influence of that health-giving wind will be felt at other parts of the Coast. Its absence last year was deeply deplored at Lagos, where small-pox and other fatal diseases then prevailed. But although the pestilence has been killed for a time at Bathurst by the Harmattan, we hope the present safety will not renew the guilty official apathy; and that the lives of the inhabitants will be deemed of more value than a few hundreds of pounds, more or less, in the Treasury. We say advisedly, guilty official apathy. Look at paragraphs in a letter from Bathurst in our last month\'s paper, page 2: ""The streets and drains are very dirty, the effluvia from the latter very bad; the native yards in a filthy state; and though we pay local rates of 400l. a year, and there is a surplus now in the Treasury of 6,000l., yet not a penny can or will be spared for sanitary measures, because Mr. Bauer"" (the Colonial Engineer) ""will not act;"" and yet we are face to face with a most sickly season; fever fast approaching to an epidemic in virulence; deaths are rapid and numerous, natives as well as Europeans. Still nothing is done!"" Our correspondent goes on to say that some months ago, ""We sent a petition to the Colonial Secretary, complaining of the inefficiency of the Engineer Department, asked for a Board of Inquiry, and engaged to substantiate all our charges. Dr. Gouldsbury"" (the Administrator, who is a most intimate friend of Mr. Bauer and his family) ""wrote to Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, to the effect that our statements were false; our complaints personal feeling; that Mr. Bauer was a \'most zealous and efficient officer,\' &c. The Colonial Secretary wrote back to us to the effect that, in view of the Governor\'s report, he gave no credence to our statements, and would not grant any inquiry."" In other words, the memorialists of Bathurst had the lie given to them, in the same way that it was also given to those of Sierra Leone; in both cases upon the mere ipse dixit of the erring Governor. Alas! what a commentary on all this is the fearful mortality that has plunged Bathurst into wailing, lamentation, and woe; a mortality distinctly traceable to Engineering and Administrative favouritism and incapacity or heartless indifference. Do not these events furnish a startling proof of the necessity of combined action on the West Coast, that all the settlements and populations, European merchants as well as natives, should have our constant help to bring their wants and just complaints in such a way before Her Majesty\'s Government, that it shall not be in the power of erring officials, however high their grade, to call down Imperial insult on an injured people; and obstruct the course of reforms on which the lives of the inhabitants and the prosperity of the Settlement depend?', 'last_edit_date': '1879-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1879#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Gross Administrative Neglect', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Sir,—Though to-day is the twentieth day since the water broke through the embankment at Half Dic, yet the repairs are not finished.

Any one not accustomed to the contemplation of West Coast enormities would imagine that, putting humanity altogether out of the question, the common instincts of self-preservation would stir up the European officials who are sent out to teach civilisation to the natives to insist upon the adoption and enforcement of those ordinary sanitary regulations which simple decency demands, and which are essential to the preservation of the public health even in temperate, and much more in tropical climates. Yet after forty years and more of British Government authority at Cape Coast, the state of the little town and neighbourhood is such as described. In the presence of so offensive, disgusting, and dangerous a state of affairs, are we not justified in becoming disturbers of official tranquillity? It is no doubt the summum bonum of official life to get as much pay, as many perquisites and indulgences, as much consideration and homage, and do as little work as possible; and it is perhaps an excess of impertinence to criticise the conduct of the favoured mortals sent of course expressly into the world to work out so delicious a destiny. But as a common every-day labourer in the vast field of humanity and progress, we have no sympathy with men who are content to enjoy their mistresses and drink their brandy and champagne upon a dungheap, provided they may occupy the highest position of the stinking mass. For after all, if this description be correct, as we know that it is, what are Government House or any other official abodes in the town of Cape Coast but the most elevated sites on a dangerous and offensive dungheap? The only man in office, so far as we remember, who ever made the slightest move toward doing anything for the purification of the streets and roads of Cape Coast Town was that blundering and arbitrary soldier Governor, Colonel Conran, whose one idea of governing was to bring every individual in the community under the provisions of the Mutiny Act. Our columns teemed years ago, before Colonel Conran\'s time, with denunciations of the public filth and indecency of Cape Coast Town, and of the British officials in power who made no effort to apply a remedy. And now of course, with the increase of population, things have gone from bad to worse. Shame and disgrace and infamy be upon successive governors and administrators, colonial surgeons and principal medical officers, who have attended only to their own selfish aims and enjoyments in the presence of the ever-augmenting abomination. We write with warmth; we have lately lost there a dear and cherished friend, who fell a victim to the pestilential atmosphere, and who, it may be, if governors and administrators had done their duty and made Cape Coast Town what it ought to be as a seat of British authority, might have been spared for yet many years of usefulness in the noble work to which she had dedicated the remainder of her existence. She had, it is true, mental anxieties, and a not over vigorous frame, but it was the pestilential fetor atmosphere of a tropical town full of all stinking abominations that killed her. And there is no excuse. There have now for a long time been abundant funds in the colonial chest—the British Administrator lives in the town—a governor-general goes, or ought to go, there occasionally—there is always one principal medical officer (army surgeon) as well as a colonial surgeon—there is (it is now some nine months or more since he was sent out) a Government civil engineer—and yet it seems that nothing effective has been attempted, and Cape Coast Town and its adjacent roads are one vast public privy and dunghill, upon which, as the Editor of the West African Herald justly observes, a general annihilating pestilence may, and most likely will, suddenly swoop down to carry off its thousands of victims. People who do not know what may be done by officials on the West Coast of Africa will perhaps say, ""Oh, things cannot be so bad as that; the Administrator, &c., would certainly take care of himself, and he must incur the same danger there now as others."" This is a great mistake. Let pestilence swoop down, as is but too reasonably anticipated, and the occupant of Government House, as well as other principal officials, would find no difficulty in obtaining leave of absence on urgent medical grounds. We can see no remedy, no efficient remedy, but a change, and a sweeping one, in the whole official system at Cape Coast. With continually augmenting revenues, soon we hope and believe to be doubled or trebled, no sanitary measures are adopted, no roads are planned, much less commenced; men may be flogged in gaol almost to the verge of death, and then sent to shot-drill to close their mouths for ever, and the Colonial-office sits still and looks on with contented self-complacency and admiration, and will, we fear, continue to look on, until the indignant thunderings of an outraged humanity shall make themselves heard from the mouth of some new Brougham amid the plaudits of an electrified House of Commons.

The want of proper sanitary measures is another reason why the climate of West Africa proves fatal to many European constitutions. When streets and yards, both back and front of houses, are made the receptacles of filth and excrement, of putrified remains of dead dogs, cats, and other animal and vegetable matter, is it to be wondered at that the miasma rising from these dung-heaps eventually becomes fatal to those constantly inhaling it. This is a cause which it would be well for the colonial authorities here to take into their serious consideration, as it is most certainly a preventible one. It was only in 1871, during the administration of Mr. J. Pope Hennessy, that the sanitary condition of Freetown seriously occupied the attention of the Government; but whether that gentleman’s plans have ever been efficiently carried out, and what effects they have hitherto had there, we have no means here to ascertain.\n\n3. The Europeans on the West Coast of Africa, unlike their countrymen in India, South America, and elsewhere, perhaps for the reasons I have already stated, are so careless of their personal comfort, and so intent upon accumulating as much money as they can, that they deny themselves every convenience necessary in a tropical climate. In Sierra Leone, for instance, they live in the town, which is at the sea-shore, instead of on the mountains, where they would enjoy the sea breezes equally as well, and be in a cooler and healthier atmosphere. In support of this view, I will only quote a passage which occurs in a paper read by Mr. Hennessy before the Society of Arts in April, 1873, in which he says: “The mountain district (of Sierra Leone), according to the Registrar-General’s Returns, appears to be as healthy as any part of England, or indeed as Madeira, the climate of which it closely resembles.”\n\nI hope I have clearly shown that the large mortality on the West Coast of Africa is not entirely due to climatic influences, and that a great deal could be done by the Government and the Europeans to counteract and mitigate those influences. As living proofs of what I have stated, I beg to point out Mr. Magnus Smith, Mr. A. Montagu, Mr. Marston, and half-a-dozen others, who have resided in Sierra Leone for fifteen or twenty years without meeting with the same fate as their countrymen, and simply because they have known how to live.—I am, dear Sir,', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.607, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Horrible and Dangerous State of Cape Coast after Forty Years of British Rule', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We have already endeavoured to direct the notice of the authorities to the abominable condition of the streets, lanes, and gutters of this town.

If the Government are determined to remain supine in this matter, let them at least provide for the speedy interment of the dead when the expected cholera comes upon us. In the latter part of 1869, when the cholera was expected at Sierra Leone, the Government of that settlement lost no time in making such arrangements as would at any rate lessen the horrors of the possibly impending calamity if it should come. If the streets are to remain as they are, Government ought to employ the convict prisoners in digging pits at proper places outside the town, for the purposes of burial.

We have given quotations from the advices daily received in England. It is not alone in the United States, however, that we hear of its ravages. The French Government having received an official report of its serious outbreak at Senegal, despatched immediately a medical reinforcement of six doctors, with adequate supplies of all kinds, to meet the dread emergency. The ravages committed by this malady during its former visits to the West Coast of Africa, when so large a proportion of the Europeans in some of the settlements fell victims to it; and the fearful outbreak of small-pox, of a peculiarly virulent character, among the natives, which attended it in its progress, were so painfully fresh in our memory, that we lost not a moment in calling the attention of Her Majesty\'s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies to the news received, and the measures adopted by the French Government; and soliciting that additional medical aid, with abundant supplies of vaccine lymph, should be also despatched by Her Majesty\'s Government to the West Coast settlements. We have since received an assurance from the Colonial Office that some immediate measures would be taken. We cannot, however, conceal our deep anxiety as regards that dreaded visitant. When it last made its appearance at Bathurst, it carried off its victims with extreme rapidity; and its subsequent progress southward was of an equally distressing character; while the records in our Journal of the heart-rending scenes witnessed by Dr. Horton when on his vaccination tour through the Anamaboe district, attest how deeply the native population must be interested in the matter. Our fear is, that with the cessation of the rains, the Yellow Fever will travel southward from Senegal, and that ere long we shall have to depore its outbreak at Bathurst and Sierra Leone. We do not wish to spread alarm, but we do wish that the imminence of the peril may impel the Colonial authorities to adopt and enforce without delay all possible sanitary precautions. The accounts we have lately received of flagrant inattention as regards this important matter by the authorities at Bathurst and Sierra Leone, who are supposed to be charged with the responsibility of attending to it, are of a nature to deepen our alarm when we hear of Yellow Fever in the neighbourhood. All ordinary reasoning would have justified us in believing that when Her Majesty\'s Government adopted for Bathurst and Sierra Leone the most unusual, if not unprecedented, course of entrusting the local administration to gentlemen of the Army Medical Department, they had at least done what would insure that due attention would be given to sanitary measures. How are we to account for the result not having justified our belief? It cannot be that there were supreme orders that ""no money should be spent"" on what is so vital not only to the prosperity, but to the continued existence of British settlements on the West Coast; and if it be not owing to this, we say it with all proper respect for authorities appointed by the Queen, it cannot be otherwise accounted for than that these authorities are totally unfitted for the responsible posts entrusted to them. Should the Yellow Fever, and the virulent small-pox, its ordinary accompaniment on the West Coast, visit the settlements, their ravages cannot fail to be aggravated by that neglect of sanitary precautions of which complaint is continually reaching us; and the authorities, who have neglected those precautions, although they may not be made criminally liable, as they will have deserved, will at least incur a moral responsibility which may well overwhelm them, if their long familiarity with human sufferings under various diseases shall not have destroyed all ordinary feelings of humanity within their bosoms. We hope these observations from our pen will reach these authorities before the fearful visitants make their appearance; and that all past neglect will be atoned for by an activity as ardent as their apathy has been torpid. We call on all the authorities down the Coast, from Bathurst to Lagos—on all the masters of trading hulks at Bonny, Benin, New and Old Calabar, and Cameroons, and the heads of all trading stations on the South-west Coast, to commence without delay all possible sanitary measures. The Spanish Governor of Fernando Po would act wisely in taking similar precautions. Should the dreaded malady not spread southward from Senegal—as we fervently hope, but cannot believe will be the case—nothing will have been lost by the activity and expense that may have been made and exhibited. Sanitary measures, if properly conceived and carried into execution, must always be productive of benefit to the general health in the absence of virulent epidemics, as well as being influential in arresting and mitigating the spread and intensity of these when they do make their appearance. Among the blessings of British rule ought most certainly to be included a comparative immunity from epidemical diseases, owing to the adoption and enforcement of sanitary regulations; and it is time that efforts be really made in the British settlements on the West Coast to remove the natural stimulating agents of disease, and by sanitary police regulations put an end to all that filthiness which is represented to us as making the atmosphere of many of the Coast towns repulsively sickening and almost unbearable. Lessons in cleanliness are lessons in civilization; and there can be no reason that we know of why Sierra Leone, Bathurst, Cape Coast, Accra, and Lagos should not be made at least as healthy as Calcutta, Madras, and', 'last_edit_date': '1878-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1878#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.612, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sanitariums for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'M\'Carthy\'s Island, River Gambia, Dec. 20, 1864.\n\nMy Lord,—In the editorial article in the Lancet of October 13, page 442, we find the remark that ""it is a singular fact in medical geography that from St. Louis, Senegal, on the north, to Mossamedes, on the south, there is not upon the seaboard a single healthy acre of ground. The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria.

This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.627, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True
1246,"Colonial African prisons under British rule were characterized by inhumane conditions, severe physical punishment, and harsh labor practices, leading to lasting trauma and severe health consequences for prisoners.","The claim that colonial African prisons under British rule were characterized by inhumane conditions, severe physical punishment, and harsh labor practices, leading to lasting trauma and severe health consequences for prisoners, is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa provides context for the oppressive labor practices and physical punishment during colonial times, highlighting brutal methods used to recruit and maintain forced labor, including low wages, poor working conditions, and physical abuse. These practices suggest a punitive system that could easily extend to harsh prison environments, as evidenced by judicial floggings and the criminalization of labor breaches. The text also notes high mortality rates among laborers due to malnutrition, disease, and overwork, which could parallel the health consequences faced by prisoners, although it does not explicitly discuss prison conditions. In contrast, The African Times articles offer direct evidence of the claim, detailing the inhumane conditions within colonial prisons, such as prisoners being kept in chains, subjected to starvation, and forced to endure extreme physical punishments like shot-drill and treadmill exercises, which sometimes resulted in death, as in the case of Joseph Gordon. The articles also describe overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, inadequate medical care and nutrition, and a lack of differentiation in treatment between minor and serious offenders, illustrating a systemic disregard for prisoner well-being. Together, these sources paint a comprehensive picture of the brutal and dehumanizing nature of the colonial prison system in Africa under British rule.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that align with the claim regarding the inhumane conditions and harsh labor practices under colonial rule, though it does not specifically focus on prisons.

The articles describe prisoners being kept in chains, subjected to starvation, and forced to endure extreme physical punishments such as shot-drill and treadmill exercises, which were so severe that they led to deaths, as in the case of Joseph Gordon. The articles also highlight the overcrowded and unsanitary conditions of the prisons, with inadequate medical care and nutrition, contributing to the deterioration of prisoners' health. Furthermore, the articles mention the lack of differentiation in treatment between those imprisoned for minor offenses and those for serious crimes, indicating a systemic disregard for the well-being of prisoners.

Throughout this period editorials vigorously denounced and carefully documented the abuses inherent in the system of chíbalo. They protested against the brutal methods used by African sepÆis to recruit forced labour, the low wages and poor working conditions of the chíbalo labourers and the arbitrary and capricious actions of the European overseers. The editors were particularly incensed by the common practice of seizing 'African women to repair and construct roads, not even supplying them with food nor paying them a salary', while 'forcing them during the rainy season to sleep in mud-huts, beside the road, like slaves'. 105 The newspapers also unleashed a broadside attack on the conditions of employment of free African workers. They deplored the fact that peasants and nominally free agricultural workers were compelled to work on Euro› pean estates 'from sunrise until sunset earning hardly a shilling a month', that Mozambicans working in the South African mines are 'denied the right to select their own employers ... and die like flies in the mines', that African workers are arrested and beaten if they lack proper identifica› tion, and that the state used chíbalo labourers to break strikes and drive down wages of free workers.$^{106}$ The informal colour bar conventions, which froze Africans in the lowest paying jobs while reserving the most desirable employment for Europeans, was also the target of several editorials."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Capital and coercion, c. 1900-f. 1920', 'content': ""Undisguised forms of forced labour and barely disguised forms of slavery were prominent aspects of the entrenchment of the colonial economy in Africa.

Within a decade the system had spread to the other two areas and remained intact until almost the First World War. Indeed AndrØ Gide found substantial remnants in the late 1920s. 69 Great similarities existed in each of the systems. The Africans discovered that they no longer owned even their accumulated ivory and that they had to kill elephants for more ivory and scour the forest for rubber. Some of the most callous riffraff of Europe drifted in to become agents for the concessionaires, and to an extraordinary degree they were permitted to utilize the apparatus of the colonial administration including its army, police and courts. Taxation and compulsory labour, although in theory limited, were reinterpreted by the agents to mean such continuous work that crop planting and, consequently, diet suffered very considerably. The population grew reluctant to toil collecting, and to hand over what had always been communally theirs. Imprisonment was an unsatisfactory punishment as it reduced the available labour. Instead, floggings, mutila› tion, the taking as hostages of women and children, the burning of villages and a considerable amount of killing were employed.

Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""Much of this labour movement in the third of a century after 1880 was accompanied by appallingly high mortality.

Certainly the conditions of the work camps encouraged the spread of venereal disease and diarrhoea. The workers, carrying within themselves the great load of worms and agents of diseases commonly found in tropical Africa, worked more strenuously at times than they had learnt was possible for them, and came down with sickness.

In Southern Rhodesia this took place especially between 1908 and 1911 with grains. But even after the introduction of these two devices, most Africans were not attracted by wage employment on settler farms and plantations, mainly because of the hostile surroundings and conditions of work and the low wages. This state of affairs was not a peculiarity of Kenya and the Rhodesias since the rest of tropical Africa experienced the problem until the 1920s. 39 Thirdly, taxation was introduced or increased, not only to raise revenue, but to drive Africans to serve the interests of international capitalism. The guiding principle here was stated vividly by the governor of Kenya in 1913: We consider that taxation is the only possible method of compelling the native to leave his reserve for the purpose of seeking work. Only in this way can the cost of living be increased for the native ... it is on this that the supply of labour and the price of labour depend. To raise the rate of wages would not increase, but would diminish the supply of labour. 40 Fourthly, in many of the colonies forced labour was legalized. Africans were forced to provide work for a certain number of days in a year on public works and settler farms and plantations. This was done both during peace and war. Then, the notorious pass system, based on the South African experience, was introduced to regulate the supply of labour. It became effective in Kenya after July 1920. Every African adult male was required to carry a pass (kipande) on which the employer recorded, among other things, the kind of work performed, time worked and wages earned. Failure to carry, or loss of the kipande rendered Africans liable to a fine and/or imprisonment up to three months. The kipande greatly restricted the African's freedom of movement. A man could not leave his job of his own accord. The contractual relationship between employer and em› ployee became subject to the force of criminal law, and the former right of withholding labour became a criminal offence.

Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans.

Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'.

Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university.

Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

The facts are simply these: Mr. Martin Doorly, the paymaster of the 4th West India Regiment, was in the camp. He wanted money to pay the troops. He wrote to his son to send him up 200l., and instructed him to go to the Commissariat for it. The boy did so, Mr. Doorly writing at the same time to the Commissariat that he would be responsible. The Commissariat gave the money to the boy, and it was sent up privately (without an escort) to the camp, at Mr. Doorly's personal risk.

The Commandant, the Chief Magistrate—every Government officer down to the jailer—should blush at the revelations. The revelations which have taken place cast completely into the shade the awful disclosures made in the days of Mrs. Fry. Five or six beings crowded into one cell, no regular ablutions practised by the prisoners sunk into the slough of despair, solitary confinement carried to an unexampled excess, and, to crown all, no infirmaries provided within the prison for the sick and mentally and bodily afflicted. This is a state of things which must not be permitted any longer to exist, and I trust the practical and philanthropic mind of his Excellency Sir Arthur Kennedy, our popular Governor-in-chief, has been turned to it, and that if he deems it necessary he will institute a commission of inquiry to remedy these outrages against the laws of humanity.\nIt is quite useless for me to impress the people of Accra with the enormity of domestic slavery, when they can point out the state of our prisons, where we immure fellow-beings in a far worse than Egyptian slavery of old.

The evidence we now print is, to our mind, conclusive on this point. We were slow to believe it. When we first heard of the death of Joseph Gordon, and the verdict of the coroner\'s jury, we thought there must be some mistake. We were not disposed to imagine that an unfortunate petty criminal—a man sentenced to a few months\' imprisonment with hard labour—could have so aroused the evil passions of authorities or gaolers as to induce them to inflict on him an unwonted and fatal degree of punishment. And in this we were right, although wrong in our doubt as to the man having been murdered. Gordon was not in any way exceptionally treated. He was only one of many, all of whom were subject to the same system—a system so barbarous and atrocious that a better could scarcely have been devised if the killing off a percentage of the gaol population had been a deliberately contemplated result. Look at the evidence! The coroner\'s jury had returned a verdict that the man was killed by shot-drill and treadmill punishment. The Administrator of the colony, it appears, appoints and regulates the criminal employment. This was supposed to be appointed and regulated by Ordinance, the colony having a sort of legislative council. Admiral Patey, however, seems to have acted without Ordinance as regards shot-drill. He therefore rightly viewed the finding of the jury as involving something of a criminal charge against himself. He is consequently dissatisfied with it. He knows the power of quasi-omnipotent and irresponsible West African governors to elicit from subordinate officials and others in those colonies just such opinions as they themselves desire to have expressed, when the said governors refer matters to them. He therefore ordered Gordon\'s body to be exhumed and a post-mortem examination to be made. The surgeon found the right lung, liver, and spleen to be most extensively diseased, but believed the immediate cause of death to be inflammation of the lungs (vide No. 2). If the Administrator had possessed a particle of wisdom he would have stopped here. But the verdict of the jury had condemned his favourite shot-drill and treadmill exercise, and he would not stop there. He demands Dr. Waters\', the examining surgeon\'s, opinion as to whether the death was caused by those punishments, &c. It will be seen presently that in presenting the circumstances, he grossly misstated them in his own favour. Dr. Waters replies (No. 9) that ""in his opinion such hard labour would not directly produce inflammation of the lungs."" The Administrator refers to Dr. Burrows, the Chief Military Medical Officer, who makes a similar reply. The Chief Magistrate is then ""requested to give his opinion as to the legal effect of the verdict, and whether it was not the duty of the Coroner to direct the jury to find a specific verdict against some person,"" &c. (No. 7). Mr. Chalmers, the Magistrate, says (No. 8) that ""it is impossible to extract from the evidence such a verdict, no witness having stated the circumstances or the authority under which Gordon was subjected to the treadmill and shot-drill; an omission,"" he adds, ""the more remarkable that there is, apparently, an inconsistency in the infliction of these punishments upon a man selected for the responsible duty of hospital attendant."" This must have been ""touching the raw;"" but the Administrator is determined to go on tightening the rope, figuratively speaking, about his own neck. An additional inquiry is ordered. There is no power to take this evidence on oath, so it is taken on declaration, under the Act 5 and 6 William IV. To realise the full gravity of this evidence it must be read throughout. There are rules and regulations by Ordinance, but the Governor gives verbal orders to go beyond them, and the gaoler obeys. Hard labour was previously understood to be ""that the prisoners worked in gangs, in chains, in public or other works."" The present Administrator made an addition to this. He ordered that in addition they should have half an hour shot-drill in the morning, and half an hour treadmill in the evening. (Admiral Patey had stated it as ten minutes each to Dr. Waters.) While the Admiral was absent in England four months, the gaoler had discontinued these punishments; but when he heard he was coming back he falsified his journal to conceal his humanity. Admiral Patey calls him to account for it. He replied that he omitted them because the men have such heavy work on the sea-wall and drains. He then receives orders to resume the shot-drill and treadmill, and this is the routine: The men rise at half-past five, begin work at six (without food); are brought back to gaol at half-past nine, shot-drill till ten, then breakfast (their first food for the day), which consists of one pound of rice, boiled plain, with salt; then to work again till half-past four, treadmill till five, then dinner (their only other meal), consisting of half a pound of bread and half a pound of beef, including bone; then locked into cells at six. Thus, when placed on shot-drill, the men have been sixteen and a half hours without food, and on work three and a half hours of that time. No wonder that ""prisoners complain of their chests"" after their 24-pounder shot-drill; no wonder ""they fall down sweating"" at the treadmill. We repeat that to realise the full gravity of this evidence it must be read throughout. We are not squeamish about making prisoners work, but this evidence causes us an indescribable feeling of disgust and horror. We have given an account of the diet of these hard-labour prisoners to whose tasks daily shot-drill and treadmill were added by Admiral Patey—imposed by verbal order, without their having been prescribed by any Ordinance, ordered to be performed at hours when the men were exhausted by labour and long fasting. But that which constitutes the gravamen of the charge against Admiral Patey, is that he imposed and ordered, and inexorably exacted, these additional and trying labours without any previous medical examination of the men to know whether they were able to perform them without danger to their lives. Can anything be more atrocious than this? Are the lives of men, sentenced to seven days\' imprisonment because they cannot pay a fine imposed (see the Gordon evidence) to be thus trifled with by some insane Administrator?—for the most charitable presumption is that such a man must be insane. The medical evidence asserts that ""three-fourths of the natives who come under medical examination are ruptured"" (see No. 17); and yet this probably ruptured man, sentenced to seven days\' imprisonment as an alternative of a fine, is put on the treadmill and shot-drill! To be sure these men are only Africans, and the Administrator is an Englishman and a Rear-Admiral; yet, though they are so mean and he so exalted, we should scarcely have ventured to think that when the gaoler told him ""the shot-drill was too severe for the men, and that sometimes they fell off,"" he could have had the criminal inhumanity to reply, ""If any man falls off, you must keep him his time at it.""

It was a most distressing sight to witness the arrival of these poor creatures; and it is necessary to make a few preliminary remarks in order clearly to understand the difficulties with which the medical officers had to contend. The appearance of the slaves when landed was most striking. In some the expression of the countenance indicated sufferings, moral and physical, of the most profound and agonising nature. Others of them gazed vacantly around them in the most utter helplessness. Occasionally, among the newly-arrived groups all sense of suffering was merged in melancholic or raving madness. The wizened, shrunk, and skinny features were lighted up by the hollow, feverish eye. The belly was, as it were, tacked to the back, whilst the hip-bones protruded, and, in some cases, became the seat of foul, sloughing ulcers. The hand and skinny fingers seemed much elongated by the great and neglected growth of the nails, and they were so deplorably emaciated, that the skin appeared tensely stretched over, and tied down to the skeleton. The legs refused to perform their functions, and they reeled and tottered about from sheer debility. Their squalor and extreme wretchedness was heightened, in many cases, by the particoloured evacuations with which their bodies were besmeared. When large numbers of the sick were suffering from dysentery, the condition of the wards and yards in the morning was extremely loathsome. This was in a great degree unavoidable, as the sick were too weak to crawl from their mats to the commode, although everything was done under the surgeons\' orders to keep the wards as clean and wholesome as the crowded state of the hospital would admit of."" In a word, ""the moral and physical causes of depression were often so overwhelming, and so intensely concentrated, that the combination produced disease in such formidable shapes as to be beyond remedy. The mortality was consequently very great; many persons brought to the hospital in the last stage of disease died a few hours after their arrival; others even expired by the way. A large proportion died within a few days; and as the names of all these persons were recorded in the hospital books, the percentage of deaths was thereby largely increased.""\n\n*(To be continued.)*', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SLAVERY AND THE SLAVE-TRADE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In looking through the lamentable history of those times, it is impossible to prevent a feeling of nausea and disgust. We need only refer to one pamphlet, published in 1833, under the title, ""Three Months in Jamaica in 1832."" This little publication had an enormous sale, and did much to rouse the British nation to a sense of the enormities daily committed in her distant colonies. The author went out to Jamaica with the intention of residing in a business capacity on a sugar plantation. He was one of those who did not believe in the horrors of slavery, and thought that our factory children in England were worse off than any plantation slaves. He was soon undeceived. Proceeding on horseback to the estate soon after his arrival, and enjoying the exquisite tropical scenery, he came upon a gang of negroes at work, most of them females. As he rode past the driver cracked his tremendous whip, shouting out, ""Work! work!"" and from that moment the enchanting scenery and the beautiful humming-birds of Jamaica had no longer any charm for him. The first evening of his arrival at the plantation the overseer gave the command, ""Blow shell!"" A large shell was blown, and four athletic negro drivers appeared, bringing in six slaves. For some slight defect in the tally of the day\'s work these men had to be flogged. The flogging of the men is described in terms too painful to repeat; but worst of all is the account given of similar punishments inflicted upon women, some of them quite young girls. The author took pains to inquire whether this treatment was general, and he came to the conclusion that it was next to impossible to find a slave, either male or female, who had not been flogged. But this was only one and the most ordinary form of punishment; the stocks and contrivances for hanging negroes by their thumbs, wrists, etc., were only too common, whilst hundreds were killed outright. This picture is too revolting to contemplate at the present day, and to us now it appears almost incredible.\n\nIt is refreshing to record the feelings of joy and gratitude with which Mr. Buxton and his friends received the accounts of ""the admirable conduct of the negroes on the great day of freedom."" Mr. Buxton says: ""Throughout the colonies the churches and chapels had been thrown open, and the slaves had crowded into them on the evening of the 31st of July, 1834. As the hour of midnight approached they fell upon their knees, and awaited the solemn moment, all hushed in silent prayer. When twelve o\'clock sounded they sprang upon their feet, and through every island rang the glad sound of thanksgiving to the Father of All, for the chains were broken, and the slaves were free.""', 'last_edit_date': '1884-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1884#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATED SIERRA LEONE BRITISH SUBJECTS AND SLAVE DEALING.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The publication of the official Correspondence relative to the case of the slave girl in whose murder at Onitsha on the Niger two coloured men, named John and Williams, formerly in the service of the Church Missionary Society, were implicated, is calculated to deepen the feeling of indignation with which that brutal crime was regarded by the public when the facts of the case were first made known. The depositions of the witnesses, which are now for the first time published in this country, show that indescribable cruelties were committed by these ruffians and their accomplices, among whom, it will be remembered, was the wife of Williams. Two slave girls were subjected to frightful brutalities, although fortunately only one died. They were tied back to back and severely flogged by the man John, and by Mrs. Williams. Then a troop of school children were actually sent for to continue the flogging, and many of the boys, it appears, supplied themselves with sticks from a guava tree, and shamefully beat the poor girls in the presence of the ex-missionaries and their wives. Subsequently they were cruelly tortured with cayenne pepper; one of them—Amé by name—dying in the course of the night, a bottle of rum being given to the man who buried her to bribe him not to tell what had happened. The culprits richly merited the severe sentences which were ultimately passed upon them; but many readers of the Correspondence will be disposed to think that it was a case which called for the infliction of the extreme penalty of the law, at all events against two of the offenders. The prosecution was beset with difficulties, owing to the fact that the outrages were committed in districts beyond British jurisdiction. Ultimately a Commission was appointed under the Great Seal for the trial of the prisoners, but the Commissioners nevertheless describe this machinery as ""cumbrous,"" and as ""extremely difficult in the working."" We are glad to learn that under the provisions of a new Order in Council the administration of justice in similar cases seems likely to be simplified. A slave-dealer named Astrop gave an extraordinary piece of information to the authorities of the Gold Coast.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

From the evidence given at the trial it appears that a Frenchman named Tampier, an overseer on the estate of M. de Chazal, one of the most humane planters in the Mauritius, was visiting a field in which a number of labourers were employed, when being displeased with the manner in which one of the coolies performed his task, he struck the man, knocked him down, and, leaping upon his prostrate body, stamped and kicked until his passion expended its strength. The victim died of this treatment within half-an-hour. Notwithstanding this fact, the jury at Tampier\'s first trial could not agree as to their verdict.

We pulled hard, but the cruel demons of men had broken the skull and marked the water with the man\'s blood; the poor fellow sunk just as Mr. Thomson was about to stretch out his hand to rescue. When the men in the canoe saw him sink, and that we were too late, they gave a savage shout of triumph. They landed amongst a large crowd of people on the beach; I followed them, and told them of their sin, and that it would be remembered against them.""\n\nIn another letter Mr. Smith continues the narrative: ""The slaves, who are powerful in numbers, were very angry, and banded themselves together the following morning and made an attack on the town, driving the freemen and their masters before them. Those who had committed the deed took shelter on mission-ground. The \'country-fashion,\' or superstition house, was burnt down; nearly all the plantain-trees were destroyed and two men wounded.

Several headmen from A\'kwa town, myself, and two or three members, went amongst them, and got them, after much difficulty, to retire to their own quarters. Much inconvenience was felt by prohibiting the wives of the freemen going to their farms and obtaining food. Many were their threatenings, and it is a mercy no lives were lost; we were amongst them continually, heard their complaints, and sought to satisfy them. In a few days King A\'kwa returned home, had a meeting, and settled the serious palaver.

This supports the notion of inadequate public health measures, although the text does not specifically mention smallpox outbreaks in Accra and Cape Palmas or directly link these outbreaks to governance and legal complications. In contrast, The African Times articles offer substantial evidence of the severe impact of smallpox, reporting thousands of deaths in Accra and Cape Palmas and highlighting the lack of effective vaccination campaigns due to resistance and insufficient medical supplies. The articles detail the challenges faced by medical personnel, such as Dr. Horton and Dr. Fletcher, in promoting vaccination amidst local skepticism and logistical difficulties. They also discuss the broader implications on governance, with criticisms of colonial authorities for neglecting sanitary conditions and inadequate public health measures. Legal and governance complications are illustrated by cases like Abudukadiri, where smallpox influenced a legal trial, and the administrative burdens on officials like Dr. Allan.

To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease.

Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s. Nevertheless, tropical medical schools were established in Europe as early as 1897 in Liverpool and London, 1900 in Hamburg, 1901 in Brussels, followed later by Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles, and in Africa by 1912 in Cape Town and 1918 in Dakar."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.737, 'probability_score': 0.054, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""In tropical Africa governmental medicine was long a military concern although small civilian hospitals began to appear in the 1890s. From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.728, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy of the former French, Belgian and Portuguese zones, 1914-35', 'section_title': ""The workers' burden > The crises and their repercussions > Food shortage, famine and epidemic"", 'content': ""Taken all round, however, the catastrophe was less spectacular.

The purchasing power of the natives was reduced to a greater extent than in any of the earlier crises.' 48 It is revealing that, in Francophone Africa, large-scale urban immigration began precisely when the great crisis occurred. Notwithstanding the overall stagnation in population growth (in AOF 14.4 million inhabitants in 1931, as compared with 14.6 million in 1936), the towns and cities began to be swollen by the massive influx of destitute peasants, in spite of the fact that the urban employment situation was also critical.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered.

Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""Much of this labour movement in the third of a century after 1880 was accompanied by appallingly high mortality.

Without doubt the upsetting of stable populations, leading in the Congo Free State and elsewhere in Middle Africa to an upsurge in the death rate, the slow reduction in mortality in other parts of the continent during the nineteenth century and generally in this century, and the accelerating nucleation of population in towns and on mining fields owed nearly everything to the industrial revolution and to increasing contact with people from industrial societies. Much of this process would have occurred even without colonial rule: the traders would have provoked trading centres into growth; European medical schools would have become interested in the problem of protecting the traders and others from tropical disease; missionaries would have laid the foundations of a hospital system.\nNevertheless, direct colonial rule certainly speeded up all these processes. Eventually, and certainly towards the end of our period, it helped to reduce the great peaks of mortality by increasingly and effectively importing and utilizing epidemic control technology and creating a modern transport system which could distribute food in areas of famine. The need for administrative centres provided a nucleus for new towns, and colonial administrations' guarantees of personal safety and investment security to the nationals of their metropolitan countries hastened the growth of com› mercial settlements, mining camps and plantations. Without colonial administrations European entrepreneurs might well have been even more rapacious and murderous than they were. Europeans usually justified the colonial penetration by pointing to these achievements.

Indeed AndrØ Gide found substantial remnants in the late 1920s. 69 Great similarities existed in each of the systems. The Africans discovered that they no longer owned even their accumulated ivory and that they had to kill elephants for more ivory and scour the forest for rubber. Some of the most callous riffraff of Europe drifted in to become agents for the concessionaires, and to an extraordinary degree they were permitted to utilize the apparatus of the colonial administration including its army, police and courts. Taxation and compulsory labour, although in theory limited, were reinterpreted by the agents to mean such continuous work that crop planting and, consequently, diet suffered very considerably. The population grew reluctant to toil collecting, and to hand over what had always been communally theirs. Imprisonment was an unsatisfactory punishment as it reduced the available labour.

It is more difficult, but perhaps not impossible, to imagine that the level of disease (venereal disease and other infections) generated during this period still resulted in a high level of female sterility half a century or more afterwards. It is also difficult to feel that the situation in this region is adequately covered by a recent United Nations' publication writing of'cultural shock' and 'the processes of adjustment'. 71 Eventually the colonial penetration was to lead to a great increase in population. This was partly due to the establishment of an economic base which is evidenced by many developments discussed in several of the chapters above. Some of the more spectacular of them were the develop› ment of palm-oil exports from the Niger delta, the discovery of diamonds and then gold in Southern Africa in the years from 1870 to 1900, the development of an indigenous cocoa-growing industry in the Gold Coast in the 1890s and the discovery of huge deposits of copper between the Congo and Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) in the early years of the century."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Finally, what is the record of colonialism in the social field? The first important beneficial social effect was the overall increase of the population of Africa during the colonial period by about 37.5%, as J. C. Caldwell has shown (Chapter 18), after its decline during the first two or three decades of colonialism. This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization. As A. E. Afigbo has emphasized (Chapter 19), urban› ization was of course not unknown in pre-colonial Africa. The kingdoms and empires of Africa had such capitals or political centres as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, Gao and Great Zimbabwe; such commercial centres as Kano, Jenne, Sofala and Malindi, and such educational centres as Timbuktu, Cairo and Fez. But there is no doubt that as a result of colonial› ism, the pace of urbanization was greatly accelerated. Completely new towns such as Abidjan in Ivory Coast, Takoradi in the Gold Coast, Port Harcourt and Enugu in Nigeria, Nairobi in Kenya, Salisbury (now Harare) in Southern Rhodesia, Lusaka in Northern Rhodesia and Luluabourg in the Kasai Province of the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) came into existence.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""Certainly in some areas stable administrations apparently resulted in increasing populations in the nineteenth century, such as apparently occurred in Egypt from early in the century as Muhammad$^{ c}$Alî extended irrigation and sanitation$^{53}$ and in Algeria after the French subjugated all opposition in 1879.$^{54}$ The necessity for such stability, especially as civilian instead of military administration became the rule around the turn of the century, arose out of the metropolitan powers' demand that their colonial administrations in Africa should be financially self-supporting.$^{55}$ Hence the increasing concentration on communications and export production.\nPerhaps the major demographic problem in the years up to the First World War centres on the so-called 'labour question' and on the conces› sionaire schemes of Middle Africa.\nIn the late nineteenth century it was the central belief of colonizers that colonies should be profitable. Whether this could be achieved or not depended entirely on African labour. Profits depended on moving goods and this meant human porterage in most of tropical Africa, for the tsetse fly often prevented the use of draught animals and the lack of roads or railways prevented powered and wheeled vehicles being used. In Middle Africa the most profitable produce was at first ivory which entailed huge quantities of labour for carrying tusks. With the development of the pneumatic bicycle tyre in the late 1880s and the pneumatic car tyre in the 1890s a huge demand for rubber was created, which could not be met for a generation by plantation rubber (the first Malayan plantation came into production in 1910).

The filthy condition of that town, fully exposed in late numbers of this journal, must without doubt tend to the increase of its severity, as well as to the number of attacks. A few years since (six, we believe), after great ravages of smallpox at Accra, when Dr. Gunn, who was at that time on the station, vaccinated a very considerable number of the native population, and thus, it was considered, did much to arrest the onward progress of the fatal disorder, we more than once called attention to the subject, in the hope that the British authorities in the settlements of this country on the Coast, would take some effectual measures for bringing the population gradually under that degree of protection which vaccination undoubtedly affords. We do not say what that degree is; but, looking at the European population in the present day, with their smooth, unmarked faces, we find they present so marked a contrast to those of the generation passed away, as to establish beyond dispute that the degree is a very considerable one. It is, therefore, greatly to be regretted that our self-martyrising, zealous Administrators on the West Coast, while ""wearing themselves to the very verge of the grave"" in their arduous exertions for the good of the native population, have not paid more attention to this important matter of the employment of preventive means for arresting the spread of that terrible scourge of Africa—smallpox—among the native people. In another column we publish a short account of an experience in this matter in the East Indies, where the prejudice against, or rather disbelief in the benefit of vaccination, has far exceeded anything of the kind experienced in Africa. Indeed, Dr. Gunn assured us at the time of the Accra outbreak, the people came willingly and with strong expressions of gratitude to obtain the protection (then proved in their eyes to be real) which vaccination affords. Whether the self-made Martyr Administrator of Cape Coast returns there, or some other aspirant martyr be sent out, we beg once again to express the hope that, by the formation of a vaccine institution, or by giving a fee per head to the Army and Colonial Surgeons for every child or adult properly and effectively vaccinated by them, or by some other active and dependable means, the native population in the future may be less exposed to the ravages of smallpox than it has been in the past.

Similarly, The African Times articles describe instances of diseases such as African fever, smallpox, and yellow fever affecting both populations, with significant mortality, as seen in the crew of the small barque Mary Anne and Dr. Kirk's report from Zanzibar. The articles also highlight social disruption, such as the abandonment of ivory caravans and impacts on trade, exacerbated by unsanitary conditions in towns like Cape Coast. The movement of infected individuals, like a prisoner from Accra bringing smallpox, further spread diseases.

To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease. Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively. Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s. Nevertheless, tropical medical schools were established in Europe as early as 1897 in Liverpool and London, 1900 in Hamburg, 1901 in Brussels, followed later by Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles, and in Africa by 1912 in Cape Town and 1918 in Dakar."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.763, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns against epidemic disease apparently gained some success. The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered.

In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo* Basin and Angola', 'section_title': 'Demography, society and politics in high-density areas', 'content': ""The development of more-complex agricultural communities had import› ant consequences for the demography of Central Africa. It is generally considered that communities that gradually take up agriculture and animal husbandry continue for a long time to show a low annual growth rate (between 0.05 and 0.10 per cent), which is fairly close to the known growth rate of hunting and food-gathering communities. On the other hand, communities with a more diversified agriculture have a much higher annual growth rate, put between 0.10 and 0.15 per cent. Figures for a difficult natural environment like that of Africa are unknown: but they are no doubt not very far from this model. Spread over more than two centuries, an increase of this order in the growth rate would have had a considerable effect on the overall population of Central Africa. 6\nCompared with twentieth-century growth rates these figures admittedly seem low. The fact is that in early African communities the death rate remained high. For the nineteenth century the main causes of death are known, but it is impossible to determine the extent of each one's con› tribution to the total.\nFirst, there were historical factors, especially the slave trade and its attendant violence. While the manpower drain of the slave trade to America was sharply reduced as from the 1850s, the Swahili and Arab trade took over to the east and north of our area. Figures can be given of overall losses for the whole of Central Africa,$^{7}$ but it is unlikely that it will ever be possible to give a geographical breakdown, especially as the continual movement of groups and individuals spread the impact of the slave trade far and wide.\nThere were also ecological and epidemiological factors. The nineteenth century certainly saw the beginnings of medical progress in Central Africa, such as better knowledge of endemic diseases, use of vaccination and more general use of quinine. But this progress remained confined to the circles visited by traders from Angola or the Swahili coast. By and large the changes were too limited to defeat the major endemic diseases or epidemic outbreaks. 8"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': 'until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

Smallpox vaccination was on such a small scale that by the late 1930s a significant reduction of the disease had probably taken place only in the Gold Coast and southern Nigeria. 93 In contrast, contact with Europeans and participation in the First World War ensured that the influenza epidemic of 1918-19 swept through Africa probably resulting in the highest annual death rate this century, although the rise in death rates was probably not as great as in Asia, for many African populations were still protected by comparative isolation. Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.745, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""However, the development which probably had the earliest impact on the mortality level was the penetration of the roads and railways. By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths. From 50 to 80 per cent have or have had syphilis or yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm,"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A fragile population emerging from near stability', 'content': 'This picture is not in any way surprising.

Given the mortality levels described above (which is a conservative assumption in view of the fact that the health conditions of the forests of the west coast equatorial area have probably long been worse than elsewhere), the conclu› sion could be drawn that in the centuries past those areas averaging 5 births per woman had experienced population declines averaging over 0.5 per cent per annum, and those averaging 3.5 children declines of over 1.5 per cent per annum. This is inconceivable over any protracted period; the latter population would be halving every forty years, and both situations suggest much larger populations during the earlier years of European contact than has ever been suggested.

The Akamba in Kenya and the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika were involved in the caravan trade from the interior to the coast - a phenomenon often referred to as long-distance trade.$^{5}$ The Baganda as well as the Wanga in Kenya had also had contact with Arabs trading in ivory and slaves prior to the 1890s. Again the degree of exposure to these outside influences determined the type and extent of resistance put up by various societies.\nApart from these human influences, there were ecological changes taking place in East Africa in the 1890s, which also affected response to foreign penetration. The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all. A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya.

In 1880 a European presence inland from the coast was largely restricted to Algeria, where a third of a million migrants, mainly from France, Spain, Italy and Malta, had consolidated the victory of the French army, and South Africa, where a similar number of Europeans, predominantly of Dutch and English extraction, now had a vanguard as far north as the Limpopo river.

Lugard laid much stress on this, claiming that Nigeria's more deserted areas were evidence of periodic devastation.$^{48}$ Certainly there was some insecurity in pre-colonial Africa, as is evidenced by the defensive location of many villages from which 'downhill movements' of farmers to better agricultural locations occurred after their safety could be guaranteed. 49 The claim of greater security was true in the long run but highly questionable during the first decades. African instability had been exacerbated by the European contact. In any case it was almost certainly exaggerated by both European administrators and missionaries, each seeking to justify the kind of new order that they had brought.

What was less frequently emphasized by the new regimes was the heavy loss of life arising in parts of Africa from their intervention. The deaths were rarely a product of the original extension of administration, but rather of the suppression of subsequent revolts and of the ensuing punitive expeditions which apparently often inflicted most damage because of starvation resulting from the upsetting of the subsistence farming cycle. Examples include the thousands killed in Senegal in 1886 when opposing the building of a railway$^{51}$ and in the Ndebele war in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in 1893, the long-drawn-out suppression of the BÆtetela rebellion in the Congo Free State from 1895 to 1907, and a series of episodes in German South West Africa (now Namibia) between 1901 and 1906.

It is more difficult, but perhaps not impossible, to imagine that the level of disease (venereal disease and other infections) generated during this period still resulted in a high level of female sterility half a century or more afterwards. It is also difficult to feel that the situation in this region is adequately covered by a recent United Nations' publication writing of'cultural shock' and 'the processes of adjustment'. 71 Eventually the colonial penetration was to lead to a great increase in population. This was partly due to the establishment of an economic base which is evidenced by many developments discussed in several of the chapters above. Some of the more spectacular of them were the develop› ment of palm-oil exports from the Niger delta, the discovery of diamonds and then gold in Southern Africa in the years from 1870 to 1900, the development of an indigenous cocoa-growing industry in the Gold Coast in the 1890s and the discovery of huge deposits of copper between the Congo and Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) in the early years of the century."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.712, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Finally, what is the record of colonialism in the social field? The first important beneficial social effect was the overall increase of the population of Africa during the colonial period by about 37.5%, as J. C. Caldwell has shown (Chapter 18), after its decline during the first two or three decades of colonialism. This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization. As A. E. Afigbo has emphasized (Chapter 19), urban› ization was of course not unknown in pre-colonial Africa. The kingdoms and empires of Africa had such capitals or political centres as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, Gao and Great Zimbabwe; such commercial centres as Kano, Jenne, Sofala and Malindi, and such educational centres as Timbuktu, Cairo and Fez. But there is no doubt that as a result of colonial› ism, the pace of urbanization was greatly accelerated.

In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'These were the major forces determining population change but there were undoubtedly others.

By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent. There were two reasons for the trade: firstly that alcohol could be produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits; secondly, in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, there were real problems about what goods would be accepted in return for the produce of Africa.$^{43}$ Mary Kingsley found the trade spirit pure and likely to do less harm than cannabis,$^{44}$ a view shared by a committee that investigated the liquor trade in içoç.$^{45}$ Spirits were distributed on a huge scale, frequently as wages.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The frightful condition in which the slaves are landed from the captured slavers at Sierra Leone is vividly depicted:—\n\n""At the period I took charge of the Kissy Hospitals (1837) the slave-trade was in active operation, consequently great numbers of liberated Africans were constantly received into hospital. It was a most distressing sight to witness the arrival of these poor creatures; and it is necessary to make a few preliminary remarks in order clearly to understand the difficulties with which the medical officers had to contend. The appearance of the slaves when landed was most striking. In some the expression of the countenance indicated sufferings, moral and physical, of the most profound and agonising nature. Others of them gazed vacantly around them in the most utter helplessness. Occasionally, among the newly-arrived groups all sense of suffering was merged in melancholic or raving madness. The wizened, shrunk, and skinny features were lighted up by the hollow, feverish eye. The belly was, as it were, tacked to the back, whilst the hip-bones protruded, and, in some cases, became the seat of foul, sloughing ulcers. The hand and skinny fingers seemed much elongated by the great and neglected growth of the nails, and they were so deplorably emaciated, that the skin appeared tensely stretched over, and tied down to the skeleton. The legs refused to perform their functions, and they reeled and tottered about from sheer debility. Their squalor and extreme wretchedness was heightened, in many cases, by the particoloured evacuations with which their bodies were besmeared. When large numbers of the sick were suffering from dysentery, the condition of the wards and yards in the morning was extremely loathsome. This was in a great degree unavoidable, as the sick were too weak to crawl from their mats to the commode, although everything was done under the surgeons\' orders to keep the wards as clean and wholesome as the crowded state of the hospital would admit of."" In a word, ""the moral and physical causes of depression were often so overwhelming, and so intensely concentrated, that the combination produced disease in such formidable shapes as to be beyond remedy. The mortality was consequently very great; many persons brought to the hospital in the last stage of disease died a few hours after their arrival; others even expired by the way. A large proportion died within a few days; and as the names of all these persons were recorded in the hospital books, the percentage of deaths was thereby largely increased.""\n\n*(To be continued.)*', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Introduction of Present Epidemic of Small-pox into Cape Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—That dreadful disease the small-pox is raging fearfully here, and friends dear and precious in our eyes, and who might otherwise have been our joy for many long years to come, have been swept away by it.

The filthy condition of that town, fully exposed in late numbers of this journal, must without doubt tend to the increase of its severity, as well as to the number of attacks. A few years since (six, we believe), after great ravages of smallpox at Accra, when Dr. Gunn, who was at that time on the station, vaccinated a very considerable number of the native population, and thus, it was considered, did much to arrest the onward progress of the fatal disorder, we more than once called attention to the subject, in the hope that the British authorities in the settlements of this country on the Coast, would take some effectual measures for bringing the population gradually under that degree of protection which vaccination undoubtedly affords. We do not say what that degree is; but, looking at the European population in the present day, with their smooth, unmarked faces, we find they present so marked a contrast to those of the generation passed away, as to establish beyond dispute that the degree is a very considerable one. It is, therefore, greatly to be regretted that our self-martyrising, zealous Administrators on the West Coast, while ""wearing themselves to the very verge of the grave"" in their arduous exertions for the good of the native population, have not paid more attention to this important matter of the employment of preventive means for arresting the spread of that terrible scourge of Africa—smallpox—among the native people. In another column we publish a short account of an experience in this matter in the East Indies, where the prejudice against, or rather disbelief in the benefit of vaccination, has far exceeded anything of the kind experienced in Africa. Indeed, Dr. Gunn assured us at the time of the Accra outbreak, the people came willingly and with strong expressions of gratitude to obtain the protection (then proved in their eyes to be real) which vaccination affords. Whether the self-made Martyr Administrator of Cape Coast returns there, or some other aspirant martyr be sent out, we beg once again to express the hope that, by the formation of a vaccine institution, or by giving a fee per head to the Army and Colonial Surgeons for every child or adult properly and effectively vaccinated by them, or by some other active and dependable means, the native population in the future may be less exposed to the ravages of smallpox than it has been in the past. The records of travellers and explorers establish incontestably that smallpox is the great fatal disease of Africa.

The opinions we put forward with regard to the climate of West Africa have not been hastily or crudely formed, nor have they been adopted to serve some temporary or interested purpose. They are the result of evidence that cannot be disproved. They are promulgated by us to remove prejudices which war against our efforts for the advancement of civilization in Africa, and because we feel that they are pregnant with most practical results. We do not, for instance, pretend that the West African climate is not unhealthy. We admit that it is. But we as fearlessly contend that it is not one whit more unhealthy for Europeans than many of the West India Islands, or than Hong Kong, China, or India, &c. These regions are equally liable to visitations of epidemic disease as is West Africa, in the shape of yellow fever, dysentery, &c. We are, moreover, firmly convinced that if ever the day arrives when complete, and not mere partial statistical tables, are compiled, showing the mortality amongst Europeans at the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and even the new settlement at Lagos, the facts fairly and impartially revealed will demonstrate that at least a moiety of the deaths which occur amongst them are not the result of climatic disease, but are chargeable occasionally to accident; more frequently to a lamentable and wanton neglect of ordinary care and precautions; and too often to reckless indulgences, which will in any climate sap the springs of life, and ultimately destroy it. As additional evidences in support of these statements, take, for example, the records with regard to the numerous governors who have served, or are now serving, in West Africa. We find that in most instances they were and are men who had passed middle life before being called upon to administer those Governments, and were consequently far less able to bear up against attacks of fever. Yet, of the thirty-four gentlemen who have governed Sierra Leone from 1792 to 1864, seven only died there in that long period of seventy-two years. Of those seven, one was killed in action, another veteran most unwisely made fruit and vegetables his sole diet; and one of them had previously lived upwards of thirty-five years in the colony, dying at sea, not of disease incident to the climate, but of cancer of the stomach.

Nor do you make any distinction between the colonies, classing Sierra Leone with Lagos, Gambia, and Cape Coast, which I am sure the facts would not warrant.\n\nTo revert, however, to the causes of mortality on the West Coast of Africa, I am of opinion that there are many influential causes conducing to the same which might be prevented, and I take the liberty of intruding on your valuable space to enumerate one or two of them.\n\n1. The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics. In Brazil, no doubt, some Europeans drink themselves to death, but they are few; the majority, being of a better class, prefer to live well and to enjoy themselves rationally, without making beasts of themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'So much has been said and written about the climate of West Africa, and it has been so long the fashion to abuse and condemn it without inquiry, that the medical profession, like the general public, have accepted and endorsed the common report as an established fact.

We make these remarks by way of introducing to more general notice the papers above noted, because they supply much valuable and novel information, not only regarding the diseases to which Europeans and natives are subject in West Africa, but because they furnish an interesting description of the topography of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.\n\nMr. Clarke is of opinion that the climate of West Africa, if fairly tested, can stand comparison in point of healthfulness with most of our colonies in the East or West Indies, where endemic and epidemic fevers, dysentery, with cholera to boot, prevail quite as frequently and fatally. There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years.

Among these were British settlers who had been brought to the Cape in 1820 to boost the Colony's scanty and predominantly Dutch population. Most of these nearly 5000 settlers had been sent to the new district of Albany where they held about 40 ha (100 acres) each. Although they may not have realized it, one of the main considerations for the establishment of the Albany settlement, as far as Governor Somerset was concerned, was that the settlers would assist with the defence and stabilization of the notorious Eastern Frontier.\nThe Cape Colony's economic situation and prospects had never been bright. The dangerous military situation on the frontier was simply aggra› vating the economic problems. The 1820 settlers were in a worse situation than the Dutch farmers living in the old districts of the Colony. By 1823, there were already indications that agriculture, expected to be Albany's staple economic activity and the main source of livelihood, was going to be a huge flop. To start with, many of the new farmers were not qualified to do the work for which they had been brought to Africa. There was also a general complaint that the holdings were too small. Then came floods in 1822 that destroyed all the crops. Many farmers had abandoned their land by 1823 and those that still held on had lost their original enthusiasm and were broken in spirit. With the small amounts of capital they had brought from Britain rapidly dwindling, many were either heavily in debt to the government for rations or were facing destitution. Excessive drinking was on the increase as many a broken heart sought to drown its worries and sorrows. 10 With just about a third of the original number of the farmers still on their plots in 1823 and facing formidable odds, the whole future of the Albany settlement as an agricultural venture was highly doubtful. As already pointed out, the rest of the farmers had abandoned their holdings, some opting for other forms of employment in urban centres, or setting themselves up as independent traders, and many more taking to cattlefarming."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.582, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A fragile population emerging from near stability', 'content': 'they grew, but only at a modest rate, because they were still subject to the ravages of fearful diseases.

It is commonly assumed that the major constraint on population numbers in traditional societies has been the availability of food. However, E. Boserup has argued that critical population densities do not lead to a Malthusian situation but to changes in the methods of cultivation: 'the low rates of population growth found (until recently) in pre-industrial communities cannot be explained as the result of insufficient food supplies due to overpopulation, and we must leave room for other factors in the explanation of demographic trends ... medical, biological, political, etc.'$^{22}$ The African past may well have been more complex than this and the ultimate bounds may have been those of food resources, even though infrequently brought into play. The land available for farming was that land not proscribed by other uses; for instance, the nearly deserted land between warring kingdoms had alternative employment as a no-man's land. In much of the continent little land appeared to be in use at any one time, either because slash-and-burn or savanna shifting cultivation meant that most land at any given time was fallow or because hunters and food gatherers needed huge areas for their support. Only occasionally did extreme famine conditions strike, caused by drought or locusts or by the disorganization arising from war or epidemic. The crisis was usually too sudden to allow any substantial temporary invasion of the fallow,$^{23}$ and in effect the limits of the carrying capacity of the land were reached with resulting huge mortality and a drop in population numbers for decades. The pressure on the capacity of the system to produce food was usually - but not always - too short and sudden to produce the successive changes in methods of land use that Boserup describes. Such changes are most likely when population numbers push persistently against the food-producing capacity of the cultivation system either in a situation where the great peaks of mortality have been reduced by health measures or other actions or where luck or geographical conditions moderate those peaks. For decades subsequent to the crisis, populations remained well below the level at which they pressed on food supplies;$^{24}$ they grew, but only at a modest rate, because they were still subject to the ravages of fearful diseases.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered. Yellow fever epidemics have occurred from Senegal to Sudan at unpredictable intervals. By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.586, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': ""Famines and psychological stress also left the uprooted and malnourished vulnerable to infectious diseases carried by the coastal traders. Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

The purchasing power of the natives was reduced to a greater extent than in any of the earlier crises.' 48 It is revealing that, in Francophone Africa, large-scale urban immigration began precisely when the great crisis occurred. Notwithstanding the overall stagnation in population growth (in AOF 14.4 million inhabitants in 1931, as compared with 14.6 million in 1936), the towns and cities began to be swollen by the massive influx of destitute peasants, in spite of the fact that the urban employment situation was also critical. In 1936, for example, there were still no more than 167000 wage-earners in AOF, which was hardly more than 1% of the population. Nevertheless, between 1931 and 1936 the populations of Dakar and Abidjan increased by 71%, while that of Conakry doubled. Even more revealing is the case of an impoverished little town in the interior like Ouagadougou which, reversing its previous trend, increased its population by one-third over the same period. The overall stagnation in population growth during this period is parti› cularly indicative of the prevailing state of poverty. For social expenditure, was, by contrast, tending everywhere to rise: the parallel increase in ex› penditure on health care, and in the number of dispensaries and treatment facilities tended effectively to curb the traditional scourges (trypanoso› miasis, venereal diseases, leprosy). By contrast, populations proved to be particularly vulnerable during the taxing period 1931-6 to epidemics ('sporadic illnesses': influenza, smallpox, etc.).

Butler called Albany, were expected to use free labour from Britain. However, most of such labourers brought from Britain had deserted their masters on arrival in South Africa and had gone to urban centres where prospects were thought to be brighter. Desperate efforts were being made to encourage further migration to the Colony. Of those who responded to the call to migrate to the Cape Colony, most of them Irish workers, only a very insignificant trickle actually reached the Eastern Frontier Districts. Many bought their freedom on arrival at the Cape, and sought careers elsewhere. In the circumstances, therefore, the new settlers were compelled to rely on themselves, their wives and children to do 'the most menial tasks' normally reserved for labourers and slaves. 12 All these hardships were aggravated by the need for the farmers and all able-bodied people to go from time to time to the Eastern Frontier for defence duties.\nIn an effort to alleviate the financial hardships of the distressed settler farmers, some people formed an organization known as the Society for the Relief of the Distressed Settlers to raise funds for them.

Local industry stood up well to competition, and a balanced budget continued to be ensured thanks to esparto exports. 89 But the continual food shortage from 1881 to 1889 was the first sign of far-reaching change. Exports suffered. In addition, the market price of esparto collapsed, the volume of imported foodstuffs increased and from 1892 onwards the balance of trade showed a deficit. This deficit assumed huge proportions and became permanent after 1897. For, from that time onwards, the food requirements of the masses changed.

Southern Angolan societies were split up into a great variety of peoples distinguished from each other by their terrain and the varying importance they attached to agriculture and stockbreeding. Ethnic solidarity among the peoples of this region resulted from sharing a common historical experience; that is, both political experience in the form of states that developed from the end of the eighteenth century onwards and also economic experience dictated by environmental similarities. All these peoples, of whom the Kwanyama 12 are the most numerous, have come to be known as the Ovambo. Next among the Ovambo, but much smaller, come the Ndongo, Kwambi, etc. They all live in the Cuvelai river basin, in an area bounded by the Cunene and the Cubango (Okavango). The rise of the Cuvelai and the flooding of the grassy savannas enabled the Ovambo to overcome the drought and make the inhabited areas of the region described by nineteenth-century travellers look like gardens. The Ovambo irrigated and, thanks to their livestock, also manured their farms."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.572, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy of the former French, Belgian and Portuguese zones, 1914-35', 'section_title': ""The workers' burden > The crises and their repercussions > Food shortage, famine and epidemic"", 'content': ""There were situations of severe famine such as that in Niger in 1930, of which Zerma-Sonrai still have memories, followed by an invasion of locusts.

Since, in the lowlands, the period of hunger was also the period of heaviest labour demand for cultivating and sowing of grains in the first rains, the occasional markets provided a means of overcoming rather quickly the excessively long dry season or an earlier short harvest.

There is considerable sickness during and after the rains; but many of the merchants, finding that their business makes but light demands upon them during that season, are in the habit of passing in England the worst months of the year.

So long, therefore, as Bathurst remains the seat of trade, it is necessary for its convenience that the custom-house and other public offices connected with it should not be removed from its neighbourhood.\n\nOne cause of the unhealthiness of Bathurst is the existence in the immediate neighbourhood of the town of an offensive and pestilent swamp; but from a recent report of Major Clarke, R.E., it appears that, for the sum of about 7,000£, the whole space, covering nearly 1,000 acres, could be closely and efficiently drained.

Convicts, like any one else without the necessary qualification to perform works of public importance, may be of use in patching up the streets with loose earth to be washed away in the rainy season; whereas if a few more pounds are granted to expend on really competent persons to have the drains properly kept, and the streets macadamized, not only the subsidiary, but the main object of Government would be attained.\n\n5.

The reason for this is to be found in the want of public closets. Regret is often expressed at the unhealthiness of Bathurst, which is to a great extent enhanced by the filthy habits of Mandingoes, and other aboriginal tribes who come to Bathurst for trading purposes. The erection of these closets, in various parts of the town, would lessen the unhealthiness produced by the stench emanating from the excrements and nuisances of the tribes alluded to. *Your Excellency's memorialists humbly solicit that an ordinance be passed declaring it unlawful for Jolahs, Sereres, and others to walk the streets stark naked.*\n\n9.

We hope the influence of that health-giving wind will be felt at other parts of the Coast. Its absence last year was deeply deplored at Lagos, where small-pox and other fatal diseases then prevailed. But although the pestilence has been killed for a time at Bathurst by the Harmattan, we hope the present safety will not renew the guilty official apathy; and that the lives of the inhabitants will be deemed of more value than a few hundreds of pounds, more or less, in the Treasury. We say advisedly, guilty official apathy. Look at paragraphs in a letter from Bathurst in our last month\'s paper, page 2: ""The streets and drains are very dirty, the effluvia from the latter very bad; the native yards in a filthy state; and though we pay local rates of 400l. a year, and there is a surplus now in the Treasury of 6,000l., yet not a penny can or will be spared for sanitary measures, because Mr. Bauer"" (the Colonial Engineer) ""will not act;"" and yet we are face to face with a most sickly season; fever fast approaching to an epidemic in virulence; deaths are rapid and numerous, natives as well as Europeans. Still nothing is done!"" Our correspondent goes on to say that some months ago, ""We sent a petition to the Colonial Secretary, complaining of the inefficiency of the Engineer Department, asked for a Board of Inquiry, and engaged to substantiate all our charges. Dr. Gouldsbury"" (the Administrator, who is a most intimate friend of Mr. Bauer and his family) ""wrote to Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, to the effect that our statements were false; our complaints personal feeling; that Mr. Bauer was a \'most zealous and efficient officer,\' &c. The Colonial Secretary wrote back to us to the effect that, in view of the Governor\'s report, he gave no credence to our statements, and would not grant any inquiry."" In other words, the memorialists of Bathurst had the lie given to them, in the same way that it was also given to those of Sierra Leone; in both cases upon the mere ipse dixit of the erring Governor. Alas! what a commentary on all this is the fearful mortality that has plunged Bathurst into wailing, lamentation, and woe; a mortality distinctly traceable to Engineering and Administrative favouritism and incapacity or heartless indifference. Do not these events furnish a startling proof of the necessity of combined action on the West Coast, that all the settlements and populations, European merchants as well as natives, should have our constant help to bring their wants and just complaints in such a way before Her Majesty\'s Government, that it shall not be in the power of erring officials, however high their grade, to call down Imperial insult on an injured people; and obstruct the course of reforms on which the lives of the inhabitants and the prosperity of the Settlement depend?', 'last_edit_date': '1879-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1879#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Cholera at Bathurst—Fearful Ravages', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""It is with deep emotion that we have read the accounts sent to us by the bi-monthly mail from the River Gambia. The cholera, which at the date of our previous advices seemed to have relaxed a little in its severity, had broken out again with augmented vigour, and the deaths at Bathurst were on the average of 60 to 70 to 90 a-day. Out of the small population of Bathurst no less than 1,100 had already fallen victims to this fearful malady, which the African constitution, unaided, seems to have no power to resist. In the majority of cases death ensues within five or six hours. There seems to be one universal voice of condemnation as regards the official conduct of the Administrator. If ever there was an occasion when public revenue derived from Customs' duties (as they are here) ought to be unsparingly applied to arrest the progress of disease and alleviate the sufferings of a people, surely this was one; but although we see by the estimates that this small colony can afford, or is made to afford, nearly 10,000l. a year in official salaries, the Administrator, if he has not entirely sealed up the colonial chest against the demands of suffering humanity, has at least only allowed assistance in such driblets, and in so inefficient a manner, that no small share of the frightful mortality is charged openly against him by all classes of persons in the colony, from the European merchant down to the meanest native. Experience everywhere, as Admiral Patey must have well known, has established the efficacy of preventive measures in arresting the course of Asiatic cholera, provided those measures are of the right kind, and are vigorously and unsparingly applied; but little or nothing, so far as we can learn, seems to have been done by him to prevent the invasion and spread of this disease at Bathurst. The culpable parsimony and inefficiency of one man have thus brought disease and a horrible death into the homes of hundreds. Hitherto we do not hear that any European has died in Bathurst of this fell disease, but many were suffering under premonitory symptoms. The medical men in the colony (Dr. Jeans and Waters) seem to be doing their duty; we were prepared to expect this by their straightforward conduct in the Gordon case, which has no doubt brought down upon them the official ire. Dr. J. Africanus Horton, S.A.S., has, we hear from Cape Coast, been ordered up to Bathurst, and we know that he will not be found wanting in humanity or zeal. His eminent services in the Grobobo Expedition and Ashantee War, which never received any reward, are a guarantee of this."", 'last_edit_date': '1869-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1869#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Bathurst Complaints', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We are indeed pained to learn, from the Memorial addressed by some of the native inhabitants of Bathurst to the Governor-General at Sierra Leone, that the injudicious and dangerous economy and neglect which we have in other years exposed continues at this town on the Gambia. This indifference and neglect, which we feel justified in designating criminal, not only interferes with the progress of civilization, but subjects the community, both European and native, to renewed outbreaks of those destroying pestilences which have from time to time decimated the town of Bathurst. Year after year the educated native inhabitants, as well as Europeans, have protested against the continued permission by the authorities to the natives from the river villages who flock to Bathurst for trade, to perambulate the town in a state of nudity, and perform all the operations of nature when and where they choose, without the slightest regard to decency, and in defiance of all sanitary regulations which ought to be enforced in any town under British rule and law. We are at a loss to understand why such things should be—why British officials should continue to tolerate them, as if a decree had gone forth that it was not desirable that the blessings of civilization should extend in Africa. Bathurst, and all other towns on the Coast under British government, ought to be brought fully under civilized regulations, and become spots from which civilization should radiate into the neighbouring territories. That they should not be this, is a gross neglect of duty on the part of the authorities, and reflects deep disgrace on Great Britain. It is absurd to suppose that there could be any real difficulty in insisting upon public decency within the town of Bathurst. While the unclothed natives from the river villages are allowed to come into the town in their unclothed condition, and treat the town in every way as if it were the bush or fields in which they reside, they will no doubt continue to do so, and look with ignorant and barbarous contempt upon the inhabitants who are not permitted, and would no longer permit themselves, the offensive freedom from all self-restraint which they, the ""untutored savages,"" enjoy. Is it too much to expect that British authority will now at last interfere on the side of decency and health? The ""untutored savage"" would not forego the substantial benefits he or she derives from his or her visits to Bathurst because compelled to wear a proper cloth and conform to certain sanitary regulations; and, accustomed to these self-restraints within the town of Bathurst, they will thus have entered, however superficially, into the arena of civilization, and become more accessible to the propaganda of civilization among themselves. Important, however, as this change for which we call would really prove to be, it is but secondary when viewed in connection with that continued neglect of the drains, and that continuous horrible condition of the place of sepulture, respecting which the Memorialists protest. Everyone who has watched and recorded the ravages of epidemics on the West Coast of Africa must remember but too well the awful visitations to which Bathurst has been subject. Only last year it was threatened with one of them, and not a few persons perished from its advancing breath, when, happily, a sudden meteorological change drove back the fearful enemy. In some of our letters we find fears expressed that the present season may be rather an unhealthy one on the West Coast, and the mere suspicion that it will be so ought to induce precaution on the part of individuals and authorities. The latter are to a certain extent answerable for the lives of the population over whom they rule; they are fully answerable to the extent of removable causes; and among removable causes, that of pestilential drains, of filthy thoroughfares, and of graveyards in which the decaying dead are exposed to public view, filling the atmosphere with poisonous gases, must certainly be included. By the time this number of our journal reaches Bathurst the fiend of pestilence may—though we fervently pray it will not—may, we say, be upon the town. Should such, unhappily, be the case—should there be a new holocaust of victims offered up on the shrine of official incompetency, indifference, or neglect,—we shall cry loudly for retribution on those who shall have thus trifled with the lives of a community, to protect and defend which is one of the most sacred of the duties with which they are charged.', 'last_edit_date': '1880-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1880#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE CONDITION OF THE GAMBIA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '5. Although rates are regularly levied for the purpose of repairing drains and making other local improvements in Bathurst, and the attention of the Administration has been repeatedly directed to this subject, yet the sanitation of the town is in a most neglected condition, and Half Die and Newtown, the most unhealthy localities, left to take care of themselves. In the rainy season, the town is generally inundated from want of responsible persons to take care of the Sluice Gates, causing great loss and damage to property. The Colonial Engineer, whom the Colony pays £550 a year, is always on leave during the rains, when his presence is most needed to study the condition of the place.\n\n6. An Ordinance to repeal the Trade License Ordinance, 1893, and to make other provisions in lieu thereof, was passed at the Legislative Council held on the 18th ult. The provisions of the Ordinance in question are one-sided, and, above all, unconstitutional. The Colony is dependent for its prosperity on the trade carried on in the Rivers. Local taxes as such cannot bring a Revenue, and when the Administration under the pretext of protecting the large mercantile houses, which are well able to take care of themselves, from being defrauded by their traders, restricts liberty of commerce in the rivers and renders it possible for licenses to be arbitrarily refused to applicants for the same, it deals a fatal blow to the prosperity of the Colony whose resources, as it is well known, are very limited. Section 4 of the Ordinance reads as follows:—\n\n""That it shall be lawful for the Colonial Treasurer or any such Commissioner to refuse to issue a license to any applicant, unless such applicant shall first produce a certificate signed by a member of either the Executive or Legislative Council and by two Justices of the Peace that he is of good character and a fit and proper person to be entrusted with such license.""\n\nThe chief objection to this section is that it is unconstitutional, and interferes arbitrarily with the liberties of a British subject. It also opens a wide field for abuse, and practically places the liberties of the entire trading community in the hands of three unofficial members of the Executive or Legislative Council who are themselves merchants. All men are human, business men not excepted; and would it not be a source of temptation for men wielding such a power to place obstacles in the way of their fellow competitors, the other mercantile firms and small business houses? The section providing for the revocation of licenses is also impolitic. It follows that all traders who cannot obtain a license, or whose licenses may be revoked, will be obliged to flock at Bathurst to become a source of danger to the community, as all unemployed necessarily are under the pressure of want and distress.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1895#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Pestilential Swamps at Bathurst—Remedy', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—The interest which you take in the agricultural progress of Her Majesty’s settlements on the West Coast of Africa induces me to trouble you with the result of experiments made with the sunflower.\n\nBathurst, January 7, 1868.\n\nMemorandum of the weights of different kinds of sunflower seed cultivated by myself—viz.:\n\n- Macrophyllus gigantea, single large flower 25lbs. 29lbs.\n- Helianthus, or common sunflower—black seed bushel. bushel.\n- Mixed, but mostly white and grey: 36lbs. 41lbs.\n- 37lbs. 43lbs.\n\nThe above seed was grown at Bathurst, partly in a garden that had been manured, and partly in the Government paddock, a sandy patch opposite the sea, and full of weeds.\n\nCommon sunflower, mixed, black, white, and grey seed, grown in the Upper River, above McCarthy’s Island—a first experiment as a field crop there:—\n\n- Striked bushel.

Here, then, lies the possible remedy or check to the dreadful fever from which the Gambia suffers, and which mostly prevail during the rainy season, when the wind usually blows from W. to S.W. over the swamps at the back of the town of Bathurst, wafting their deadly influence into our midst.\n\nUnless this can be prevented, all the attention that could possibly be paid to the state of the town drains would be of little avail. We must strike at the root of the evil, and while doing so in the manner suggested—for a system of perfect drainage of these pestilent swamps would be attended with an enormous outlay at the beginning, and a never-ending expense for keeping it in repair, owing to the sandy nature of the soil, and the island being in many places below the level of the sea, with very doubtful results—the yield of sunflower seed would prove a valuable return for the annual expense of planting.

I made another trip in July, 1864, during a season which all ground-nut traders called good, as the rains were plentiful, and there was every prospect of a good crop. I was surprised to see large and well-regulated drains made or making in almost every part where I went, walled on either side with stone or bricks—running from one side of the town to the other, and emptying into the sea. A great many were in an imperfect state, some of which were interrupted by the approach of the rainy season.\n\nIt was pleasant to see fine squares in the middle of the town, all covered with the green Bahama grass, and some of the drains supplied with railings. It struck me at once that there was a wonderful change in the interior of Bathurst since I last had seen it. There were good bridges in the centres of the streets, where in 1855 I had to walk knee deep in water. There was no more an inundation from the muddy swamp at the back and left of the town, a proper sea embankment having been made by the present Governor, which led to the securing of a large tract of land from the water. This land has been a great source of revenue to the Colonial Government, as it was afterwards divided into lots, and sold at a very advantageous rate, bringing over 600l. to the colonial coffers. The road to the burial-ground, which was in a fearful state of swamp, and in many parts covered over with water, is now converted into a hard road, and forms a pleasurable walk.\n\nAt this visit I rode to the cape. It is a distance of about seven miles. The road from St. Mary's to the ferry was excellent and hard—a good carriage drive. The boat employed in the ferry is an antiquated piece of workmanship, perhaps about fifty or a hundred years old, of an American origin, equally broad in stern and bow, and worked by paddles manned by four men. Sometimes the boat is drifted about 300 yards beyond its landing-place. I have never seen such an ugly piece of mechanism, and it is tiresome to see the poor men labouring to make this huge log move; and although it is said that the colony is in a state of bankruptcy, I hope they will soon be able to replace it with something more modern and workable. The road from the ferry to the cape is partly good and partly bad, the latter portion being rapidly repairing by the civilian prisoners. The material used by the Governor is the shell of the common cockle, mixed with those of other gregarious mollusks.\n\nAll along the road are large Bombax, or monkey bread trees, and I noticed hollows scraped out of a great many of them; and on inquiry I was told that they were so ordered to be done by the Governor, to form rests for the women who carry loads on their heads."", 'last_edit_date': '1865-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1865#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Horrible and Dangerous State of Cape Coast after Forty Years of British Rule', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We have already endeavoured to direct the notice of the authorities to the abominable condition of the streets, lanes, and gutters of this town.
