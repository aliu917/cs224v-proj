169,"The establishment of medical education for Africans, such as a medical school in Sierra Leone, is essential for regional development, public health improvement, and challenging contemporary anthropological theories, while also addressing the complex dynamics between European and African contributions to healthcare.","The observations from both the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the significance of establishing medical education for Africans, particularly in Sierra Leone, as a catalyst for regional development and public health improvement. The textbook highlights the emergence of an educated elite in West Africa, with figures like James Africanus Horton, who trained in Britain, playing pivotal roles in advancing regional development and healthcare. This supports the claim that medical education was crucial for these areas. It also touches on the role of medical missionaries, including Africans, in healthcare, reflecting the complex dynamics between European and African contributions, though it does not specifically mention a medical school in Sierra Leone or directly challenge contemporary anthropological theories. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize the necessity of training native Africans in medicine to tackle public health challenges like yellow fever and discuss the potential establishment of a medical school in Sierra Leone. They highlight the importance of qualified African medical professionals in saving lives and reducing costs, while also challenging anthropological theories by showcasing African capabilities in significant roles. However, the articles provide less direct commentary on the interplay between European and African healthcare contributions. Together, these sources affirm the essential role of medical education in public health and regional development, while also addressing the need to challenge prevailing anthropological views, albeit with varying emphasis on the dynamics between European and African contributions.","The paragraphs from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook provide several insights related to the claim about the establishment of medical education for Africans.

Indeed, it was the Creoles, as the educated people of Sierra Leone came to be called, who pioneered most of the missionary and educational activities in the other parts of West Africa. Three typical examples were James Africanus Horton who was born in 1835 in Sierra Leone, trained in Britain as a doctor from 1853 to 1859 and entered the West African Medical Service as a Staff Assistant Surgeon; Samuel Ajayi Crowther who was one of the first products of Fourah Bay College and the first African to be ordained as a Bishop of the Anglican Church; and James Johnson, that fiery intellectual and evangel¬ ist.28 Others included Broughton Davies, who qualified as a doctor in 1859, and Samuel Lewis, the lawyer, the first African to receive a knighthood.29 Liberia also produced a few intellectuals, among whom was Edward Wilmot Blyden, who was born in the West Indies. Slightly larger were the numbers in Nigeria and the Gold Coast. In Nigeria, the elite included people like Essien Ukpabio, D. B. Vincent (later known as Mojóla Agbebi), H. E. Macaulay, G. W. Johnson, R. B. Blaize and J. A. Otunba Payne.30 The Gold Coast elite of the 1870s and 1880s included J. A. Solomon, E.J. Fynn, J. P. Brown, J. de Graft Hayford, A. W. Parker, T. Laing, J. H. Brew and John Mensah Sarbah.31', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""In tropical Africa governmental medicine was long a military concern although small civilian hospitals began to appear in the 1890s. From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi. It was not until after the Second World War that technical schools and univer› sity colleges were established in most parts of Africa. And significantly, only one university college each was established in the Gold Coast in 1947, in Nigeria in 1948, in Uganda in 1950, in Senegal and Madagascar in 1950, in Salisbury in 1953, in Congo Leopoldville in 1954 and Elizabethville in 1956.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm, Ascaris infections, schistosomiasis, filariasis and Guinea worm. To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease. Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively. Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s. Nevertheless, tropical medical schools were established in Europe as early as 1897 in Liverpool and London, 1900 in Hamburg, 1901 in Brussels, followed later by Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles, and in Africa by 1912 in Cape Town and 1918 in Dakar."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.631, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Economic and social change in Liberia and Ethiopia, 1915-35 > Ethiopia', 'content': 'the medical field, mainly by missionaries, notably the United Presbyterian Church of North America, the Seventh Adventist Mission, and the Italian Catholic Mission, all of which operated hospitals in Addis Ababa, while the Sudan Interior Mission ran a leprosarium at Akaki.$^{75}$ Other developments included the creation of a small civil service, partly formed with students returning from abroad, which received salaries instead of the revenues from fiefs, and the increasing replacement of tribute in kind by taxes in cash. A decree to curtail labour services from the peasant was enacted in 1934, and legislation for the reform of the land tax in 1935. Efforts at modernization were, however, by then overshadowed by the impending threat of Italian Fascist invasion. 76 Thus the period between 1915 and 1935 witnessed a wider spread and a greater degree of economic and social change in Liberia and Ethiopia than before. However, this change did not amount to much and both countries therefore remained economically backward and socially undevel› oped. Finally, investment by foreign nationals and firms in commercial, agricultural and mining enterprises was greater in Liberia than in Ethiopia; and while it aided the processes of modernization, it also led to greater foreign control of the Liberian economy than was the case in Ethiopia.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'The neglect of technical and industrial education and the emphasis on liberal and clerical training and the consequent love for white-collar jobs also created among the educated folk disdain for manual labour and agricul› tural work which is still with us. Furthermore, the uneven nature of the distribution of educational facilities prevented a uniform process of modernization in each colony, which further accentuated differences and tensions between ethnic groups and regions. These have remained in many areas and underlie some of the civil wars and rivalries that have occurred in some independent African states. The neglect of higher education and technical training also compelled some Africans who could afford to do so, to send their children to the metropolitan countries as well as to the United States, and it was such people who, partly from their varying experiences of racial discrimination and, even more important still, their deeper appreciation of the evil nature of the colonial system, became on their return, as will be shown in the next volume, the most bitter critics of the system and the leaders of the anti-colonial or nationalist movements.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'New political trends', 'content': 'In West Africa, two completely new states, the products of the humani› tarian, abolitionist and racist campaigns of the period, Sierra Leone and Liberia, were also formed in 1787 and 1820 respectively, while Libreville was founded in Equatorial Africa.

The much-heralded black emigration schemes trumpeted by Garvey, whose ubiquitous publications reached deep into Africa, were only one example of a leitmotif which brought American blacks within the world view of African peoples. The themes of African redemption through American black missionaries were another.\nAfricans themselves, however, created the context of their next interaction with American blacks as they matriculated at American, largely Afro-American, schools and attended pan-African conferences and the like. Consequently, many Africans underwent a technical-educationalpolitical experience alien to their colonial world. When they re-entered their own worlds, many felt driven to resolve questions of ideology, cultural definition, educational values, political power, and pan-African unity or consciousness, guided by new perspectives.\nViewed against such an historical backdrop, the numerous pan-African conferences, Tuskegean educational and technical projects, the nØgritude movement and the occasional focus on American blacks in African millen› nial dreams, all illustrate the consistency of the pan-African theme among American and Caribbean blacks. They also show the variability of African responses to the New World overtures and ultimately the shaping by Africans themselves of these overtures to fit African specifications.\nIn sum, the populations of the African diaspora and the motive charac› terizing the many interactions between persons of the first and second black worlds included two visions. One was a vision of the union of religious forces among black populations in Africa and America or the reconstruction of Africa through importation of American and Antillean black technical expertise, initiated at the behest of American blacks. Another reflected the transformation of Africans from predicate to subject during the colonial period. The latter was a vision of the spiritual redemption, social recon› struction, and political reformation of African communities through the repatriation of African personnel and the energizing of African resources. Because of this vision, Africans had been educated in American schools, or sent to participate in technical and commercial activities; others were touched by American black writings or by anti-colonial ventures organized among blacks of the diaspora.

For not only is the time of service on that coast doubly reckoned, but they enjoy besides the substantial advantage of private practice. This advantage they do not enjoy in the West Indies, private practice being in the hands of the civil medical practitioners. That the emoluments from this source are considerable, may be judged of by the fact that the late colonial surgeon of Sierra Leone is understood to have realised the handsome sum of 20,000l., and the yearly income of the present colonial surgeon of that colony from official and private practice is, as has been stated by himself and friends, 1,200l. or 1,500l. per annum. We are glad, therefore, to know that some of the native gentlemen are educating their sons to the medical profession. A beginning has been made in this direction, Messrs. Smith and Spilsberry being far advanced medical students at King's College, and the appointment to staff-assistant-surgeoncies of Drs. Davis and Horton is a proof that the Government is alive to the advantages of having coloured medical officers attached to the regiments stationed in West Africa. Strangely, however, their appointment is viewed almost as an intrusion by some of their European professional brethren on the coast, and we have heard it rumoured that one of these medical gentlemen had it even in contemplation to resign his commission rather than subject himself to the passive, but not less harassing annoyances to which he had been subjected. Be that as it may, it is of importance that every encouragement should be held out by the Government to native gentlemen who have qualified themselves to hold appointments either in the army or colonial medical service in West Africa. We are aware that against the appointment of native medical gentlemen the argument is constantly advanced, that neither Europeans nor Africans have confidence in them. This assertion we emphatically deny, and beg to record our protest against it. And if evidence were wanting of its utter groundlessness, we could, in support of our statement, triumphantly point to the late Staff Surgeon William Fergusson, a dark mulatto gentleman (afterwards Governor of Sierra Leone), in whose medical skill both Europeans and natives had unbounded confidence. To assert, therefore, that the advice of native medical officers would not be esteemed, is the flimsiest of pretences. From all we have learnt, we suspect that the true reason of the opposition offered by European medical officers on this head may be traced to their natural apprehension that the lucrative field of private practice, now in the hands of a few, would be greatly diminished when black or coloured medical gentlemen come to contest it with them."", 'last_edit_date': '1863-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1863#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SURGEONS FOR THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""In our last number we briefly remarked on the Army Medical Department having recently advertised for assistant-surgeons for service in our West African colonies.

I do not pretend to deny that the results of the missionary labour are as good as they might have been or were expected to be, nor will I deny that in a few isolated cases it would appear that the education of natives by missionaries has failed to produce the desired effect, but, on the whole, no man with reasonable expectations, or who is not extremely...\n**[AUGUST 23, 1865.]**\n\nshort-sighted, can question the beneficial results missionary efforts have produced; and sweeping assertions to the contrary, such as I have heard made, are, to say the least, unjust.

It is true that natives who have had the advantage of their instruction naturally obtain some knowledge of their own rights, not always agreeable to the purposes of Europeans, who, in but too many instances, do not find it convenient to make due concessions to men wrongfully considered their inferiors; but I personally know a great many natives educated by missionaries who are good, useful members of society, not second to their more favoured white brethren of a similar condition in European life. As to the missionaries, I know of no instance where they have not fully merited and entitled themselves to the respect and esteem of the community at large, which their peculiar calling brings forth.\n\nI now beg to make a few observations on the improvement of Sierra Leone especially, which by its influence would be very beneficial to the neighbouring coast. I am no advocate for the doctrine that civilisation in Africa can only be forwarded by foreign material interference; as it is scarcely reasonable to suppose that, in our age of stern realities, European nations are likely to expend life and wealth for a doubtful, and perhaps unproductive enterprise; but I mean to assert, and I do so in full confidence, that the germ of improvement and civilisation lies in Africa, and that Africans themselves, aided by European direction, could be the constructors of their own social improvement; which, of course, would be a question of time.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-07-31', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1865#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Bishop of Sierra Leone on the Education of the West African', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In his book, ""Sierra Leone after a Hundred Years"" (Seeley & Co.), Bishop Ingham, in reviewing the work which has been accomplished in and around Sierra Leone, observes:—\n\n""It is impossible not to regret that the Church Missionary Society were unable to develop in the schools of the Colony some accurate knowledge of manual trades. The results in aptitude for interior missionary work, in energy, perseverance, and common sense, would have been enormous. ... The other plan (abstract teaching, divorced from material business) has been abundantly tried, and what is the result? Not only does the constant hammering at the brain, of which this raw (negro) youth must now become a victim, produce an unbalanced development, but the precocious memory that will characterise him is a deceptive gauge of progress made, and, like much precociousness elsewhere, the results are disappointing in after life. For this reason, a successfully-passed examination on paper is not the test in Africa that it is in England. ... Can we be surprised that the very last thing he (the negro young man) thinks of is the development of his country or making his father\'s village better than he found it—and thus his want of accuracy, want of perseverance and skill, and all that goes to make a man master of any situation, remain uncorrected, and put him altogether out of the running. We are convinced that there is a more excellent way, and we regret it has not more generally approved itself to those who have done such good work in other respects in this part of Africa.

There was a settlement there before the British Government commenced its crusade against the traffic in human beings, but the population was very small, and the colony had a precarious existence until it was placed under the control of the African Institution, an organization established for the improvement of the western part of Africa. This body, which had the support of all the great men engaged in the anti-slavery movement in England, directed its efforts to the amelioration of the condition of the freed slaves, and did in its time an immense amount of good. Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, was made the head-quarters of the association on the coast, and the captured slaves were landed and settled there. An idea of the extent to which this kind of colonization was carried may be gathered from the fact that the total number of slaves emancipated at Sierra Leone between June, 1819, and January, 1833, was 27,697. The exertions of the association were not merely directed to the settlement of the slaves. A system of education was inaugurated, and the settlers were trained in useful arts. The funds of the association were not always well employed, but the general result of their operations is highly satisfactory, and such as to reflect high honour upon the benevolence of the English people. Sierra Leone is now a flourishing colony, and its inhabitants are further advanced on the paths of civilization than, perhaps, any other body of Africans. Education is widely diffused amongst the community, and many of the higher classes have obtained academic distinction in England, and risen to positions of eminence in their own country.

There is no wealthy landed proprietary in the colony, themselves acquainted practically with agricultural industry, who might, and would, if they existed, initiate efforts and experiments for developing the resources of the soil. As Christian civilization had to be introduced from Europe, so must the impulse to agricultural industry be introduced from Europe also. The ""germ of improvement and civilization"" now ""lies,"" as Mr. Rosenbush most truly says, ""in Africa, and Africans themselves, aided by European direction, could be the constructors of their own social improvement.""

I had heard and read so much of its unhealthiness that I had pictured to myself a low-lying swampy coast, fringed with mangrove bushes, and with the other accompaniments of a malarial climate. This imaginary sketch bore not the slightest resemblance to the truth. In the place of a flat, low-lying district I found a mountainous tract of country, formed by two rivers which nearly intersect it. The general appearance of this Sierra is picturesque in the extreme. The sky line is broken by the irregular outline of a number of conical peaks, covered to their summits with lofty forests, which give to the distant scenery a rich and romantic appearance. Freetown is situated on the shore of a beautiful bay, hemmed in by a grand amphitheatre of hills, covered with vegetation. The distance between the town and the base of the mountains varies from three-quarters of a mile to a mile and a half, the intervening space being broken by numerous grass-clad undulations.\n\nHills ascend almost in regular gradation until they reach the highest peak, and as they are well wooded, the *coup d'œil* is striking and beautiful. A fairer situation for a town can scarcely be imagined, and if the sad experience of the past did not teach us the contrary, it would be pronounced healthy. There is no room to doubt, however, that Sierra Leone is extremely unhealthy, and epidemics of fever occur from time to time which sweep off large numbers of the population. This fever is peculiarly deadly to Europeans, and at the time when there was a European garrison the mortality was immense, whole families being occasionally carried off during one visitation. Happily, few Europeans are now sent to this deadly climate, and the number is yearly decreasing. At the census of 1881 there were only 160 resident whites in the whole of Sierra Leone.

To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease. Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively. Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s. Nevertheless, tropical medical schools were established in Europe as early as 1897 in Liverpool and London, 1900 in Hamburg, 1901 in Brussels, followed later by Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles, and in Africa by 1912 in Cape Town and 1918 in Dakar."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""In tropical Africa governmental medicine was long a military concern although small civilian hospitals began to appear in the 1890s. From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo* Basin and Angola', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The area with which we are concerned is broadly bounded by the Atlantic coast on the west, Lake Tanganyika and the Nile-Zaire ridge on the east, the Ubangui savannas on the north, and the plateau separating the Zaire and Zambezi basins to the south.

Contrary to the common belief, the history of the years 1800-80 is not a matter only or mainly of long-distance trade and links with the outside world (the economy of Central African communities at this period was still based more on production than on trade). Nor can the precolonial nineteenth century be regarded as an era of widespread violence, because of the slave trade, civil strife, etc.: the commonplace belief that Africa was racked by incessant 'tribal warfare' overlooks the basic fact that the bulk of the peoples in the area led peaceful lives as producers, steadily improving their farming methods, bettering their environment and exporting the produce of food-gathering. Finally, the history of the nineteenth century is not to be reduced to purely political history concerned with despotic kingdoms and states: if there is a political feature common to the Central African communities of the period around 1800, it is more likely to be the much disputed quest for equilibrium and accommodation between powers derived from different sources.\nAn historical account of nineteenth-century Central Africa must in fact satisfy several requirements. It must describe the ordinary life and aspirations of the societies in this enormous area at the time. This would bring out the continuity between the 1800s and the more distant past: the changes, although noticeable, were slow.\nAt the same time, the history of Central Africa in the nineteenth century is characterized by breaks with the past. After all, in the years 1800-80 the area was more a part of the world trading network than ever before. The impact of the world economic situation, or of some specific sectors of it, was making itself felt: in some areas it influenced social and political history, giving a noticeable impetus to trade and offering new opportunities for stockpiling, while in others it restricted the process.

Around the turn of the century Barue, Tawara, Tonga and other Shona religious spirit mediums (svikiro) (see Fig. 8.1) provided divinely inspired medicines to neutralize the European weapons and turn their bullets into water. 10 Despite the common commitment of some of the Africans to prevent foreign rule and to acquire modern weapons, the immediate tactics they employed varied substantially.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered.

Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Agricultural systems', 'content': ""causal effect of the external trade should not be exaggerated. As J. L. Vellut has emphasized, the nineteenth century was not just 'the history of the ebb and flow of the world economy as experienced by ... Africa', but also 'the slow-moving ... history of diversification in making use of natural resources.'$^{20}$ It is essential to emphasize this internal factor on which the external came to impinge and which shaped the response of African peoples to the external factors. As Cohen has shown in his chapter on the Great Lakes region hitherto studied only as a collection of centralized states responding to external forces - 'the nineteenth century was not simply a world of states, large and small. It was also a world in which individuals and households were in innumerable small, sometimes undramatic ways, altering their orientations to state authority, to service, to production, and to the market.' 21 The agricultural system around the ancient city of Kano in northern Nigeria at the beginning of the nineteenth century provides interesting similarities and contrasts with the world of Bunafu in the 'unadministered zone' of northern Busoga. For one thing, the market played a stronger role in the economy, since Kano was a well-established centre of local, regional and international trade based in part on major and highly successful industrial activity in the manufacture, dyeing and distribution of textiles, and the tanning of leather. Yet it would be misleading to concentrate on the channel effects of the markets and trade routes and to ignore the network of social and cultural relations on which the markets and the trade routes depended. Similarly, in Kano, there was the influence of Islam, and the much greater role of the ruler and the ruling class and merchants of the walled city in the management of the economy. And yet in Kano, as in Bunafu and the village communities of Tunisia, the bulk of agricultural production not only of basic essentials but also of a variety of cottons and dyes was in the hands of commoners in the rural areas among whom the household was the unit of production. As Abdulahi Mahadi has observed in a recent study, the head of a household in the Kano area, the maigida, was 'like a ruler of a town'.

Fortunately, other volumes of the Unesco General History have already dealt with the dynamics of change in Africa in the earlier periods. The 'myth' of static Africa has thus already been exploded.

It is more likely that, as in the djikàd states, the seeds of collapse came from internal discontent and yearning for reform, and the actual collapse owed more to the penetration of Islamic ideas and the direct impact of the Sokoto djihad than to the slave trade and/or abolition. The consequent wars, population movements, colonization of new areas hitherto regarded as marginal such as the coastal swamps, the rise of new towns and markets, and the spirit of reform and experimentation, created new opportunities that the Europeans came to exploit rather than to set in motion.\nThis groping for renewal, then, will explain why so many African rulers in the course of the nineteenth century from Egypt and Tunisia to Madagascar and Lesotho, Abeokuta and Fanteland, suspicious as they were of European intentions, nevertheless risked cautious collaboration with European traders, adventurers or missionaries as a way of importing European technology to assist their work of development. It was not only Egypt that experienced a sense of renaissance. The nineteenth century may well be called the 'African Age of Improvement',$^{30}$ in which the urge for improvement dominated the scene, but the urge came from within. The rulers tried to exploit increased European activities to achieve improvement but were to end up being exploited and frustrated in the search for renaissance."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Again various societies had had different levels of contact with Europeans or Arabs, the two external forces impinging on East Africa at this time. On the whole, coastal areas had had a longer contact with Europeans and Arabs than the interior areas. Of the interior peoples, three or four groups had had longer contact with the Arabs than the rest. The Akamba in Kenya and the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika were involved in the caravan trade from the interior to the coast - a phenomenon often referred to as long-distance trade.$^{5}$ The Baganda as well as the Wanga in Kenya had also had contact with Arabs trading in ivory and slaves prior to the 1890s. Again the degree of exposure to these outside influences determined the type and extent of resistance put up by various societies.\nApart from these human influences, there were ecological changes taking place in East Africa in the 1890s, which also affected response to foreign penetration. The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all. A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya. This was especially the case against the Nandi.$^{9}$ The Maasai example serves to illustrate the kind of dislocation that had taken place among the economies of various societies in this general area.

A decree to curtail labour services from the peasant was enacted in 1934, and legislation for the reform of the land tax in 1935. Efforts at modernization were, however, by then overshadowed by the impending threat of Italian Fascist invasion. 76 Thus the period between 1915 and 1935 witnessed a wider spread and a greater degree of economic and social change in Liberia and Ethiopia than before. However, this change did not amount to much and both countries therefore remained economically backward and socially undevel› oped.

The Esza people of Abakaliki Division, the Uzuakoli and the Aro may be cited as examples.$^{6}$ Some cults were clearly a focus for resistance to colonial rule, such as the Mwari in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), or secret associations like the Poro in Sierra Leone and other parts of West Africa. War-charm movements also occurred in Madagascar and the Congo basin. In East Africa, especially Kenya, African prophets arose to provide spiritual reinvigoration$^{7}$ to resist colonialism, such as occurred in the Machakos District among the people of Kilungu in the early months of 1922 (see Chapter 26). One of the best-known movements which used both religion and magic to resist colonial rule and oppression was the Majï Majï movement in German East Africa during the first decade of the twen› tieth century.$^{8}$ (See Fig. 7.1.) Even though the movement failed, it served as a demonstration of the fact that unity could be achieved in African traditional religion in the face of European pressure and that African traditional religion was not a fragmentary force confined to limited localities.

Largely because of the writings of the djihad leaders and European travellers, we know enough about the complex of forces and ideas that produced the series of revolutionary movements starting from Futa Toro, Futa Jallon and Bondu in the eighteenth century and stretching to the Sokoto, Massina and Dinguiraye djihäds in the nineteenth. We therefore do not need to speculate about the possible contribution to that complex of forces and ideas of European mercantilist influence in the days of the slave trade or capitalist influence in the days of abolition and journeys of discovery. The initiative for the djihäd movements came from within. The djihäd states took a great interest in promoting agriculture, partly through traditional household production, partly also through estates worked by slave or client labour. They also promoted industrial manufacture and trade. They improved trade routes and offered protection to traders and merchants. By far the greatest portion of the traffic on the routes was for local and regional exchange. But the djihad leaders also promoted trans-Saharan trade routes and the pilgrimage route to the Eastern Sudan, the Nile Valley and Mecca. Evidence is building up that these internal trading initiatives had developed trade routes that permitted trans-continental traffic before the new European trade of the nineteenth century.$^{28}$ The Europeans, of course, were quick to note the results of these internal initiatives and were attracted to the possibility of profiting from them.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.621, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Introduction', 'content': 'The djihäd movements of Islamic reformation covered the whole of the Sudanic zone of West Africa, and the eastern Sahara up to Cyrenaica, and spread south to the borders of the forest region as their impact reached Senegambia and the Voltaic regions, the southern Mandinka, northern Yoruba and the Edo-speaking peoples. As the European demand for palm oil, peanuts, ivory, sisal and rubber grew and the internal network of long› distance trade routes responded to these demands, trade became a major factor affecting access to firearms and the acquisition of wealth, and hence the rise and fall of states over wide areas of Africa. As a consequence of this expanding European trade and the activities of European and American missionaries, Christianity and European ideas of social and political organ› ization also became factors of change over a wide area stretching from Sierra Leone to Southern Africa and Madagascar.\nWhat stands out most prominently in these different movements is the efforts of various African leaders in the nineteenth century in different parts of the continent to reform their societies. Some of the efforts were inspired by the heritage of cultures in Africa, others by reformist ideas in Islam. In most cases, the leaders were only too ready to take advantage of opportunities offered by the expanding scope of trade and the activities of Europeans, whether traders or missionaries, hunters of game or hunters of concessions. Another feature that stands out just as prominently was how these efforts of African leaders to reform were systematically being undermined by the very activities of European traders, missionaries and hunters that African leaders tried to exploit.\nIt is remarkable how little attention so far has been paid to this feature of the nineteenth century: of internal efforts at reform systematically being aborted by external intervention. Because of the assumption that colonialism and integration into the world economy were necessary con› ditions of modernization, most historians have failed to notice how much the nineteenth century represented an African effort at self-development and to what extent European conquest and colonialism was a subversion of that effort.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'African traditional religion and colonial rule', 'content': ""Another cult similar to Majï Majï was the Nyabingi cult, which also covered a wide area and cut across ethnic and regional boundaries and was found in Ruanda (now Rwanda), north-western Tanganyika (now Tanzania) and Uganda. Like the followers of Majï Majï its adherents believed that the power of its medicines could neutralize the effect of European bullets, as well as believing in possession by the spirits of legendary ancestors. It began during the late nineteenth century and gathered momentum until it finally broke out in 1928 in revolt against European occupation in the Kigezi region of Uganda. (See Fig. 7.1.) As E. Hopkins put it, 'the movement succeeded in immobilizing the admini› strative efforts of three colonial powers for nearly two decades until its final suppression in 1928'.$^{9}$ The Germans, and the Belgians who took over Ruanda from them after the First World War, failed to suppress it, and even after the suppression of the 1928 uprising, the cult lingered on until it was finally suppressed in 1934.\nOther cults gathered force against the European pressure by reviving aspects of traditional religion and combining them with ideas borrowed from Christianity.

Indeed, so far from that being the case, quinine with calomel was used by myself and other medical officers stationed in the West African colonies many years anterior to 1850, the time Dr. Livingstone states he had first tried the formula he recommends. Perhaps quinine with calomel may not have been combined with the resin of jalap, as he prescribes; but be that as it may, the practice of giving quinine with calomel had been long used with success at the commencement of the remittent fevers of West Africa, and they were so given either with or without the addition of powdered, not resinous, jalap, as might be deemed best. For example, ten grains of quinine, with an equal quantity of calomel and jalap, were given to a strong adult; the dose being of course regulated by the age and strength of the patient. I have, over and over again, witnessed the almost marvellous good effects that soon followed their exhibition. Even in the worst cases, those of destitute British and Foreign European seamen, who were frequently brought to hospital several days after the accession of fever, and when unmistakable typhoid symptoms had set in, recoveries took place under this treatment; relief from the distressing head and back ache generally following after copious discharges of dark foetid bilious evacuations had passed off from the bowels; the brown leathery sordes disappearing from the lips and tongue, and the skin becoming moist and comfortable. In such circumstances, and, indeed, in all cases of African fever, it is indispensable that the patient\'s strength should be assiduously supported by light, nourishing food and wine.\n\nQuinine was also given with opium, or its alkaloids in solution, or in the form of pills, when the patient was restless, to calm and subdue nervous irritability. It was also frequently given combined with the neutral salts (Epsom, &c.) and purgative and carminative tinctures, if the bowels required to be acted upon. But the chief object was to bring the patient under the influence of the quinine as quickly as possible, the warm bath, and other adjuvant remedies, being likewise used to combat symptoms as they appeared.\n\nI could say a great deal more on this subject; but trust I may have said enough to establish the fact, that Dr. Livingstone has no claim to be considered the originator of the practice of giving quinine with calomel and other purgatives, in the first stage of the paroxysmal fevers of Africa.—Your obedient servant,'}, {'id': 262, 'article_title': 'Advertisements', 'full_section_title': 'Advertisements', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1863#article-28', 'issue_date': '23_11_1863', 'content': 'CONCENTRATED ESSENCE OF PERUVIAN BARK.\nSuperior and more agreeable than Quinine, it truly contains all the elements of the Cinchona Bark, dissolved out by a peculiar process, that eliminates entirely the active principle, adding materially to its efficacy as a medical agent; being fluid, it does not pass off or through the system, as Quinine occasionally does, it is easier on the stomach, and will not produce either headache or constipation, mixes well with water, wine, or spirits, being exclusive, very important, rare and valuable properties fully appreciated by all who use it.—Sole Maker, H.

In the meantime there has been issued the official report to the Indian Government of Dr. King for the year 1879-80, regarding the cinchona cultivation and the harvesting of bark in the Government plantations in Bengal. In 1879-80 the extended cultivation reached about 750,000 young trees, and a crop of 361,590 lb. of dry bark was harvested. A new kind of cinchona yielding the Carthagena bark of commerce was successfully brought into cultivation. At the close of 1879 a consignment of Calisaya bark was made to London for sale in the market. The amount of febrifuges used in Government hospitals and dispensaries in 1879, in substitution of quinine, was 5,400 lb. The average price of quinine in Calcutta in 1879 was 9 rupees per pound, and at that figure the saving effected by the native-grown substitute has been nearly 40,000 l. The saving in former years from the like substitution of the cheap and equally effective native for the imported and costly drug was about 80,000 l., so that to the end of 1879 the total saving was about 120,000 l., or about 15,000 l. more than the plantations have cost from their origin, including compound interest on outlay at 4 per cent. per annum. These results are gratifying, and in the future even larger savings are expected from the successful cultivation of the valuable cinchona species (obtained through Kew) which yields the Carthagena or Columbian bark.\n\nWould it not be worth while for some of our friends in West Africa to enter upon the cultivation of this valuable, or rather invaluable, plant? We cannot entertain the shadow of a doubt that it would succeed on the high lands in the neighbourhood of Sierra Leone, and the industrious planters of Liberia might, we think, try their hands at it with success. The money value of a crop when obtained is so great that it would surely be worth while to make the effort. Quinine is one of the great specifics for African fever, which ought to be another inducement to cultivate the plant. We earnestly recommend that trials should be made.

It was well known that the majority of European residents on the Coast sooner or later became attacked by African fever in one form or another, and even those who merely visited the coast ran risk of being attacked, especially if they were over forty years of age, or were in a low or depressed state. They were also aware that when in the malignant form—""black water fever""—under the present method of treatment the majority of those attacked died. This melancholy state of matters was almost daily brought home to them by the loss, if not of relations or friends, at least of officials, such as captains, managers, clerks, and others. It was not to be wondered at, therefore, that they should be dissatisfied with the present mode of treatment, and inquire if it was not possible for some improvement to be inaugurated in this respect. Of course the question arose—could the method of medical practice called homœopathic effect any better results? He unhesitatingly said it could, and he spoke after an experience of 35 years in homœopathic practice, preceded by 15 years\' experience in ordinary or allopathic practice. He based this assertion on the published results of the two methods of treatment in the most severe diseases and the worst forms of malignant malarial fever. Unfortunately there were not any practitioners on the coast sufficiently familiar with the resources of homœopathy to be able to demonstrate this on the spot, but it had been shown over and over again in the malignant malarial fevers of tropical and sub-tropical America and India, where similar fevers were much the same as in the regions of Africa; and there the mortality under homœopathic treatment was not one-third that under ordinary treatment. When the mortality in yellow fever under ordinary treatment was about 70 per cent of those attacked, that under homœopathic treatment was about 20 per cent, and in mild epidemics less than 1 per cent. Moreover, statistics showed that the convalescence was much shorter and the recovery more complete. This was because the patients had not been severely drugged with quinine, calomel, or other strong poisons. He had, therefore, the greatest confidence in endeavouring to induce the African Section of the Chamber of Commerce to do its utmost to have missionaries and captains of vessels furnished with homœopathic medicines and directions, and to have homœopathic treatment introduced into the settlements on the coast. With about two dozen one-ounce bottles of homœopathic medicines and a few pages of directions, an intelligent missionary or captain would be able to effect much better results than an ordinary ship\'s doctor with the Government manual and chest of medicines, and to save many valuable lives that would otherwise be lost. It was not only in malarial fevers that the superiority of homœopathic treatment was to be seen. It was the same in dysentery, Asiatic cholera, typhus fever, sunstroke, pleurisy, pneumonia, bronchitis, and all other severe diseases. By doing their utmost to enable residents on the coast to obtain homœopathic treatment, the African Section of the Chamber would add another to the many and great services they had already rendered to Africa, and would earn the blessings of future victims of African fevers.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Covert Slavery and Slave-Trade at Lagos', 'section_title': '', 'content': '**HEALTH, TONE, AND VIGOUR.**\n\n**DR.

It highlights the role of sanitary measures, vaccines, and drugs developed in the early 20th century, suggesting that Lamplough's Pyretic Saline was not a significant factor in medical practices or mortality reduction in Africa during the 19th century. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide substantial support for the claim, citing numerous endorsements from medical professionals and officials, such as Dr. Gibbon, Dr. Sparks, and Lieutenant-Colonel Murray, who attested to the saline's efficacy in treating fevers and blood diseases. The articles also mention its use in reducing mortality rates, with references to its success in treating yellow fever in the West Indies and cholera in Coldbath-fields Prison, London, and its recommendation by the Governor of Sierra Leone. Despite these endorsements, the articles lack empirical data or scientific studies to substantiate the claims, which could be a point of interest for historians examining the broader context of medical practices during this period.","The General History of Africa textbook does not mention Lamplough's Pyretic Saline or its use as a treatment or preventative measure for tropical diseases such as yellow fever, cholera, and jungle fever in Africa during the 19th century.

To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease. Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively. Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s. Nevertheless, tropical medical schools were established in Europe as early as 1897 in Liverpool and London, 1900 in Hamburg, 1901 in Brussels, followed later by Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles, and in Africa by 1912 in Cape Town and 1918 in Dakar."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.754, 'probability_score': 0.055, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""In tropical Africa governmental medicine was long a military concern although small civilian hospitals began to appear in the 1890s. From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

The first important beneficial social effect was the overall increase of the population of Africa during the colonial period by about 37.5%, as J. C. Caldwell has shown (Chapter 18), after its decline during the first two or three decades of colonialism. This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization. As A. E. Afigbo has emphasized (Chapter 19), urban› ization was of course not unknown in pre-colonial Africa. The kingdoms and empires of Africa had such capitals or political centres as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, Gao and Great Zimbabwe; such commercial centres as Kano, Jenne, Sofala and Malindi, and such educational centres as Timbuktu, Cairo and Fez. But there is no doubt that as a result of colonial› ism, the pace of urbanization was greatly accelerated.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well. In the 1840s the impact of such measures in Algiers was particularly great as the French strove to control cholera. 47', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns against epidemic disease apparently gained some success. The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered. Yellow fever epidemics have occurred from Senegal to Sudan at unpredictable intervals. By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths. From 50 to 80 per cent have or have had syphilis or yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm,"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': 'until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

Smallpox vaccination was on such a small scale that by the late 1930s a significant reduction of the disease had probably taken place only in the Gold Coast and southern Nigeria. 93 In contrast, contact with Europeans and participation in the First World War ensured that the influenza epidemic of 1918-19 swept through Africa probably resulting in the highest annual death rate this century, although the rise in death rates was probably not as great as in Asia, for many African populations were still protected by comparative isolation. Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.73, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': ""Famines and psychological stress also left the uprooted and malnourished vulnerable to infectious diseases carried by the coastal traders. Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

The workers, carrying within themselves the great load of worms and agents of diseases commonly found in tropical Africa, worked more strenuously at times than they had learnt was possible for them, and came down with sickness.

Around the 1840s, trade that relied on the use of the western routes declined while trade by way of the routes of the central Sahara thrived, especially between Tripoli and Kano and between Tripoli and Borno. In addition, a new direct link between Wadaïand Barka, discovered in 1809 or 18 10, became a major caravan route after 1850.93 During the latter half of the century the slave trade went into a slow decline, although along the Borno route it continued longer and along the Wadaï route it even increased and went on doing so after 1900.94 Ivory exports, which were fairly stable, peaked around 1877. The place of slaves as items of trade was taken first by ostrich feathers, mainly from 1878 to 1883, and then by hides, especially goatskins. To these were added fabrics dyed with indigo, from the Hausa country a small quantity ofgold and a few other sundry articles. English cotton goods were the main item to be carried southwards. In i860 they represented some 70 per cent of the value of imports. Other imports consisted of North African woollen garments from Tripolitania, Austro-Hungarian textiles, woollen goods and carpets, ironmongery, medicines, devotional articles, perfumes, jewellery, silks, pearls and above all, weapons and ammunition. In addition, there was a constant demand for salt from the Sahara, dates from oases and cereals from the Sahel. 95 Trans-Saharan trade did not undergo a decline until Atlantic shipping and overland transport (railways) in West Africa began to constitute com› petitive alternatives. Political developments played a secondary though important role. The fortunes of Wadai account for the importance of the Wadai-Barka route as early as 1850. In 1895 trade by way of the TripoliBorno route suffered from the operations conducted by Rabeh, and the disruptions caused mainly by the French conquests in West Africa had their repercussions.

Whether this could be achieved or not depended entirely on African labour. Profits depended on moving goods and this meant human porterage in most of tropical Africa, for the tsetse fly often prevented the use of draught animals and the lack of roads or railways prevented powered and wheeled vehicles being used. In Middle Africa the most profitable produce was at first ivory which entailed huge quantities of labour for carrying tusks. With the development of the pneumatic bicycle tyre in the late 1880s and the pneumatic car tyre in the 1890s a huge demand for rubber was created, which could not be met for a generation by plantation rubber (the first Malayan plantation came into production in 1910). In the meantime tropical Africa and South America met the demand from wild rubber, found in Africa mostly in vines and also needing great quantities of labour for its collection and initial processing.."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'These were the major forces determining population change but there were undoubtedly others. Commerce was one, although whether such activities brought prosperity and the ability to buy food in times of need and perhaps some health care in the few places where it existed to a greater degree than it brought disease arising from increased contact with strangers is debatable. By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent. There were two reasons for the trade: firstly that alcohol could be produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits; secondly, in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, there were real problems about what goods would be accepted in return for the produce of Africa.$^{43}$ Mary Kingsley found the trade spirit pure and likely to do less harm than cannabis,$^{44}$ a view shared by a committee that investigated the liquor trade in içoç.$^{45}$ Spirits were distributed on a huge scale, frequently as wages.

It is more difficult, but perhaps not impossible, to imagine that the level of disease (venereal disease and other infections) generated during this period still resulted in a high level of female sterility half a century or more afterwards. It is also difficult to feel that the situation in this region is adequately covered by a recent United Nations' publication writing of'cultural shock' and 'the processes of adjustment'. 71 Eventually the colonial penetration was to lead to a great increase in population. This was partly due to the establishment of an economic base which is evidenced by many developments discussed in several of the chapters above. Some of the more spectacular of them were the develop› ment of palm-oil exports from the Niger delta, the discovery of diamonds and then gold in Southern Africa in the years from 1870 to 1900, the development of an indigenous cocoa-growing industry in the Gold Coast in the 1890s and the discovery of huge deposits of copper between the Congo and Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) in the early years of the century."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Furthermore, though colonialism did introduce some social services as has been pointed out already, it must be emphasized that not only were these services grossly inadequate and unevenly distributed in each colony, but they were all by and large meant primarily for the benefit of the few white settlers and administrators, hence their concentration in the towns. Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi. It was not until after the Second World War that technical schools and univer› sity colleges were established in most parts of Africa.

Under these circumstances we feel it to be our duty _again_ to call especial attention to a medicine which was for a long period constantly advertised in our columns—viz., _Lampplough\'s Pyretic Saline_. We have never admitted to our paper the general medical advertisements with which our contemporaries abound. But _Lampplough\'s Pyretic Saline_ came recommended to us by such successful use in Africa as a preventive and cure of African Fever, that we decided at once to make it known as widely as possible. And this decision has been strengthened by the beneficial results attending our own personal use of this Vital Electric Saline Medicine. Potent in cases of Yellow and African Fever, it has been so likewise in those of _Indian Cholera_. In Dr. Stevens\' account taken from the Prison Journal of Coldbath-fields, it appears that of 465 patients with severe Cholera in whom the Saline process was first put to the test of fair experiment, about 156 of which were collapse cases, there were only four deaths, while 461 recovered.* And in the same prison in thirty-nine cases not treated with the Saline, but with the old system of Calomel, Opium, Brandy, &c., _all died_.\n\nDr. Stevens\' theory and system are as follows:—\n\n""1st. The poison of Cholera, however generated, is inhaled, and, being mixed with the blood in the lungs, does, in an indefinite period, poison the whole of the vital fluid; consequently, the poisoned blood soon affects the _whole body_. The vital preservative power now makes an effort to eject the poison by vomiting and purging. In these efforts, however, the natural Saline serum of the blood is so far diminished as to leave it too vapid and thick, and, by the great diminution of the electric salts, the blood is soon too weak to stimulate the heart and capillary vessels, the action of which is essential to the evolution of heat and vital electricity, the true cause of bodily sensation.\n\n""2nd. The rational treatment of Dr. Stevens is based on an attempt to get rid of the poison, and then re-supplying the blood\n\n* Compare this with the mortality in the London Hospital, Liverpool Workhouse, &c.'}, {'id': 903, 'article_title': 'THE CHOLERA.—PREVENTIVE AND REMEDY.', 'full_section_title': 'THE CHOLERA.—PREVENTIVE AND REMEDY.', 'last_edit_date': '08-23-1866', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1866#article-19', 'issue_date': '23_08_1866', 'content': ""## August 23, 1866.\n\n---\n\nwith the lost Saline ingredients, by offering to the lacteals of the whole intestinal surface an aqueous vehicle containing them, artificially and agreeably prepared. The poison of Cholera causes intense thirst, and the plentiful supply of the fluid is readily imbibed into the blood; its power is invigorated, it acquires its wonted colour, as well as its stimulating power, and the action of the heart and the capillary system is speedily restored.\n\nNot only are we convinced that the importance of having the antidotes at hand in cases of Cholera and African and Yellow Fever cannot be too forcibly urged, but also that the precautionary use of the Pyretic Saline will either altogether prevent the attack, or so mitigate the severity as to prevent in almost all cases fatal results.\n\nFurther to facilitate the obtaining a supply of Lamplough's Pyretic Saline by our English friends, we have made arrangements by which it may be had immediately on application to Wm.

Afflicted by the painful evidences of the powerlessness of the then routine medicines to cope with the fell disease, he entered upon a regular system of patient observation and experiment in search of the needed remedy. He found it in the proved action of certain salts upon the blood; and having been able to determine at last the relative proportions of each requisite for the most effective combination, he became master of that disease which had before revelled without control. A fearful outbreak of the Fever occurred, and we write from memory, but we believe we are right when we say that, out of nearly eight hundred cases he...""}, {'id': 3244, 'article_title': 'EVOLUTION, MATERIALISM, AND CHRISTIAN BELIEF.', 'full_section_title': 'EVOLUTION, MATERIALISM, AND CHRISTIAN BELIEF.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1876#article-20', 'issue_date': '01_11_1876', 'content': '\n\n**did not lose a score.** And this was effected only by the judicious administration of that combination of salts now in an agreeable form known under the name of Lamplough\'s Pyretic Saline. This was, indeed, a triumph of patient scientific observation and experiment by a man, happily, of more than ordinary talent. So delighted and so thankful was the King of Denmark, that he bestowed upon the man who had thus, under God, been the means of preserving the lives of his subjects, an estate of no inconsiderable value. On his return to England, where he spent the latter portion of his valuable life in ease and comfort, respected and beloved, he confided the preparation of this invaluable saline combination to Mr. Lamplough, under whose careful manipulation it has obtained a wide-spread celebrity. But why was it not in such quantities at Savannah as to have controlled the plague? For the same reason that it has not been found in such quantities in other places where the Yellow Fever has suddenly appeared—for the same reason that it was not found and used sufficiently in Western Africa during the last outbreak, and that will prevent its being found and used there in sufficient quantities when the next one shall occur. Again we ask, why this? And thus we are brought at once face to face with the evils that result from the wide-spread publication of falsehoods. So many remedies are day by day advertised (we never admitted them to our columns), each one of perhaps a hundred of which is said to be infallible for the cure of every possible disease ""that flesh is heir to,"" that a bewildered public knows not where to choose, and thousands upon thousands fall victims who might have been spared to life and family and friends had they been able to distinguish the true from the false. Strongly, however, as we felt this when we read the accounts sent from Savannah, we should not have made any remarks on it in our columns, but that we have now the dread of this fell disease making its visit to the Europeans on the West Coast of Africa, with its usual attendant, the virulent Small-pox among the natives. Feeling as we do, it is our duty to warn all to be prepared. There is a family resemblance between the Small-pox and the Yellow Fever, and the same remedy, Lamplough\'s Pyretic Saline, has been triumphant with both. An account appeared in one of the Liverpool papers last spring of a vessel on which the Yellow Fever broke out at sea. The captain, it is said, had nothing on board that he could administer but Lamplough\'s Pyretic Saline. There were four men down with the Fever; he persevered in giving these the Pyretic Saline, and they all recovered. We believe he administered it at the same time to others as a preventive. There are so many places on the West Coast where medical advice and assistance cannot be obtained, that it is all-important people there should have at hand a proved remedy to which they can immediately resort. Where a competent doctor can be found, there can be little doubt he will treat both Yellow Fever and Small-pox with the Saline if he happen to have any, because its efficacy with both these diseases, as with the analogous Jungle Fever of the East Indies, has now become well known to medical men. We were glad to see, in the late admirable work of Dr. Horton, Surgeon-Major, now stationed at Cape Coast Castle, entitled ""Diseases of Tropical Climates,"" that the Doctor frequently recommends the use of it; and Dr. Horton\'s talent and long experience with tropical diseases entitle him to be regarded as an authority in such matters. We have little more to say. This paper is written under a strong sense of duty. We have now done our duty to our friends on the Coast; it rests with them as to whether they will do the duty they owe to themselves and to those about them. We have stated our apprehensions, and we have not hesitated to take upon us the responsibility of stating our firm conviction that there is an efficacious preventive and remedy to which those who are so situate that they cannot hope to obtain immediate competent medical assistance in case of attack, ought to secure access, by providing themselves with it by anticipation; and we think we scarcely need to state that our only motive in giving this advice is to be found in our anxiety that not one life should be lost that might by any possibility be preserved.'}, {'id': 4310, 'article_title': 'Sir John Kirk, K.C.M.G.', 'full_section_title': 'Sir John Kirk, K.C.M.G.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1881#article-17', 'issue_date': '01_10_1881', 'content': '""The Cedars, Tenderden, 15th July, 1880.—I have found Mistura Bismuthi Comp., prepared by Messrs.

The cholera (Asiatic or other), which has been causing so many deaths in Damietta, Cairo, and other towns and districts of Egypt, has caused also considerable inquietude throughout Europe, and called anew into being those quarantine laws an exaggerated enforcement of which produces no small amount of individual suffering, without corresponding general advantage. While the cholera (Asiatic or other) is making its ravages in Egypt, and creating a panic in Mediterranean countries, the old enemy of the tropics, the yellow fever, has been equally fatal at Vera Cruz, and other portions of the coast, in the Gulf of Mexico; and we cannot forget that on former occasions, when this dreaded malady has been thus prevalent on the Mexican Gulf shores, it has also made its destructive visit to some of the countries of the West Coast of Africa. Whether this has been through contagion by contact, or through analogous conditions of climate, seems to be uncertain. But be it which it may, the fact of the epidemic being in vigour at Vera Cruz draws our thoughts at once to Bathurst and Sierra Leone, in the former of which places the state of the drains, burial-grounds, &c., is such as to offer special invitation to yellow fever, or any other destructive malady. It is not in our power, nor within our province, to put an end to such atrocious and suicidal neglect, which has been so often exposed and animadverted upon in our columns; but we feel we should be wanting in our duty if we did not anew remind our readers of the peculiar and wonderful efficacy of **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC SALINE.** It is now some twenty years since, at the instance of General (then Colonel) Hill, who vouched for its wonderful efficacy and preservative powers, as [experienced by himself during his residence in West Africa as Governor at Sierra Leone, the West Coast, through our columns, became acquainted with it, and its merits were widely acknowledged. The **African Times** was then the only journal of and for the West Coast, and it refused to advertise any other medicine; and even **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC SALINE** was not advertised without full inquiry into its merits beyond the experience of Governor Hill. Nothing could be more satisfactory than the facts elicited in that inquiry. Its discovery was owing to researches and experiments made by Dr. Stevens in the Danish West India Island of St. Thomas. There had been most severe epidemics of yellow fever in the island; the mortality was something like seventy out of every hundred attacked. Dr. Stevens, not satisfied with the medical treatment under which the number of fatal cases was so appalling, entered upon a scientific study of the disease. He found, on examination, that in the blood taken from yellow fever patients whose attacks proved fatal, there were no globules; that the effect of the disease was to break down the globules in the blood, converting it into a thick fluid, no longer capable of sustaining life. He subjected this blood to a series of experiments, and at last succeeded by a combination of salts, &c., in reproducing globules in that blood. On this he based his treatment, and reduced the mortality during the next visit of the epidemic to less than 5 per cent. In recognition of services so eminent, His Majesty the King of Denmark bestowed on him a considerable estate, which he enjoyed until two or three years since, when he died of very advanced age at Cheltenham. **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC SALINE** is the combination with which Dr. Stevens cured his yellow fever patients, and with which also he treated some 250 cholera patients in Coldbath-fields Prison, London, during the Asiatic cholera epidemic of 1866. **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC SALINE** is, therefore, not a mere agreeable effervescing aperient, as are, without exception, we believe, the numerous effervescing salines which have sprung into existence as imitations, being for the most part only carbonate of soda, Epsom salts, and tartaric acid, which latter, being prepared from ""argols,"" or the crystals deposited in wine vats, may, indeed, with propriety, be termed a fruit salt, but which as such has no property beyond that of impelling the carbonate of soda to effervescence. We have thought it right at this time, when yellow fever may be threatening the West Coast of Africa, and cholera be threatening England, to remind our readers of the essential difference between **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC SALINE** and the host of effervescing imitations which have more or less succeeded in profiting by its fame, and thus getting into consumption. **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC—DR. STEVENS\' COMPOUND**—exercises a direct and decided regenerating and revivifying action on the blood beyond the indirect action of the other aperient salines; and as we have done from time to time during the past twenty years, so again we recommend it to the daily use of our readers, whether on the West Coast of Africa or in England.'}, {'id': 4965, 'article_title': 'Markets', 'full_section_title': 'Markets', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1884#article-25', 'issue_date': '01_11_1884', 'content': 'Every medical practitioner justly extols the value of Salines.

The use of strong purgatives is especially to be avoided; they weaken a constitution already enfeebled by tropical residence, and may bring on dysentery.\n\n4. When fever comes on there is no use trying to fight against it; by not laying up in time the attack is invariably severer, and longer in duration, and convalescence is retarded. Besides, what would be a light attack may, if neglected, end fatally, while the severest attack, judiciously treated, will end in recovery.\n\n5. Where practicable, a plunge bath should be taken every day after work, and the whole body carefully scrubbed. At home cleanliness is one of the first laws of health; in the tropics, daily ablutions are imperative.\n\n6. When the premonitory symptoms which usually precede fever are felt the patient should immediately go indoors for the remainder of the day, and take 10 grs. of quinine every two hours until three doses have been taken, if no effects (noises in the ears, &c.) have been previously felt. A saline draught will also be of advantage. If taken thus in time, most impending attacks will be aborted. If, however, the fever should come on the patient should retire to bed, get well wrapped up in blankets, and get hot drinks (tea or coffee) to make him sweat. A purgative should be taken if he has not already done so. After the sweating ceases, and the temperature has gone down, usually in five or six hours, 20 grs. of quinine should be taken, to be followed in two hours by 10 grs., if no effects have been produced by the first dose, and the 10 gr. doses may be continued every two or three hours till effects are produced. Next day, at the same time as the attack first manifested itself, the fever again returns, and the same treatment has to be gone through. Returns may thus occur daily for four or five days. Convalescence is usually quickly established, and the patient is able to resume his ordinary avocations, as a rule, the next day.\n\n7. The diet during an attack must be light—chicken broth, prepared soups, and arrowroot, with brandy and eggs in the more severe cases, where the patient shows signs of prostration. For vomiting, which is often a prominent symptom at the onset, I have never found anything effective; but when the excess of bile is got rid of it usually ceases of itself.\n\n8. If retching is continuous, champagne alone or with soda-water in small quantities seems to answer best. To overcome the restlessness at night, an anodyne draught of chloral hydrate and bromide of potassium, 15 grs. of each, dissolved in a wine-glassful of water, should be given at bed time even in the absence of a medical man; it should not be repeated, however, if it fails to have the desired effect, unless under medical supervision.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Obstacles to Advancement', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'From **David Morgan, Esq., M.D., M.R.C.S., and L.A.C., &c.**, Medical Officer of the Clerkenwell Parish: ""I have much pleasure in bearing testimony to the medicinal qualities of Mr. LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC SALINE.

1158,"European medical professionals in colonial Africa were integral to the colonial administration's civilizing mission, often compromising their impartiality and imposing Western medical practices over traditional African methods.","The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of the role of European medical professionals in colonial Africa, highlighting both their integral involvement in the colonial administration's civilizing mission and the complexities surrounding their practices. The General History of Africa underscores that European medical professionals were initially focused on military concerns, with civilian hospitals primarily serving Europeans, thereby weakening the role of traditional African doctors and prioritizing Western medical practices. This aligns with the notion of using Western medicine as a tool of colonial control, despite the text not explicitly stating a civilizing mission. The inadequate and uneven distribution of medical services, favoring Europeans, further suggests a lack of impartiality. In contrast, The African Times articles provide a nuanced perspective, acknowledging the presence and influence of European medical officers while also highlighting the challenges they faced, such as accusations of prejudice and financial motivations that could compromise their impartiality. The articles advocate for the inclusion of native African medical professionals, challenging the stereotype of African incompetence and emphasizing successful African practitioners. This suggests a dynamic where European practices were imposed, yet there was significant resistance and advocacy for integrating African methods and professionals. Together, these sources illustrate the multifaceted nature of colonial medical practices in Africa, where Western methods were both a tool of control and a point of contention.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that align with the claim that European medical professionals in colonial Africa were integral to the colonial administration's civilizing mission, often compromising their impartiality and imposing Western medical practices over traditional African methods. The text highlights that governmental medicine in tropical Africa was initially a military concern, with small civilian hospitals appearing later, primarily serving European soldiers, administrators, and missionaries. The introduction of Western medicine by colonial administrators weakened the role of traditional African doctors and herbalists, as European methods were prioritized. The text also notes that the colonial powers cut back on health expenditures during the 1930s, and the distribution of medical services was grossly inadequate and uneven, favoring Europeans over Africans. This suggests a lack of impartiality and a focus on imposing Western practices. However, the text does not explicitly state that medical professionals were part of a civilizing mission, but it implies that Western medicine was used as a tool of colonial control and influence, aligning with the broader colonial agenda of cultural imposition.","The African Times news articles provide several insights that both support and challenge the claim regarding European medical professionals in colonial Africa. The articles highlight the presence and influence of European medical officers, such as the appointment of Surgeon-Major A. D. Horne and the advertisement for assistant surgeons for the West Coast, which aligns with the notion of a civilizing mission. However, the articles also emphasize the challenges and criticisms faced by these professionals, including accusations of prejudice and refusal to treat certain individuals, as seen in the case of Dr. Skues. Additionally, there is a strong advocacy for the inclusion of native African medical professionals, suggesting a recognition of the limitations and biases of solely relying on European practices. The articles also mention the financial motivations for European doctors, such as the lucrative private practice opportunities, which could compromise their impartiality. Furthermore, the African Times argues against the stereotype that Africans lack confidence in native medical practitioners, highlighting successful African professionals and advocating for their increased involvement. This suggests a complex dynamic where European medical practices were indeed imposed, but there was also significant resistance and a push for integrating African methods and professionals.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized. In Nigeria, a dispensary was opened in Ibadan in 1904 and others followed in Yoruba towns in succeeding years.$^{81}$ By 191 o the Sierra Leonean government"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.735, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'African traditional religion and colonial rule', 'content': ""The establishment of colonial rule in Africa from 1885 onwards led to the spread of European influence far into the interior where formerly European influence had been concentrated along the coast. The entire European intervention during the colonial period was based on the assumption that to bring about development, African culture had to be modified if not destroyed altogether. Since African culture was so intricately intertwined with religion, it is easy to see how even a European colonial policy could clash violently with some of the tenets in African traditional religion which underpinned African society. And right from the very beginning, African traditional religion was faced with the challenge of survival and the need to strengthen itself.\nBefore the onset of colonial rule, the missionaries were the torch-bearers of western culture until about the beginning of the 1890s, and from the very beginning they expressed an uncompromising attitude towards African religion. They were bent not only on converting Africans to Christianity but also to western culture, which was believed to be thoroughly infused with, and profoundly informed by, Christianity. In fact, in the minds of most enthusiastic missionaries, there was no distinction between the two. But while making no distinction between their religion and culture, the missionaries endeavoured relentlessly to convert Africans to a way of life in which religion was separated from other aspects of life. The missionaries taught their converts that life could be separated into spiritual and secular spheres, a teaching which ran counter to the fundamental basis of African culture, namely the unity of religion and life. Missionary teaching thus attempted to attack the cement which held African societies together. The danger signals were picked up early by many perceptive African rulers, who initially resisted missionary penetration into their societies, seeing in it a challenge and a threat to traditional patterns of authority. Missionaries, and colonial administrators alike, preached against belief in spirits, super› natural forces and gods, witchcraft, sorcery, sacrifices and rituals, taboos and veneration of ancestors, and thus weakened the influence of African traditional and ritual leaders such as priests, priestesses, magicians, rain› makers and divine monarchs. The introduction of western medicine by the colonial administrators and their attack on 'pagan' customs also led to a weakening of the role of the traditional doctors and herbalists. The old order was thus severely threatened and attempts to defend and protect it came from many sectors of African society."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'. France, he continued, was guaranteeing 'the economic growth and human development' of its colonies. 2"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.715, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Both statements suggest that paternalistic attitude which had thoroughly permeated European thought about colonial Africa and which was both internationalized and institutionalized with the mandates system that emerged from the League of Nations after the First World War. In the language of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the colonial effort, particularly in Africa, was now proclaimed to be a responsibility undertaken in the name of higher civilization, with 'the tutelage of such peoples [the colonial populations] ... entrusted to advanced nations'. 3 Behind such rhetoric still stood an attitude of cultural and racial superiority, formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly given expression in descriptions of the African as childlike or 'non-adult'. The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory. In retrospect, the period can clearly be seen as the one in which the bureaucratization of colonial administration occurred."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Increased European pressures', 'content': 'Missionary work, during the period under discussion, was in its pion› eering phase. On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Furthermore, though colonialism did introduce some social services as has been pointed out already, it must be emphasized that not only were these services grossly inadequate and unevenly distributed in each colony, but they were all by and large meant primarily for the benefit of the few white settlers and administrators, hence their concentration in the towns. Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi. It was not until after the Second World War that technical schools and univer› sity colleges were established in most parts of Africa. And significantly, only one university college each was established in the Gold Coast in 1947, in Nigeria in 1948, in Uganda in 1950, in Senegal and Madagascar in 1950, in Salisbury in 1953, in Congo Leopoldville in 1954 and Elizabethville in 1956.

To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures.

Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively. Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s. Nevertheless, tropical medical schools were established in Europe as early as 1897 in Liverpool and London, 1900 in Hamburg, 1901 in Brussels, followed later by Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles, and in Africa by 1912 in Cape Town and 1918 in Dakar."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.698, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""Even worse still was the impact of colonialism in the cultural field. Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""Yet this was not what the European colonial administrators actually intended. Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Economic and social change in Liberia and Ethiopia, 1915-35 > Ethiopia', 'content': 'the medical field, mainly by missionaries, notably the United Presbyterian Church of North America, the Seventh Adventist Mission, and the Italian Catholic Mission, all of which operated hospitals in Addis Ababa, while the Sudan Interior Mission ran a leprosarium at Akaki.$^{75}$ Other developments included the creation of a small civil service, partly formed with students returning from abroad, which received salaries instead of the revenues from fiefs, and the increasing replacement of tribute in kind by taxes in cash. A decree to curtail labour services from the peasant was enacted in 1934, and legislation for the reform of the land tax in 1935. Efforts at modernization were, however, by then overshadowed by the impending threat of Italian Fascist invasion. 76 Thus the period between 1915 and 1935 witnessed a wider spread and a greater degree of economic and social change in Liberia and Ethiopia than before. However, this change did not amount to much and both countries therefore remained economically backward and socially undevel› oped.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains.

As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

Though the number of patients has not been large, yet it is increasing, as the institution becomes known; and through God\'s help we have accomplished that which we proposed seven years ago—namely, the erection of a house for the sick and suffering, where they may receive help and comfort, both for body and soul. We have a kind Christian lady as the matron, and the colonial physician is the surgeon and physician of the institution. Of all our patients the seamen seem most grateful. Far away from home and friends, to meet with care and kindness, and to find the comforts of a home, with Christian sympathy; these things call out those warm and generous feelings for which seamen are proverbial.

For not only is the time of service on that coast doubly reckoned, but they enjoy besides the substantial advantage of private practice. This advantage they do not enjoy in the West Indies, private practice being in the hands of the civil medical practitioners. That the emoluments from this source are considerable, may be judged of by the fact that the late colonial surgeon of Sierra Leone is understood to have realised the handsome sum of 20,000l., and the yearly income of the present colonial surgeon of that colony from official and private practice is, as has been stated by himself and friends, 1,200l. or 1,500l. per annum. We are glad, therefore, to know that some of the native gentlemen are educating their sons to the medical profession. A beginning has been made in this direction, Messrs. Smith and Spilsberry being far advanced medical students at King's College, and the appointment to staff-assistant-surgeoncies of Drs. Davis and Horton is a proof that the Government is alive to the advantages of having coloured medical officers attached to the regiments stationed in West Africa. Strangely, however, their appointment is viewed almost as an intrusion by some of their European professional brethren on the coast, and we have heard it rumoured that one of these medical gentlemen had it even in contemplation to resign his commission rather than subject himself to the passive, but not less harassing annoyances to which he had been subjected. Be that as it may, it is of importance that every encouragement should be held out by the Government to native gentlemen who have qualified themselves to hold appointments either in the army or colonial medical service in West Africa. We are aware that against the appointment of native medical gentlemen the argument is constantly advanced, that neither Europeans nor Africans have confidence in them. This assertion we emphatically deny, and beg to record our protest against it. And if evidence were wanting of its utter groundlessness, we could, in support of our statement, triumphantly point to the late Staff Surgeon William Fergusson, a dark mulatto gentleman (afterwards Governor of Sierra Leone), in whose medical skill both Europeans and natives had unbounded confidence. To assert, therefore, that the advice of native medical officers would not be esteemed, is the flimsiest of pretences. From all we have learnt, we suspect that the true reason of the opposition offered by European medical officers on this head may be traced to their natural apprehension that the lucrative field of private practice, now in the hands of a few, would be greatly diminished when black or coloured medical gentlemen come to contest it with them."", 'last_edit_date': '1863-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1863#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.745, 'probability_score': 0.07, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SURGEONS FOR THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""understand why the Army Medical Department has resorted to a proceeding so unusual, and, in our opinion, so wholly unnecessary, as that of advertising for surgeons for the West Coast of Africa, unless, indeed, it may have been considered politically fair to endeavor to save the warrant of 1859, which grants the privilege of every year's service there being reckoned as two years; and that, with such object in view, it was essential to impress the public mind anew with what has been so long endorsed upon it—viz., that the climate is of the most deadly nature. No grounds that we can perceive can justify such a step in face of the facts we are about to detail, and which incontestably prove that European medical officers (and others), instead of shrinking from service in West Africa, on the contrary, prefer the West Africa stations to those of the West Indies; and not unfrequently volunteer for the Coast. Indeed, the substantial privileges they enjoy in West Africa, in the shape of every year's service being doubly reckoned, besides the advantages of private practice—a privilege from which they are debarred in the West Indies, by private practice there being in the hands of civil medical practitioners—are, we affirm, keenly appreciated by them. There is no difficulty in proving this assertion. Beginning at the Gambia, we find that the present principal medical officer has already served twice on the Gold Coast, preferring to remain at the Gambia, and getting his appointment as surgeon to one of the West India regiments cancelled. In the same way Mr. M'D., who had been stationed on the Gold Coast, and at the Gambia, had his request granted to be relieved of the surgeoncy of a West India regiment, to return to the Coast, and it is well known that the late Mr. Brien most reluctantly accepted the appointment of surgeon to the 2nd West India Regiment, stationed at Barbadoes, where he was cut off by yellow fever, after having served once at the Gambia, and twice on the Gold Coast. Again, three of the staff assistant-surgeons have been stationed, two of them once on the Gold Coast, and one twice at the Gambia. We moreover find that Mr. Robertson, the present Colonial Secretary at the Gambia, had previously been Colonial Surgeon from 1835 to 1849, and is still in the enjoyment of good health. His successor as Colonial Surgeon retired on a comfortable pension, after a service of ten years; and the gentleman at present holding that office has now held it some four or five years. The present judge at the Gambia also commenced his official career, in 1837, as Assistant Colonial Surgeon, and has lived there, with the exception of occasional visits to England, from that time until now, in the enjoyment of a fair share of health. If we turn to Sierra Leone, we find that the late Colonial Surgeon lived there from 1831 to 1854, and in that long period went only twice home. The present Colonial Surgeon, whose appointment dates from January, 1856, had previously served as Staff Assistant-Surgeon at the Gambia and Sierra Leone, and with the exception of a severe attack of fever during the prevalence of the epidemic, or yellow fever, in 1859, has enjoyed good health. His brother, at present Assistant Colonial Surgeon, has likewise been appointed some time, and we are glad to know that his salary has been increased from 200l. to 300l. per annum, and that he is not restricted as preceding assistant colonial surgeons at Sierra Leone were from private practice. On the Gold Coast there is Mr. O'Callaghan, who has volunteered to serve there for the third time; and we can likewise adduce Mr. Clarke, who served many years both at Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast."", 'last_edit_date': '1863-12-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1863#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SURGEONS FOR THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In our next number we shall continue our remarks on this highly-important subject.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Apart from such paltry considerations, we strenuously advocate their appointment as army and colonial medical officers on the coast, because, in a financial point of view, such appointments would save the large sum of money which at present is annually expended in providing European medical officers with passages to and from the coast.

This fact should never be lost sight of, because the mortality from yellow fever in West Africa is occasionally appalling, as in 1859, when three European medical men were cut off by it at MacCarthy's Island.\n\nAlthough we have before referred to the absurd assertions of those opposed to the appointment of black or coloured surgeons, we nevertheless again do so, for the purpose of more completely refuting them. We shall not, however, waste words upon the subject, but simply state that the capabilities of the negro race may be inferred by their holding at Sierra Leone the appointments of Chief Justice, Colonial Secretary, Registrar of Mixed Commission Court, Marshal to the Vice-Admiralty Court, Collector of Customs, Sheriff and Crown Record Office; the Counsel at the Sierra Leone Bar being also coloured gentlemen; by Mr. Ingram's recent appointment as Queen's Advocate at the Gambia; and nearly by all the clerks in the Government and merchants' offices being black or coloured persons. Besides, we are also aware that by far the most talented, influential, and wealthy merchant now upon that coast is of African descent. Moreover, we likewise know, from the best authority, that the Rev. Mr. Robin, Acting Colonial Chaplain (one of the many ordained black clergymen on the Coast—a pure-blooded negro), received from the Governors of the Gold Coast and Gambia the highest commendations, his conduct being brought by them under the favourable notice of Her Majesty's Government. Further, none more strongly urged the appointment of black surgeons than the late Bishop Bowen did, and surely it may be conceded that he was a competent judge of their fitness.*"", 'last_edit_date': '1863-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1863#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SURGEONS FOR THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""In our last number we briefly remarked on the Army Medical Department having recently advertised for assistant-surgeons for service in our West African colonies.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

It can be observed that a culturally cohesive community was maintained in this way, across geographical boundaries. The night-long bira ceremonies which moved early into the possession of the medium, thereafter into the purely social pleasures of dancing, singing, poetic (including comic) recitals and mimicry, have been aptly described as 'a long, communal journey through the night'.

This is a variety whose nutritive value and palatability is at its highest soon after the first spring rains and in the early months of the summer season. But the food value and palatability of sourveld grass decreases as it matures. Sourveld, therefore, tends to provide grazing for roughly four months of the year before it begins to lose both its food value and palatability. Sweetveld, on the other hand, tends to be rather more characteristic of the drier parts of the country, where it is usually found in association with scattered trees in savanna vegetation types of which it generally forms the understorey. Although sparse and easily damaged, sweetveld grass retains its palatability and food value throughout the dry season. Sweetveld is therefore particularly important as winter grazing. Between these two extremes of sweet and sourveld grazing can be found transitional belts of mixed veld capable of supporting grazing for some six to eight months in the year. 12 While other parts of Southern Africa such as the areas occupied by the Sotho-Tswana communities of what is now the Transvaal highveld did also have considerable tracts of sweetveld coverage, such areas nevertheless lacked the river system of the northern Nguni area, which ensured that the low rainfall parts of the region had the paradoxical feature of being dry, but well-watered.$^{13}$ Also, on the highveld tracts of sweetveld, pasturage often occurred in association with tsetse fly, which causes sleeping sickness in man and animals alike."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.557, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'On the eve of the nineteenth century', 'content': ""the spread of Mwari must have fundamentally altered the cosmology of the indigenous inhabitants.$^{19}$ Culture change, however, was not unidirectional.

By the beginning of the nineteenth century, several Itsekiri chiefs had moved from Warri (Ode Itsekiri) to establish trading posts on the Benin estuary, and soon the Benin port of Gwato (Ughoton) ceased to be a centre of the overseas trade. Throughout the nineteenth century, then, the Itsekiri were the effective leaders in the trade of the western delta, and Benin had to receive supplies of European goods through them.3 Benin tried to maintain political dominance over the Itsekiri kingdom, and demanded a form of tribute in trade goods from the Olu of Warri, on pain of the closure of the hinterland trade routes. However, Olu Akengbuwa was able to defy the oba of Benin, to the extent of giving asylum to a dissident Benin chief. But when Akengbuwa died in 1848, his subjects believed him a victim of the qba's curse, which was also thought to have kept the Itsekiri without a ruler from 1848 to 1936."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.562, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905.

We think we can discern two indentations in the forehead, which appear to be eyes, but the highest magnifying power we have is the microscope out of a sextant. Its neck is protected by a shield, also dark brown, either in two parts, or made to appear so by a lighter stripe down the middle; its legs are brown, and seem at first only like small hooks, but examination shows that they are beautifully jointed; and along each side, just at the edge of the belly, is a double row of a dozen dark spots, the uppermost of which seems to be merely colours, while the lower is a small tubercle, with a dark-edged circular orifice. We were much puzzled by a covering of green matter, similar in colour to the leaf it feeds on. At first we thought it was the first skin peeling off, and lay in loose rolls parallel to the transverse muscular rings of the body; it seemed gradually driven forward toward the head, where it formed a shield, or hood, portions breaking off as it dried, and being replaced by fresh. At length we were enabled to decide that it must be the excrement of the creature, issuing not only in the usual manner, but from the pores that are scattered over nearly the whole of the body. When the grub attains a length of three quarters of an inch, this matter is more sparingly distributed, and is of a brownish colour. In a short time the grub drops from the tree, and burying itself about two feet below the surface, forms its cocoon of a thin shell of earth agglutinated round its body. Its entrails, or rather the whole internal juices, are in all stages of its grubhood of the most deadly nature, and if brought in contact with a cut or sore of any kind, cause the most excruciating agony.

The admission of a flock of turkeys soon abated this pest, as the turkey is passionately fond of live snails and grasshoppers, and will gorge itself on first admission, but afterwards fatten on them. One turkey will often have a quart of snail-shells in his craw in a day's feed of an infested field. Grasshoppers and snails commit more silent damage in the Bahamas than is commonly noticed. Vigilance in watching the progress of the new East India castor-oil plant caused their detection, the ravage of the sap making the plant turn a pale green and fade away. For snails feed at night, and early in the morning, during the heat of daylight, encase themselves away to hide beneath the densest leaves, close by the stems. The method of preparing castor-oil here is so well known as hardly to need description—viz., first parching the ripe beans, then beating them in a mortar, rolling the mass in balls, and boiling them in pots of sea-water taken from the sea at new and full moon, at a flowing tide, under the impression that the yield is then greater; the oil being skimmed off as it rises to the surface of the boiling sea-water, then fried down a little in another pot to remove any water dipped up in skimming it, and placed in open vessels to cool and clarify, previous to bottling up for sale or future use.\n\nThis boiling process must be better than cold-pressed castor-oil, because some portion of the raw castor-oil bean is a deadly poison, two or three seeds eaten raw being sufficient to bring on a severe attack of cholera morbus. Many suppose this acid-poison lies in the white skin covering over the soft kernel within the seed-case, or hard shell covering of the bean. One of the most delicious sauces for meats or fish known in the West Indies—Cassareep—is made of the juice of the poison Cassava, seasoned with condiments. The fire neutralizes or transforms the vegetable poison in most cases; Cassava, baked or roasted thoroughly, being healthy food, that when raw, or even half cooked, cannot be eaten with impunity. Castor-oil seed is better sown broadcast, in newly-hoed fields, than planted too deep with a hoe; needs atmospheric influence of sun, rain, and earth to germinate quickly; has been known to remain buried several feet under ground for over twenty years, unimpaired in vigour of germ; and being exhumed to the surface of the soil in digging a cow-well, sprouted and took root in three days, and then throve to well-bearing trees of red variety."", 'last_edit_date': '1876-10-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1876#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.604, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'A New Cure for Poisonous Snake-bites', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""A Brazilian"" writes to the *Times* with respect to the discovery by Dr. Lacerda of the properties of permanganate of potassium as an antidote for snake poison, and says there can be no doubt whatever as to its efficacy.

Most of the rooms are miserably small, dark, damp, and badly ventilated, especially those devoted to sleep.

So much attention has been given to flax as a commercial exportable staple, that other sorts of fibre have not had the attention given to them that they deserve. May it not be that we have been too exclusive in this respect, and that had part of the time and money devoted to flax, with it must be confessed but small result, been applied to other plants, far larger measures of practical good would have been done?\n\n*China-grass*, or, as it is often called, *Rhea-hemp*, grows well here. It is obtained from the Snowy Nettle, ""the *Urtica*, or *Boehmeria nivea*, a plant abundant in China and India,"" and which grows in the United States. The name is caused by the white tint of the under side of the leaves. The commercial value of its fibre is great. Mr. Squier sets it down at about 100l. a-ton, but taking a more moderate estimate, and accepting rather the results of inquiries made by persons living in Natal we may set the market value of it down at from 50l. to 80l. per ton. A gentleman living near Verulam, who knows something of the local growth of the plant, says that he would give the preference to it almost over every other product of the same kind, and that he has ascertained from large manufacturers at home that there is an indefinite market for it. Mr. R. Clarence at one time cultivated a patch of it, and harvested a stack, but want of labour at the time to manipulate it prevented his pursuing the enterprise further. As we write we refer to Morgan\'s Trade List for May 2, where the last quotation is to be found, and there China-grass is quoted at 80l. to 85l., so that the above figures are by no means wide of the mark. We are assured by practical growers that the plant flourishes here. It is susceptible to frost, and would have therefore to be planted early in the spring; but so far as a rough experiment justifies a judgment, the results of *Rhea* or *China-grass* culture would well repay the endeavour to establish this staple.

Most of the caterpillars of the country cover themselves with silky envelopes, which protect them both from the inclemency of winter and the sudden showers of the summer season. Some are naturally covered from their birth with a thick mantle which grows with them, leaving only the head and legs uncovered. Others spin double and treble cocoons, and others again mix up various particles of plants with their silk, combining them artistically; and, lastly, there are some which spin a common nest, in which they live under a republican form of government, each individual spinning its own cocoon besides. The last number of the Bulletin de la Societe d'Acclimatation contains a curious paper on this subject by M. Auguste Vinson, of La Réunion. He states that the Hovas weave a kind of silk which they call landy; and is obtained from the worm that feeds on the leaves of the ambrevade, or Angola pea (Cytisus cajanus). This silk is heavy, and has no gloss, but is exceedingly strong. The natives sell the tissues they weave out of this silk very dear, and it is therefore only the rich who wear them. King Radama II., who dresses in the European fashion, wears trousers and a paletôt made of this silk, which, not being dyed, is of a grey colour, like unbleached linen. The wealthy are buried in shrouds made of this silk, and it is said that such shrouds entombed for centuries have been exhumed in a perfect state of preservation. The ambrevade being an indigenous plant of La Réunion,* this Madagascar silkworm might be easily introduced there. The insect is 45 millimetres long; its body is composed of 12 segments, and covered with black sharp horny points all over. The general hue is a chestnut brown, but the abdomen has a longitudinal rose-coloured streak between two other light brown ones. The cocoon is 70 millimetres in circumference, and 45 in length; it is very heavy, of a dirty grey colour, but interspersed with black bristles. The chrysalis contained in the cocoon is edible, and considered a delicacy by the Hovas, who eat it fried."", 'last_edit_date': '1863-10-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1863#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.574, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'To Preserve Shingle Roofs from Fire', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—An African friend informs me an incendiary lately tried to set his house on fire whilst his family were asleep in their beds, by placing on the shingles a piece of burning canvas, which had been previously soaked in oil.
