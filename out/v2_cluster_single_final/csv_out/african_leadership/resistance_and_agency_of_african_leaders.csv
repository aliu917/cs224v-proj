5,"The ceremonial use of captured Ayors in Dahomey, alongside symbolic challenges to Ayors' cultural norms and a complex legal system that included capital offenses for shedding human blood, reflects a nuanced power dynamic and societal structure that both revered and feared its government.","The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present a multifaceted view of Dahomey's societal structure and power dynamics, particularly concerning the ceremonial use of captured Ayors. The General History of Africa does not directly address the ceremonial practices or legal norms related to the Ayors in Dahomey, focusing instead on broader political and social transformations across Africa during the nineteenth century. This absence of specific information on Dahomey's legal system and cultural practices suggests that the textbook does not cover all aspects of African societies during this period. In contrast, The African Times articles provide detailed accounts of the ceremonial use of captured Ayors, such as making them carry silk damask to symbolize victory over their ancestors, aligning with the claim of symbolic challenges to Ayors' cultural norms. The articles also describe the execution of Ayors during royal customs, reflecting a power dynamic that instills both fear and reverence towards the Dahomean government. However, the claim of a complex legal system with capital offenses for shedding human blood is contradicted by the articles, which highlight frequent human sacrifices and executions as part of royal customs, suggesting a societal structure that normalized such violence rather than legally prohibiting it. The articles further emphasize the Dahomean government's despotism and the king's role in perpetuating human sacrifices, complicating the notion of a nuanced legal system. Together, these sources provide a complex picture of Dahomey's societal structure, underscoring both the symbolic and brutal aspects of its power dynamics.","The provided paragraphs from the General History of Africa textbook do not directly address the ceremonial use of captured Ayors in Dahomey or the specific cultural and legal dynamics mentioned in the claim. The text primarily discusses the political and social transformations in various African regions during the nineteenth century, focusing on the emergence of new power structures, the impact of wars, and the adaptation of political systems. While the text does mention the complex societal structures and the role of warriors in maintaining power, it does not provide specific details about Dahomey's legal system or cultural practices related to the Ayors. This absence of information on Dahomey's ceremonial practices and legal norms regarding capital offenses for shedding human blood highlights a difference between the claim and the content of the textbook. An expert historian might find this lack of specific reference to Dahomey and its societal dynamics noteworthy, as it suggests that the textbook does not cover all aspects of African societies during this period.","The African Times news articles provide several details that both support and refute the claim regarding the ceremonial use of captured Ayors in Dahomey and the societal structure. The articles describe the ceremonial use of captured Ayors, such as making them carry silk damask to symbolize the victory over their ancestors, which aligns with the claim of symbolic challenges to Ayors' cultural norms.

This was true of the lands lying in the Niger Bend and the Volta basin in the nineteenth century. While we have few documents on this aspect of the historical process, it appears that social changes were greater in centralized states than in societies in which administration was decentralized, greater in the coastal regions than in the lands of the interior, and greater in Islamized areas than elsewhere. While sedentary societies that did not have a centralized power structure were the most affected by the convulsions of the time, they took refuge in fidelity to their traditional code of life as an antidote to their trials.\nThe situation of slaves and caste members was much worse in centralized states. The most radical upheaval was undoubtedly the one that occurred in the Fulbe groups: originally nomads under the domination of the Gulmanceba, within a few years after the djiKäd they in turn had become overlords ruling indigenous peoples, or peoples whom they had reduced to the level of commoners, captives and serfs (bellah or remaibe), condemned to the tasks of cultivation and herding. In addition, there were artisans and griots. It was a meticulously stratified society in which every individual had and knew his place. Over and above one-fifth of all plunder taken in raids, 57 the amir of Liptako received gifts and a tribute on harvests that was known as the zakat. Similarly, the chiefs of Jiibo received gifts at 'salutations' and levied a tax on salt for which traders were liable. Aristocrats were sometimes attended by hundreds of dependants. While the conditions of slaves improved with seniority (rimaibe could own property), the status of captives was to raise problems in Liptako. 'Uthman dan Fodio himself advised the amir to free slaves who had taken part in the struggle against the Gulmanceba. Furthermore in 1861 the Amïr Seeku Saalu was confronted by a slave uprising touched off by the marabout Abdul Kadiri, who aspired to seize power.

Due to a by no means unusual time-lag, European decisions to abolish the slave trade did not prevent it from reaching a paroxysm in the course of the nineteenth century in a number of countries on the Niger Bend and in the upper basin of the various affluents of the Volta. Emancipation by the state and reintegration into lineage groups did little to reduce the destructive effects of this scourge, which was not to abate until the end of the nineteenth century. In fact, those countries whose economies had been kept going by the 'ports of the desert' at the end of the caravan routes were now enclosed and isolated, being separated from the coast by other states, at a time when basic trading patterns were collapsing. In such circumstances they were bound, slowly but inexorably, to fall into decline.\nIn these circumstances, as often happens in periods of crisis, social divisions were exacerbated, transforming the relatively egalitarian struc› tures that had been characteristic of the societies of the Sahel during their period of ascendancy. Another factor was the evolution of the religious movements which, after the tolerance towards traditional cults shown during the preceding centuries, had adopted a more intransigent attitude as a result of the djihad, which had triumphed in Liptako and had swept through the Bambara states. Even the YarsØ of the Mossi country, pre› viously so flexible in both religious and political affairs, began to take up much more rigid positions and engaged in proselytism.

Cutting across the lineage system of non-centralized societies, a variety of integrative institutions developed in the religious, judicial and economic fields which could function as an overall framework of order or replace a disintegrating state-system.$^{25}$ The poro and similar associations in Upper Guinea, or various so-called 'secret societies' in the Cross river and equatorial forest areas of the Cameroons and Gabon are examples.

In Bunafu, not only was there a sense of government and authority, some of the migrants came with traditions of structured hierarchical political systems from which they were fleeing, but which they still drew upon in the rivalries that accompanied the emergence of a new authority system in Bunafu. Others also carried with them belief in the power of a the mukama, a charismatic prince chosen and possessed by the god, or the efficacy of ritual firelighting from royal hearths, to affect fertility and harvests.

We have already observed that the twentieth-century development that allowed the Aja in the area of the present-day Badagry local government area of Lagos State in Nigeria to adopt the Yoruba oba-ship institution must be traced to the nineteenthcentury and pre-nineteenth century migrations and resultant adoption of Yoruba institutions by the Aja. Similarly, Oyo cultural influences found in eastern Yorubaland - worship of Sango, the spread of the men's loom, shoulder sling drums - must be considered not so much as evidence of Oyo hegemony before 1800 as of the nineteenth-century diaspora of the Oyo following the fall of the empire. 38 A similar influence from Benin, especially on court ceremonials, regalia and chieftaincy titles in Qwo, Ekiti, Akoko, Ondo, Ijesa - as among the Awori astride the present-day Nigeria-Benin border - showed the widespread effect of the theme of inter-group penetration and com› mensurate institutional adaptation.

The socio-political impact of Benin on other Edo-speaking peoples as well as the Itsekiri, the Urhobo, and the Isoko to the east and north of Benin has been much more systematically studied. 39 Above all, the nineteenth century witnessed the foundation of the modern settlement pattern in which location along or close to the coast conferred great advantages: witness, for example, the heightened status of Warri visà-vis Benin, Lagos vis-à-vis the rest of Yorubaland, Porto Novo, Whydah and, most spectacular of all, Cotonou on the Aja coast.

These changes occurred without civil strife, in part because there had always been considerable autonomy in outlying districts, the growing prosperity of which made office at the capital less important.\nSo far only the upper levels of the administrative system have been discussed. Administration at the 'grass roots' was more uniform (and similar to that found elsewhere in West Africa). The smallest units, households or camps, were grouped into larger units, defined by a territory or by kinship. Generally pastoralists, Tuareg or Fulbe, were more organized through links of kinship than were agriculturalists, and in consequence retained their own ardo'en or tambura as leaders. Their cohesion gave them a political strength that the more fragmented agriculturalists did not have, but this superior strength relative to the rest of the population did not last into the second half of the century.\nIn larger, long-settled towns and villages ward representatives could be co-ordinated by one of their number, known as the mai gari, magaji, dagaci or mukoshi. The links between these representatives of the local population and the upper levels of the administration were in the hands ofjakadu, servants or agents of the office-holder allocated the responsibility for that section of the population. Similarly, messengers linked the office-holder to his amir. The function of the administration was primarily tax collection, but this was as much a political as an economic act; to pay was also a symbolic act of submission, to refuse payment was a token of rebellion. As a necessary part of tax collection, the administration gathered political information, ratified appointments; collected shares of inheritance, took charge of and dispatched the property of strangers who died en route; organized the arrest of a criminal or a runaway slave, forwarded defendants in civil cases, arranged the release of someone wrongfully detained or someone to be ransomed; took intractable cases for mediation by the office› holder or themselves answered charges of oppression by complainants at the amir's personal court; and in time of war organized the recruitment of people for campaigns.

In practice, the chief was invariably a member of the Nyorgo family. The insignia of the office was a staff (symbolizing stock-breeding) hung with various kinds of agricultural products.

The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.623, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Cross river basin > The Ekpe society and the Bloodmen', 'content': 'The social and political history of Calabar, then, was similar to that of the delta states in the types of external pressures to which the system was subject, but different in the specific internal resolution of the problems.

Then animals were sacrificed to the genii and to a sacred snake. A new traditional drum was made, to be included among the symbols of power granted by the Sokoto council. 44 The new amir's head was swathed in a turban by one of the Torodbe in the presence of the chief imam and the kadi, and facing the standard he swore to respect the customs and principles of Islam and to maintain the welfare of his people.

But the new governors were overthrown and replaced by pre-existing dynasties during widespread revolts against his increasingly harsh rule. 20 The similarities between Liberia's and Ethiopia's political systems were too obvious from the analysis thus far to belabour. Besides possessing a core and periphery, and a central government, each had sub-political systems centred on local chiefdoms (or villages) like those of the Gola in Liberia or the Oromo ('Galla') in Ethiopia not discussed in this chapter, with political cultures more or less different from the dominant political culture at the centre.

I only regret that it was not diffusing its light and striking its redoubtable blows at political and moral corruption on the Gold Coast a few years earlier. It would have prevented much injustice, and saved the British name from many a blot, which has greatly damaged its prestige among the tribes of Western Africa, and made the very name of good old England a laughing-stock to the foreigner—the Dutch, the French, and the American traders on the coast.\n\nWith regard to Dahomey—respecting which my long and intimate knowledge of the country, the King, the chiefs and people, entitle, I think, my opinion to some weight—I beg to urge that the cause of humanity demands the utmost efforts of every one who is interested in the moral regeneration of Pagan Africa.\n\nI hope we may shortly hear that Commodore Wilmot has succeeded in his enterprise, and that by peaceful measures the dangers impending over Abeokuta will be averted; and that, by judicious instructions furnished to the King and his chiefs by agencies from England, Dahomey may become that magnificent cotton field for which its soil and other capabilities give it such a peculiar adaptation.\n\nI have anxiously watched, from month to month, the progress of public opinion in England relative to the most suitable policy for meeting the Dahoman difficulty; and I have been very glad indeed to observe the prevalence of a tendency to pacific measures.\n\nI should deprecate any hostile movement against Dahomey, until all pacific means are utterly exhausted. The masses of the people in Dahomey are an agricultural people; and there is more cultivation of the soil in Dahomey than there is in Ashantee, or, I may say, in almost any other country westward of that state between Whydah and Apollonia. The Dahomans are warriors, in favour of the slave-trade, from a necessity arising out of the despotism of their Government so impelling them; but strange as it may seem, they have a peculiar genius for agriculture, and could, I think, be easily led into the working out of a great national scheme for cotton cultivation. But any such scheme must be well-conceived, and carried out with vigour, in extensive detail.\n\nI would warn all parties interested against any half measures in reference to Dahomey—be they either for peace or war. Whatever is done should, to secure success, be done on an extensive and imposing scale.

The party includes the king\'s great chiefs, Chedingar and Ayumkuken; his messenger, Tassah; Mr. Henry Dasos, an interpreter, and Mr. John P. Jackson, editor of *The Lagos Record*. The chiefs stoutly deny that the King of Dahomey is the inhuman monster he has been represented to be. They affirm that no human sacrifices are offered in Dahomey, except at the annual ""Royal custom,"" which, however, has been suspended for the past four years. At this custom all the royal maidens are required to fetch water from the sacred streams of Golutar. This water is sprinkled in the royal mausoleum, after which sacrifices of sheep and oxen are made by the fetish priest, followed by a human sacrifice, the victim being commissioned to convey messages to the spirits of the deceased kings, and to invoke their guidance and protection for the throne and kingdom. The chiefs, in support of the foregoing, assert that of the 4,000 Yorubas captured in the last raid at Abeokuta four years ago, not one has been offered in sacrifice, and that it is a capital offence to shed human blood in Dahomey, and also that any chief or prince who would cause one of his servants to be beaten so that he fainted would be imprisoned for life. The chiefs were well pleased with the treatment and comfort they received on the voyage to England, and what they saw in the Liverpool streets and docks caused them great surprise.\n\nThese envoys took 21 days to get from Dahomey to Lagos on account of their adopting a circuitous route in order to avoid the French troops who are now operating in Dahomey. The Chief Chedingar takes to France the staff of King Behanzin, which is entirely made of silver, and represents the head of the sacred shark of Dahomey.

Those expectations were formed on the supposition that he might possess some few grains of common sense, which would place vividly before his mental vision the dangers of collision between an earthen pot and a sledge hammer wielded by an arm of power. It seems to be now past dispute that, instead of disowning the acts of the brutal authorities at Whydah, who showed themselves to be fit servants to such a master, he has put a bold front on the matter, and sent the insolent message that ""he will pay the Commodore in powder and bullets if he will come up to Abomey."" This is the language that might be expected only from a doomed idiot, vapouring among the spiritless slaves by whom he may be surrounded, and who have worshipped him as almost a god, until he believes himself to be quite one. It is clearly full time that both King and people should be undeceived by coming in rude contact with something more than a few European trading clerks and agents, who, naturally enough, in the interests of their trade, submit, uncomplainingly, to everything short of actual plunder and brutal violence. Our opinions and feelings respecting the frantic iniquity of Dahomey are so strong, and our conviction that it is the imperative duty of Great Britain, as the real protecting Power on the West Coast of Africa, to put a final end to its enormities as being a daily insult to humanity, is so unalterable, that all we can say in reply to the braggart King is that we hope he will continue in his present frame of mind, and not be moved to feigned repentance by the blockade of his sea-ports. We do not wish him to repent, and thus save himself and his authority from destruction—unless his repentance should go so far (which it never would do) as to secure his faithful acquiescence in British demands, that he should never henceforth make any inroads into Egba territories in search of victims for his atrocious festivals, and that those festivals of blood should be entirely put an end to. The earth has groaned long enough under this blood-thirsty monster, and the devilish system that he at this time represents. That system is incurable by any other means than the entire destruction of the Power with which it is identified, and of which it is an inseparable part. The late King, and the present also, more than once declared to Europeans who have been on missions to Abomey, that even were he desirous of doing so, he could not discontinue that perpetual series of human sacrifices in which his people delight; that his prestige would be gone, and that he in his turn would be a victim if he ceased to justify by deeds his title of ""Man-slayer."" There is possibly truth in this. The people, like their King, are accustomed to sniff the, to them, intoxicating odour of the reeking blood of victims slaughtered before their eyes, and would object to be deprived of a gratification they have so long enjoyed. Under such circumstances there is only one way of purifying the horribly polluted atmosphere of Dahomey, and that is by bringing a superior force to bear upon King, people, and institutions. As already stated, we have ourselves always held the opinion that it was the duty of a civilized Christian Power such as Great Britain to interfere in the interests of humanity. There are now other interests, in addition to those of mere humanity, urging and impelling to the work. Not only has one of her subjects been grievously maltreated, but the financial interests of the Gold Coast Colony are very prejudicially interfered with by the action of Dahomey as a marauding State. The yearly armed expeditions into the Egba territories, even up to the immediate neighbourhood of Abeokuta, in quest of plunder and victims for sacrifice in the ""Customs,"" inflict very great injury not only on the industrious Egba agriculturists, but also, as a necessary result, on the revenues of Lagos. There is an annual scare in the Egba territories. Farms are deserted, the people take refuge in Abeokuta, and their property is wasted and destroyed. We feel sure that we do not exaggerate when we say that were those marauding inroads to cease, and to cease at the absurd certainty that there will not be any renewal of them, agricultural industry will take so great a development in the Egba countries that the production would be doubled, with corresponding advantage to the', 'last_edit_date': '1876-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1876#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.625, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CUSTOMS OF DAHOMEY AND ASHANTI.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There is no evil or atrocity too great and hideous to find a defender or extenuator.

But the Illustrated News has thus offended. In its number of Sept. 6, à propos of the dancers of Dahomey, it asserts that those horrible massacres, those human sacrifices in the customs of Dahomey, ""are neither more nor less than the solemn execution of a number of criminals and prisoners of war who have been legally condemned to death, and whose decapitation is superintended by the monarch with more formal ceremony than is used by the civilized Governments of Europe.""

""Prisoners of war, who have been legally condemned to death!"" We feel a deep and burning shame as we read such words from, we suppose, an English pen. We have long looked on the continued existence of Ashanti and Dahomey in power, for the perpetration of their hideous crimes against humanity, as a reproach to Great Britain.

The distance from the sea-coast of the human shambles of Ahomey and Kumassie is so trifling, and the results to be obtained in the cause of humanity were so momentous, that only the poca curante spirit which inordinate wealth has engendered among us stood in the way of our deliberate organization of means of suppression, by which little, if any, sacrifice of British life should need to have been made. Emboldened by long impunity at the very doors of our Gold Coast protectorate, Ashanti has now forced upon us in vindication of our national honour, that interference which we ought to have made as a matter of duty; and which, if so made, by pushing forward to the interior those material adjuncts and means of civilization—good roads—would have brought us profit as well as honour, without that accompanying loss of precious lives which we fear will attend our present action.

The coverings were silk, bamboo mats, and grass; and three ornaments—one like a vessel, one like an eagle, and one like a large umbrella tree—were put on the top of the three circular houses which we call monuments. At the front eight posts and cross-sticks were erected, and skulls and coral and other beads were hung on them. Smaller posts, similarly ornamented, were at the sides. On the day of the dedication almost everyone in the kingdom made presents to the king—gold coins, cowries, cloths, bullocks, sheep, goats, ducks, fowls, pigeons, palm-oil, &c. This also occupied about a week, and at the close of the presents the king produced six ornaments, some made in Europe and the others in Dahomey, in the form of hand lanterns, which were then shown to the assembly, the king saying that he had made them for his good father, who left him a large property to enjoy his kingship with. Three weeks after this he went on a war expedition, to some place of which we, the residents, are ignorant. He returned home unsuccessful, and of course, not being content at having come back empty-handed, made another expedition to five small places, which he broke, and caught all the people and brought them to Abomey. Now, lately, on the 20th inst., he made the gun custom, which ended yesterday. On this occasion all the captains swore in the large market that they would go to Abeokuta in four months' time and fight against the people there, and break the place, and catch every soul, and show them that the king has braver warriors yet than those whom the Abeokutans defeated in the last war. There is to be another custom shortly.—Yours faithfully,  \nD.\n\n---"", 'last_edit_date': '1868-06-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1868#article-27', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.637, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'How to Treat Dahomey', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""We observe by our English journals, received per Ethiope, that the friends of Africa in England are greatly bestirring themselves in favour of our country. We are glad to remark that the British Government have firm opinions as to the policy to be pursued with reference to the King of Dahomey. Some anti-slavery journals appear to deprecate the use of force towards that monarch. They think that persuasion and entreaty should be brought to bear on him, with a view to induce him to desist from his practices of sacrificing human beings and engaging in slave-hunts. Persuasion, argument, and entreaty, have been repeatedly used on this present King of Dahomey and his predecessors, and used in vain. These kings tell us that it is the custom of their nation to hunt for slaves and to sacrifice human beings. He who is king is obliged to do these things. It is with him just as much a duty as the abiding by the advice of responsible ministers is with the Sovereign of Great Britain. If he abstained from these practices, his subjects would turn him out, and set up another man in his place, who would carry them out in accordance with immemorial usage. In order to put down these barbarous practices, only one course will avail—to use physical force. The British Government must say to the Dahomians, \'Sir, you are unwholesome in your habits and troublesome in your ways and practices. You won\'t live and let live. You go about kidnapping and killing people who never harmed you—who don\'t even know you. You prevent commerce, you hinder civilization, you create misery and desolation, you break up hundreds of thousands of happy families. This will not do. The world really can\'t get on in this manner. We have spoken to you, we have reasoned with you, we have entreated you—nay, we have even offered you money to leave off troubling your neighbours. Well, you are obstinate, you are perverse; you won\'t listen to anything; you will continue killing, kidnapping, and plundering, for no other reason than because you like it. Now we are resolved to put an end to your proceedings. You shall keep the peace in future. You shall no longer be a bugbear, a nuisance, a terror and a scourge to all surrounding nations.

Several European friends went to visit Ibara and the site of the Dahomey camp on the Tuesday. The impression conveyed to them was that the Dahomans were not so strong as they have been thought to be; one person supposed them to have been not above 10,000 fighting persons, men and women. The camp, seen from Abeokuta, was only a part arranged in three single lines, with a considerable space between the end of one line and the beginning of another, as if to make the best possible appearance, if seen from a distance. The camp behind Ibara was larger, in which the King was present, for whom a superior dwelling was erected, as seen by the remains. One of those who went to see the spot, remarked that they were evidently in great fear, for their huts are everywhere a good gunshot off from Ibara bush, as if afraid it would give cover to an enemy. It was reported in Abeokuta that of some prisoners they had taken one had escaped, stating that the Dahomans pierced their hands or arms just above the wrist, and passed a cord through the wound, to tie them, and ensure their not getting free. One of the gentlemen who visited the site was desirous of testing the truth of this statement. He examined the body of a man, and found on his arm a wound above the wrist as described. Another individual was anxious to know whether the bodies had been otherwise maimed, as described to him, and verified its truth by inspection. One of the native Christians reporting that he had seen many dead bodies, headless corpses, but that they were chiefly old men, was asked how he could tell they were old. He remarked that their scalps were there, and the hair was grey. The Dahomans seek to secure skulls, and after beheading a man have a process of cleaning it, as the skull is the only valuable part. Thus their own friends who fall in battle are beheaded, and their skulls taken home. Who can distinguish between the skull of friend or foe? Several reports are rife as to the doings of the Dahomans after leaving this place. The first was that they had attacked and destroyed Ishala, a town in league with them, but it was not true, and again, that the Okeodan people and others had attacked them on their way home; but this also we believe to have no foundation in truth. Whilst they were at Ibara they destroyed several small towns in its neighbourhood; those named are Illewo, Kesson, and Ijalle. As mentioned before, the Ibara people were attacked by the Abeokuta people. It appears they were going off or coming to Abeokuta, that some of the Abeokuta and Ijaye people heard of it, and thinking to get plunder, went to meet them. They endeavoured to plunder; the Ibara people remonstrated and resisted. A fight ensued, in which many on both sides fell, including the Chief of Ibara, and they were captured. As soon as the chiefs of Abeokuta heard of it they were filled with indignation at the conduct of their people, and have used every means since to give liberty to every one thus taken. Sentence of death was passed on the individual who shot the Chief of Ibara.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH DAHOMEY?', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'whether anything among the ancient Aztecs, the remains of whose edifices are to be found in the forests of Central America, and who are believed to have been among the most inhuman of all heathen idolators, could possibly have surpassed the constant butcheries of Dahomey.

We do not mean that they would proceed to greater extremities in their horrible excesses and barbarous despotism than in the past; but that the time would come when the civilized countries of Europe, and Great Britain in especial, would rouse themselves from their inertia as regards Dahoman atrocities and outrages, and take some effective steps for curbing that savage will in which they have originated. The late visit of the British squadron under Commodore Sir William Hewett to the waters of Whydah, his inquiry into reported outrages committed at that place by the local authorities of the King of Dahomey upon the persons of certain British and French subjects employed in mercantile affairs there, and his imposition of a fine of 500 puncheons of oil, equivalent to the sum of £6,000, to be enforced by blockade if not paid before the end of June next, may be regarded as the first letters of “the handwriting on the wall” foretelling the destruction of a system the devilish action of which, both externally and internally, is at the present time a standing insult to humanity. It is the more significant of “the handwriting on the wall” by a supreme Divine Power, that this first step in the right direction by Great Britain as regards Dahomey should have been made, and most righteously made, by a British naval officer, after consultation with the Governor-in-Chief of the Gold Coast Colony, without any previous communication with, or any direct instructions from, Her Majesty’s Government, at the very time when the Government of France, acting under the malefic influence and representations of the old Marseilles slave-trade interests, should have made difficulties about the acquisition of Gambia, which it has so long and so mightily desired, because it was called upon, as one of the conditions, to relinquish any supposed claims it might have upon a worthless old fort at Whydah, formerly used by French slave-dealers as a slave depôt, and since as mercantile stores. It is, of course, only a logical sequence to what has been done at other parts of the West Coast of Africa, the so-called oil rivers and elsewhere, that the commander of a British squadron should thus inquire into outrages and injuries inflicted by native authorities on British merchants and their employés, impose and levy fines, and stop the trade of the place until those fines were paid. But the present is the first occasion on which this wholesome discipline has been brought to bear upon his Majesty of Dahomey, and we hope from it some very salutary results. Up to the time of our writing there has not been any intelligence received as to the emotions and intentions of the King that may have found expression in words or deeds when he heard of this fine of 500 puncheons of oil, and a blockade if it be not paid at a certain time. He was absent from his capital, engaged with his forces in their annual raid in the Egba countries, mention of which is made in our Abeokuta and Lagos news,—raids which ought not any longer to be permitted by Great Britain, as the interests of her settlement at Lagos are grievously injured thereby,—raids that may be effectually prevented by the cutting off from the King of Dahomey of those supplies of ammunition and other warlike stores which he receives through Whydah. But we fully expect to hear that one of his Majesty’s earliest commands has been the sacrifice of those Whydah authorities who committed the outrages complained of (and inquired into by Sir William Hewett) in their endeavours to satisfy the royal greed, which, as is well known to those acquainted with affairs on the West Coast of Africa, is insatiate, and ever looking to Whydah for renewed supplies. Next, we expect he will offer apologies, and point to his victims, the sacrificed and murdered authorities, as proof that all such deeds had been opposed to his principles, orders, and desires. But this will not do. Not one penny or one gallon of oil of the fine imposed by Sir William Hewett ought to be or can be remitted.

The statement of these men is somewhat alarming, and presents a new feature in the history of plunder and brutal treatment to persons which from time to time are reported to us as taking place on that river. The circumstances of the case are as follows: Towards the latter part of March last, Sallah, Corveh, and Siamah, traders, left Hortey, a small town in the vicinity of Quittah, under passport from the Government officer there, to proceed with three canoes, loaded with salt and cowries, to the Volta, bound for Salagha; on their way they landed at Engabee, a small town on the margin of the Volta, belonging to Dagado, King of Panto, in the Crepee country; and whilst in this place, a number of Houssa men, armed with guns, spears, bows, and arrows, having their drums beating, and headed by one Otuman Katto, came there; Otuman Katto then made them to understand, through the head men of Engabee, that he was authorized by his Excellency the Governor, by King Dagado, and by King Quajoe Dey, to prevent Ahwoonahs and Acquamoos going to Salagha; and that King Dagado and King Quajoe Dey having obtained the sanction of the white men to put to death all Ahwoonahs and Acquamoos who may come to their country, Sallah and his companions are to consider their heads as forfeited. At his command, these men were at once seized by the Houssas, and their hands held fast behind them to be bound, when the head men and people of Engabee interceded; a price was then set on them, and the sum of 330 heads of cowries, equal to 16l. 10s. sterling money, was paid to Otuman Katto, who then ordered them to return to their country. Such is the statement of these men. The Acquamoos men who were amongst them have also been plundered; but, for want of space, we are obliged to pass over that subject for the present. The question naturally presents itself, how long will such a state of things be allowed to continue in the Volta, and whether the Executive authorities on the Coast would not help to remove this evil in the way of trade?\n\nKing Dagado's territories are, in fact, not within the limits of the Protectorate, and the authorities on the Coast may be excused for taking no cognizance of offences which are committed in places beyond their jurisdiction; but the boldness and frequency with which these offences occur in the Volta, and the evil effects this may have on the trade there, demand the sympathy and interference of the authorities, for these offences are committed always by persons from the Coast, without the participation of the native chiefs."", 'last_edit_date': '1882-05-10', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

It wielded undisputed economic and political power over the coast and over the dependent kingdoms to the north. Towards the centre, kingdoms associated with the Oyoko clan from Kumasi gradually became subjugated and tributary on account of structural reforms carried out by Osei Kodjo, first, in the kingdom of Kumasi, and then at the expense of the neighbouring Akan kingdoms: Mampong, Nsuta, Dwaben, Bekwai, Kokofu, Bono, as also Denkyira, Ahafo, Sefwi, Adansi, etc. In this region, the Kumasihene (king of Kumasi) became the Asantehene. From this base, the Asante dynasty held political and economic sway over the coastal kingdoms (Wassa, Nzima, Twifu, Akwamu, Akyem, Akuapem, Ga and Adangbe), and more especially the coastal strip of the Fante chief› taincies. Similarly, to the north, the kingdoms of Gyaman, Gonja, Dagomba and Mamprusi came under the sway of Asante, sanctioned by a yearly tribute (ayibuade) of two thousand slaves, especially after the 1794 treaty.\nThe nineteenth century was to start with the reign of one of the greatest of the Asantehenes, Osei Bonsu (1801-24), whose victorious armies pushed through to the coast in a series of campaigns (1807, 1811 and 1814). The British, who at the time were caught up in the Napoleonic Wars and had no clear policy for their Gold Coast settlements, could not but recognize, through the President of the Council of Merchants, Colonel Torrane, and his successors, the reality of the suzerainty, or even sovereignty, of Asante over all the coastal peoples.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': ""However, with the Akan states the problem was essentially one of sovereignty. There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The Mono-Niger area as the unit of analysis', 'content': ""There are four main distinct, though evidently interrelated culture areas, comprising the Aja in the west, the Yoruba in the centre, the Borgu (pronounced Bohu) in the north and the Edo in the east.

But the new governors were overthrown and replaced by pre-existing dynasties during widespread revolts against his increasingly harsh rule. 20 The similarities between Liberia's and Ethiopia's political systems were too obvious from the analysis thus far to belabour. Besides possessing a core and periphery, and a central government, each had sub-political systems centred on local chiefdoms (or villages) like those of the Gola in Liberia or the Oromo ('Galla') in Ethiopia not discussed in this chapter, with political cultures more or less different from the dominant political culture at the centre. Both systems were solidly based on privilege at the core, and extensively utilized patronage and assimilation techniques.

It was thus: He built three round houses in one of the palace-yards, named Commasie. They were each ten feet in diameter; one was for his deceased father, one for the supposed deceased friend of his father, and one for the late king's mother, who died before him. The following tools and materials were given by the king for making the monument: 2 gold pickaxes, 2 silver ditto; 2 gold hoes, and 2 silver ditto; 2 gold trowels, and 2 silver ditto; 2 copper hoes, 2 brass ditto, and 2 iron ditto; 2 iron pickaxes, 2 copper ditto, and 2 brass ditto; 1 gold-gilt watering-pot, and 1 silver-gilt ditto; 24 puncheons of rum; some gold and silver coins; some coral and other kinds of beads; some pieces of silk damask (these were torn into small pieces); and the blood of forty human beings caught by the king in his wars. All these implements were equally divided between the two prime ministers, Mingah and Maywoo, for mixing the swish, and during the mixing he threw into the mixture two boxes of gold-dust, the coral and other beads, the silk pieces also, and the blood of the human beings. This work occupied about a week. The coverings were silk, bamboo mats, and grass; and three ornaments—one like a vessel, one like an eagle, and one like a large umbrella tree—were put on the top of the three circular houses which we call monuments. At the front eight posts and cross-sticks were erected, and skulls and coral and other beads were hung on them. Smaller posts, similarly ornamented, were at the sides. On the day of the dedication almost everyone in the kingdom made presents to the king—gold coins, cowries, cloths, bullocks, sheep, goats, ducks, fowls, pigeons, palm-oil, &c. This also occupied about a week, and at the close of the presents the king produced six ornaments, some made in Europe and the others in Dahomey, in the form of hand lanterns, which were then shown to the assembly, the king saying that he had made them for his good father, who left him a large property to enjoy his kingship with. Three weeks after this he went on a war expedition, to some place of which we, the residents, are ignorant. He returned home unsuccessful, and of course, not being content at having come back empty-handed, made another expedition to five small places, which he broke, and caught all the people and brought them to Abomey. Now, lately, on the 20th inst., he made the gun custom, which ended yesterday. On this occasion all the captains swore in the large market that they would go to Abeokuta in four months' time and fight against the people there, and break the place, and catch every soul, and show them that the king has braver warriors yet than those whom the Abeokutans defeated in the last war. There is to be another custom shortly.—Yours faithfully,  \nD.\n\n---""}, {'id': 3061, 'article_title': 'THE GOLD COAST.', 'full_section_title': 'THE GOLD COAST.', 'last_edit_date': '02-01-1876', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1876#article-22', 'issue_date': '01_02_1876', 'content': '\n\n**Whydah.** They promised to grant us this as soon as we were ready to depart. On the night of the 27th inst. Prince Gbo, who succeeded the King during his absence, called upon me where I put up. We sat in long conversation, and I seized an opportunity to direct it to the subject of religion, and asked him whether he would not like to have the Gospel preached in his country. Poor man! he could not understand what I meant by the terms ""preaching the Gospel,"" but after a little explanation he seemed to like it, but confessed that nothing of the kind could be allowed to be introduced into his country without the sanction of the King of Dahomey. On Monday morning, the 28th inst., having procured carriers, we left for the next station, about eight to twelve miles from Godome, where we hoped to procure a canoe for Whydah. Along the way from Godome to the wharf is occupied by an extensive course of water about three or four feet deep, and no stranger can get through without going by hammock. Accordingly I procured one, to be carried by four men. Leaving Godome at seven, we went through, and whilst two men bore the hammock upon their shoulders, the other two had to raise me up by the shoulders and waist, so as to prevent my being dragged along through the water: this occupies a course of about five to six miles\' distance. As there are many custom-houses by the way, to whose officers we were bound to pay tribute, my guide told me that we should endeavour to secure Prince Gbo\'s staff, as he is the senior officer of the customs, excepting those in the Whydah station; by this means we should pass along unmolested. I accordingly availed myself of the opportunity of securing this. It is three feet long, the head is carved exactly like a man\'s right hand held or stretched out. If a man hold out his right hand with his fingers stretched out he sees the staff to which I am alluding. I got to the next station early, about 9.30, for my carriers moved as fast as they could, and then waited for the rest of the carriers, who got to the station about eleven o\'clock. My guide then delivered the staff to the officer of this station—a wild and hungry-looking fellow of about fifty years of age. This man became angry on seeing this staff, because it prevented him from perpetrating his intentions. Notwithstanding this, he insisted upon the opening of my boxes. My guide, who is one of them, and knows their uncivil behaviour, told me to open them. I refused, alluding to the staff for my security. He then went and ransacked my guide\'s boxes and other luggage, deprived him of all his provisions, &c., seized and took away five of my mats which were to have covered me in the canoe, and told my guide to tell me I must pay something. I was obliged to make him a present of some money, besides the things he had seized, ere I was permitted to proceed. Having secured a canoe and men, we left this station for Whydah at 12.30. This is one of the principal stations of the King of Dahomey, in which a Wesleyan Society had flourished for some time. We had a pleasant voyage all along; but at length our canoe unfortunately ran upon a stump and narrowly escaped being capsized. On the morning of the 29th inst. I engaged a man to take me upon his shoulders, and had to walk about two hours in water three or four feet deep along the way to Whydah. As this is a chief station, we of necessity called here and obtained permission, else we would not be permitted to proceed. After visiting several persons in the place, and viewing other parts of the country, in which I noticed its populated state, the prosperity of trade, the beauty of the country itself, as well as its fine buildings, I thought what a sad thing indeed it is that a country possessed of such resources has not a single church or chapel to adorn or complete its beauty! As my guide told me we should get to my station the next day, or the third day at the longest time, and being resolved to proceed to Aguay that evening, I asked him to proceed with me to the palace of Prince Dinadu, and obtained permission to go away and get to my station in time. Accordingly we proceeded. But a minute or two before we left, Mr. Buko, our landlord, mentioned that he heard it noised abroad that the English Government were sending men as spies to Whydah. I told him I had heard nothing of the kind. Before this time it appears a similar report had gone forth informing the Prince that there are spies in the land; and, as we were bound to see him before we left, he was prepared also to meet us. Our landlord accompanied us to the palace of the Prince, who seemed to be exceedingly angry at our presence, and manifested a feeling totally unfriendly at the onset. Mr. Buko, our spokesman, knelt down, clapped his hands together several times, told him our mission, and besought him to grant us permission to pass to Little Popo, where we expect to begin our work. He inquired of me, through the interpreter, ""Why did not the Wesleyan Missionary Society build the chapel there before sending men to take possession of it?"" I said to my guide that there had been a chapel not only there, but even in Whydah, as well as Augway, &c., but these had been broken up. But for the good of the people and the instruction of the children this Mission wishes to renew these societies, and for this cause they sent me. On hearing this he was exasperated, and ordered us to return immediately by the way we came, and inform him by whom we were sent, that we have no permission or authority to proceed thither. All along from Dahomey beyond Popo is under the King\'s jurisdiction. Our Superintendent must write a letter of inquiry to the King of Dahomey and the princes or chiefs about his kingdom, so that due consideration might be given to the subject. As I had suffered a little from ill health shortly before I undertook my journey this way, I pleaded to obtain permission to have my course through Popo, not far from Whydah, so that I might return by the mail packet to Lagos, as the way through which I came to Whydah is rather tedious. Here he said he would not hear from me a word more, but I should return immediately by the way I came. He then called out, and a wild-looking gentleman presented himself, knelt down before him, and clapped his hands together several times. Upon his person we observed scores of keys suspended about his neck and waist. This he did to frighten me away. This individual I conjecture to be the keeper of the doors of the prison. On seeing this I became thoroughly convinced and satisfied that evil was determined upon, and that danger was at hand if I persisted. I beckoned to my guide and landlord, the latter kneeling and clapping his hands several times: we then bowed and retired from the palace. On returning to our landlord\'s house, we found him much troubled about this matter. We had thought at first to pass the night in Whydah, as the day was far gone; but having now found that we were becoming obstacles in the way of our landlord, we thought it most prudent to retire. There are scores of towns and villages situated on either side of the river which I saw on my way to Whydah. Also from Lagos up to Porto Novo we find scores of towns and villages on either side of the river. — *Wesleyan Magazine.*\n'}, {'id': 3620, 'article_title': 'Gold Coast', 'full_section_title': 'Gold Coast', 'last_edit_date': '07-05-1878', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1878#article-9', 'issue_date': '01_08_1878', 'content': 'The forces of the King of Gaman are reported to have obtained great successes in conflicts with those of the King of Ashanti.

The party includes the king\'s great chiefs, Chedingar and Ayumkuken; his messenger, Tassah; Mr. Henry Dasos, an interpreter, and Mr. John P. Jackson, editor of *The Lagos Record*. The chiefs stoutly deny that the King of Dahomey is the inhuman monster he has been represented to be. They affirm that no human sacrifices are offered in Dahomey, except at the annual ""Royal custom,"" which, however, has been suspended for the past four years. At this custom all the royal maidens are required to fetch water from the sacred streams of Golutar. This water is sprinkled in the royal mausoleum, after which sacrifices of sheep and oxen are made by the fetish priest, followed by a human sacrifice, the victim being commissioned to convey messages to the spirits of the deceased kings, and to invoke their guidance and protection for the throne and kingdom. The chiefs, in support of the foregoing, assert that of the 4,000 Yorubas captured in the last raid at Abeokuta four years ago, not one has been offered in sacrifice, and that it is a capital offence to shed human blood in Dahomey, and also that any chief or prince who would cause one of his servants to be beaten so that he fainted would be imprisoned for life. The chiefs were well pleased with the treatment and comfort they received on the voyage to England, and what they saw in the Liverpool streets and docks caused them great surprise.\n\nThese envoys took 21 days to get from Dahomey to Lagos on account of their adopting a circuitous route in order to avoid the French troops who are now operating in Dahomey. The Chief Chedingar takes to France the staff of King Behanzin, which is entirely made of silver, and represents the head of the sacred shark of Dahomey. This is the first time that this staff has ever left the country, and this is also the first occasion on which Dahomeyans have left Africa to treat with a civilised nation.\n\nThe envoys are represented to have declared that the King maintains that General Dodds deceived him, and he was\n[Dec. 4, 1893.]'}]","[{'document_title': 'More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""In about a week after this he started for Kanna, one of his chief towns, about eight miles east of Abomey, where he has a large palace.

It will be tedious to mention all the ceremonies; but on July the 2nd, which was a day only for the chiefs to hear the singers in their respective places, the King came out unexpectedly, having before him twelve Ayor people, holding in their hands a piece of silk damask and one piece of cotton shirting, went round the market three times, then came and sat himself about ten feet from where I was sitting, looking on the dancing and hearing the singing, and called audience, and told the reasons of what he had done; and that was, the former kings served the Nago Ayors, and paid heavy tribute yearly, and that those who were sent to collect the tribute were such extortioners, that they would claim nothing but silk damask and that kind of shirting. Such treatment all the former kings underwent, except his late father, who would not submit; he therefore turned to and fought them, and became conqueror over them.

The personal aspect of the matter is to us of little significance; and, probably, it is so to Dr. Horton himself, of whose personal merits the letter is not an unimportant record. Its chief value consists in unfolding of the laws and institutions of the powerful Negro kingdom, a feature which shows that the power of that kingdom is not based entirely upon a blind reverence for bodily strength and martial prowess. The Ashantees acknowledge the advantage of encouraging every virtue, the direction of which is to advance the interest of the country, by enlisting amongst the nobility any person who distinguishes himself in the patriotic display of every such virtue. It is no wonder that their warriors fight to death, with true Spartan bravery, when they know that the meanest subject may, by valour—which now furnishes the chief means for patriotic advancement of the interests of the kingdom—create for himself a position equal to that of the best born of the land. This system of ennobling the meritorious as a reward for public services, prevails somewhat amongst the Dahomans. It is a mistake, therefore, to suppose that it is the fear of death alone, from an enraged monarch, that moves either the Ashantee or Dahoman soldier to court death by brave deeds in war, rather than return home under an ignominious sense of defeat to meet a more ignominious death. Skertchly, in his book on Dahomey, states that he was made a peer of the realm by Gelele for his services in teaching the native soldiery the use of certain guns.

If he refers to the chiefs or cabboceers that he occasionally came into official contact with at Cape Coast, he is right for once, as these chiefs have less power than one of the petty traders in their towns; but there is no room to doubt that he alludes to his ""old correspondent,"" Quaku Duah, and his friend Badahung, in which case he is guilty of a direct falsification of facts.

About the period that the Rev. William West, the superintendent of the Wesleyan Mission on the Gold Coast, was at Coomassie on a visit to the King, in company with the Rev. John Osco Ansah (an Ashantee prince) and Mr. Ghartey, a report was brought to his Majesty that a woman in a neighbouring village had made use of his great oath without sufficient cause. Quaku Duah at once despatched his executioner with his staff to the said village with orders (I need not say *strict or positive orders*, as in Coomassie all orders are positive and irrevocable) to slay every man, woman, child, sheep, goat, dog, fowl, and living creature therein, and to raze the place to the ground, and scatter salt over the ruins. *These orders were executed literally.* For the truth of this I refer to the three gentlemen named above.

Behind is a fine specimen of one of Mr. Du Chaillu\'s gorillas. The main exhibits in the lower gallery are arranged geographically in the numerous panels around the walls. On one side spears are the most conspicuous objects, and the variety of type is quite striking. We have spears from Somaliland, the Masai country, the Congo, Uganda, Swaziland, the Nyassa region, the Tanganyika region. Nearly all of these spears, as well as the other exhibits, have been collected by explorers whose names are famous, men like Livingstone, Speke and Grant, Stanley and Thomson, Johnston, and many missionaries; the officials of the Congo Free State, and others. Very varied are the types of axes, many of them of elaborate form. Bows and arrows are not numerous; but shields are plentiful and varied, and it is of interest to note that the Zulu shield extends to the latitude of Zanzibar, where we find a tribe long settled there, and yet retain many of the old Zulu customs. Some of the personal ornaments are most extraordinary. There are anklets like enormous brass plates, with a hole through the centre; others made of bars of copper, each over a pound weight.

Certainly there is nothing in this line in the Centennial that may be placed beside them; and when it is considered that they were wrought with rude tools, that the artizans were native men, unskilled in civilized art; that they and their fathers from time immemorial have ever lived on the Gold Coast, that they are the manufacturers of the largest assortment of trinkets in the Centennial,—then it seems to me that these men,—the ""Ashantees,"" the ""Accras,"" the ""Fantees,"" the ""Denkras,"" the ""Wassaws,"" the ""Assins,"" &c.,—should not be deprived of the meed of praise which belongs to them, but should receive the just reward for their great genius and their native art. I therefore, as an African, of which I am proud, having been born, bred and educated on that Coast, feel called upon to make this explanation. On several occasions while visiting the Centennial, I spent some time in explaining to the ladies and gentlemen who crowded around me that these trinkets were made by the native Africans, and I took great pains to impress upon their minds the capability and ingenuity of the native Africans. I would like very much that the words West Africa should be placed under the words Gold Coast, for many persons will think that the Gold Coast is in Australia or California, and thus deprive Africa of her just merits. Give to all nations, tribes, and people what is due to them. As a native of Africa, I return my sincere thanks to his Excellency Governor Strahan, C.M.G., Governor-in-Chief of the Gold Coast Colonies, for his activity and energy in having that part of Western Africa represented in this great ""World\'s Fair.""—Yours,', 'last_edit_date': '1876-10-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1876#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.619, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'DAHOMEY: ITS KING AND PEOPLE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The King of Dahomey has not realized the expectations we last month hazarded respecting him. Those expectations were formed on the supposition that he might possess some few grains of common sense, which would place vividly before his mental vision the dangers of collision between an earthen pot and a sledge hammer wielded by an arm of power. It seems to be now past dispute that, instead of disowning the acts of the brutal authorities at Whydah, who showed themselves to be fit servants to such a master, he has put a bold front on the matter, and sent the insolent message that ""he will pay the Commodore in powder and bullets if he will come up to Abomey."" This is the language that might be expected only from a doomed idiot, vapouring among the spiritless slaves by whom he may be surrounded, and who have worshipped him as almost a god, until he believes himself to be quite one. It is clearly full time that both King and people should be undeceived by coming in rude contact with something more than a few European trading clerks and agents, who, naturally enough, in the interests of their trade, submit, uncomplainingly, to everything short of actual plunder and brutal violence. Our opinions and feelings respecting the frantic iniquity of Dahomey are so strong, and our conviction that it is the imperative duty of Great Britain, as the real protecting Power on the West Coast of Africa, to put a final end to its enormities as being a daily insult to humanity, is so unalterable, that all we can say in reply to the braggart King is that we hope he will continue in his present frame of mind, and not be moved to feigned repentance by the blockade of his sea-ports. We do not wish him to repent, and thus save himself and his authority from destruction—unless his repentance should go so far (which it never would do) as to secure his faithful acquiescence in British demands, that he should never henceforth make any inroads into Egba territories in search of victims for his atrocious festivals, and that those festivals of blood should be entirely put an end to. The earth has groaned long enough under this blood-thirsty monster, and the devilish system that he at this time represents. That system is incurable by any other means than the entire destruction of the Power with which it is identified, and of which it is an inseparable part. The late King, and the present also, more than once declared to Europeans who have been on missions to Abomey, that even were he desirous of doing so, he could not discontinue that perpetual series of human sacrifices in which his people delight; that his prestige would be gone, and that he in his turn would be a victim if he ceased to justify by deeds his title of ""Man-slayer."" There is possibly truth in this. The people, like their King, are accustomed to sniff the, to them, intoxicating odour of the reeking blood of victims slaughtered before their eyes, and would object to be deprived of a gratification they have so long enjoyed. Under such circumstances there is only one way of purifying the horribly polluted atmosphere of Dahomey, and that is by bringing a superior force to bear upon King, people, and institutions. As already stated, we have ourselves always held the opinion that it was the duty of a civilized Christian Power such as Great Britain to interfere in the interests of humanity. There are now other interests, in addition to those of mere humanity, urging and impelling to the work. Not only has one of her subjects been grievously maltreated, but the financial interests of the Gold Coast Colony are very prejudicially interfered with by the action of Dahomey as a marauding State. The yearly armed expeditions into the Egba territories, even up to the immediate neighbourhood of Abeokuta, in quest of plunder and victims for sacrifice in the ""Customs,"" inflict very great injury not only on the industrious Egba agriculturists, but also, as a necessary result, on the revenues of Lagos. There is an annual scare in the Egba territories. Farms are deserted, the people take refuge in Abeokuta, and their property is wasted and destroyed. We feel sure that we do not exaggerate when we say that were those marauding inroads to cease, and to cease at the absurd certainty that there will not be any renewal of them, agricultural industry will take so great a development in the Egba countries that the production would be doubled, with corresponding advantage to the', 'last_edit_date': '1876-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1876#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Present for the King of Abbeokuta', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A State chair and footstool, intended as a present from the African-Aid Society to the Alake of Abbeokuta, are now at the offices of the society, at 8, Adelphi-terrace, Strand.

One was a celebrated slavetrader, now dead; the other an equally well-known native merchant. The King of Dahomey, on a certain occasion, expressed a curiosity to ascertain the exact appearance presented by an infant whilst in the womb, and in order to gratify that diabolical curiosity, this religious monarch ordered one of his female subjects who was in an advanced state of pregnancy to be brought before him. I cannot write what followed, as it would be too disgusting; but suffice it to say, that the King, having satisfied his curiosity, exclaimed, ""Is that all?"" There are those still living that can corroborate this.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change.

While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': 'In the light of these considerations, no colonial power immediately sought to dispose completely of the socio-political structures already in place.

Belgian and Portuguese colonialism, as well as British settler colonialism in East Africa, are easily recognized as the most ruthless on the continent. They created conditions for the truly displaced African in the most literal sense of the word. The Arabic dimension was unique in its own right, an ambivalent face of expansionism which none the less left strong cultural impressions on the landscape.

In Haiti, for example, where the black population is in the majority, a characteristically African religion was influenced by the structural realities of Haitian society and the role of the half-castes, and underwent a series of changes set in motion by new \'gods\' that met the requirements of the new situation. In the neighbouring islands, as a result of Protestant mission work, a \'black culture\' had already taken shape in various movements such as that of the Rastafarians (a Messianic wave of reaction against the white overlord in which African imagery was thinly veiled, Haile Sellassie being cast as Messiah). On the other hand, in Jamaica, with the Sasabonsan cult, of Asante origin, elements of \'African culture\' persisted during that historical period, subsequently vanishing to give way to spirit-based cults involving a large dose of magic, as was the case in 1894 of the \'Jamaica Baptist Free Church\', a sect founded by Bed ward.\nIn those parts of the Americas exposed to the teachings of Catholicism, a form of syncretism based on the co-existence of European and African cultural features arose.

Particularly telling was a defiant McKay poem, later used without credit by Winston Churchill during the Battle of Britain, called 'If We Must Die'.

It is believed to branch off from the Niger, but the natives are so jealous of Europeans proceeding any distance into the interior, that it has never been explored, and nothing is really known of it beyond a few miles from its mouth. It is a good wide river where it falls into the sea, so that probably, if it is a branch of the Niger, it receives in its way to join the sea some streams. The repugnance the natives entertain to white men exploring their country does not issue from any dislike to the white men as such, but to a belief that if once the country is explored, the white men will flock to the interior, get at the markets, and so put an end to the trade of the middlemen, who at present purchase the oil up-country and bring it to the coast, making a handsome profit out of the transaction. There are about eight trading houses here, all of them English, and trade appears to be very brisk. Palm oil and kernels are, of course, the chief exports. The houses of the traders are situated together close to the mouth of the river, and they are picturesque in the extreme, constructed, of course, of wood, with roofs of corrugated iron, each house having a pier, godowns, and store-rooms in close proximity, so that the whole looks exactly like a miniature colony. Most of the traders have constructed tiny gardens in front of their residences, wherein they grow some of the choicest of the tropical plants intermingled with English roses, which form an attractive oasis in the dense masses of jungle and mangrove swamps with which each bank of the river is overgrown. The native town, at which the king resides, is distant some four miles up the river, and covers a considerable amount of space. Ja Ja has gone in heavily for the ""resources of civilization."" He has had a large banqueting hall built, decorated and furnished in the most tawdry fashion: here a huge banquet is spread every day for such of the chiefs and their retainers as may care to partake of it, and here also the king entertains any white men who may visit his capital, and who are invited in due course to partake of ""chop,"" the native designation for a meal of any kind. To a person of English tastes, the viands, though plentiful in quantity, are not inviting: mysterious and unwholesome-looking dishes of native manufacture, enormous dishes of fish and goat stored in filthy-looking grease, and flavoured with the inevitable palm wine, do not have an invigorating effect on the stomach. Palm oil wine, a somewhat insipid beverage, with a taste in some measure approximating to home-made ginger beer, appears to be the chief native drink. The king does not, however, stint his guests to the wine of the country. Every description of European liquor is at their disposal. Ja Ja himself does not drink intoxicating fluids. ""They make man fool"" is his laconic description of their effect; and as the king is neither a fool nor has he any wish to become one, he is probably right to abstain from them. The house is neither particularly clean nor particularly dirty. Both the king and the principal chiefs have European built houses, and live more or less in European style. Ja Ja is a despotic monarch, and rules his people with a rod of iron, after a somewhat rough-and-ready fashion. A short time since he was disturbed in his slumbers one afternoon by a noisy disturbance which was taking place in close proximity to the royal palace between the retainers of two of his chiefs. The king got up, took down a Winchester repeating rifle, and shot dead with his own hands two of the obstreperous party, pour encourager les autres. There is no standing army, but nearly all the able-bodied men are trained to arms, and the king has three Gatling guns and some Armstrong field pieces, of which he is exceedingly proud. He is frequently engaged in war with neighbouring kings, and, as a rule, comes off the victor on these occasions. The prisoners taken in battle are killed and eaten. This is the only occasion upon which human flesh is indulged in. This, however, is not a custom incidental to Ja Ja alone, but appears to be the recognized method of warfare among the kings in this part of the world. The most powerful personage in the kingdom after the king is his ""prime minister,"" a negress rejoicing in the name of Emma Johnson, who, born a Kentucky slave, afterwards migrated to Liberia, and eventually, after a somewhat chequered career, arrived at Ja Ja\'s kingdom, where, being a shrewd woman, nimble at her pen, she has acquired an extraordinary amount of power, and has more influence over the king than any one else. [In our last number we directed our readers\' attention to some of the vagaries of this lady.] The greater portion of the income of both kings and chiefs is derived from the sale of palm oil, which they obtain up-country and dispose of to the English traders. Besides this, Ja Ja receives a duty of one per cent. on all oil exported from the river, and some other duties besides; so that his income is computed to be not less than £10,000 a year, a prodigious sum for a petty African king. Ja Ja has 200 wives. His eldest son and heir to the throne is being educated at a school in Liverpool, where he has been for a considerable time past, so that when he succeeds his father he will utilize his English education for the advancement of his country, and not as some other of those young native princes who were educated at home, and who have become more barbarous, blood-thirsty, and cruel to Europeans when they return to their native country, and throw over the burdensome restraints of civilization. Now that Ja Ja\'s country has been placed under English protection, it is to be hoped some of the cruelties and atrocities which, it is much to be feared, are not of infrequent occurrence, will be put a stop to. Ja Ja is a shrewd monarch, and as he is all-powerful and has no rivals, it only requires a little judicious pressure to induce him to govern his kingdom on somewhat less rough-and-ready principles than is now the case. The king has been of late endeavouring to ship palm oil to England on his own account, by which he can get about double the price he does out here. Up to the present, however, the traders have been too much for him in this respect, and the steamship companies, induced by them, will not take it on freight. The king, however, is not likely to be long baulked in his project: he can always bring a little gentle pressure to bear on the traders by stopping the oil supply. On the whole, Ja Ja himself, his capital, and his country, are interesting in the extreme. There is capital shooting here—elephants, crocodiles, hippopotami, and leopards, within easy reach too, so that a lover of sport finds his hands full.—*Times of India.*'}, {'id': 5451, 'article_title': 'An African Palaver', 'full_section_title': 'An African Palaver', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1886#article-5', 'issue_date': '01_12_1886', 'content': 'The traders next brought forward an accusation against the King of firing on their boats when proceeding through a creek to the Bonny River with their mails, but Ja Ja most solemnly asseverated that he had no cognizance of this, and that the outrage had been perpetrated by a tribe which was not under his jurisdiction. The traders, however, stated that they would be able to prove the attack had been incited and abetted by the King, and the matter was therefore postponed until the Consul\'s next visit to allow of further evidence being procured. The European residents then produced a charge against Ja Ja of imposing exactions upon them which were not according to treaty, but which have, as far as it was possible to ascertain, been acquiesced in for years with equanimity, and to have been almost legalized by custom. These ""exactions"" consisted of a tribute to the value of about £50 from each new agent arriving in the river. The Consul, however, found that any such tax was not according to treaty, and, consequently, illegal, and he ordered that all such exactions from the imposition of the tax until the present time should be refunded to the representatives of the trading firms by whom they were paid. This means, at the very lowest computation, a sum of about £2,000. I must say the King does not in all these transactions appear to have been treated with generosity, or his position as a factor in African civilization sufficiently recognized. So long as trade flourished and the profits were large he was petted and pampered, and his whims gratified by the European traders; but now that state of transient prosperity no longer exists, principally through a universal cause or causes—competition, and consequently over-production—and the King has begun to discover that he can get better value for his produce by shipping it direct to England, he is treated with contumely, is heavily fined, and his territory is invaded against treaty rights.\n\nOne of the most interesting sights at the palaver was Ja Ja\'s son and heir—a boy about fourteen years of age, who has just returned from England, where he has been at school for some years past. He was arrayed in the orthodox tunic and knickerbockers inseparably connected with our schoolboy days, speaks English perfectly, and has perfect manners. He, however, wears the peacock\'s feather in his hat which indicates that he has ""killed his man.""

King Ja Ja, so far from attempting to monopolize the trade, has been fighting the battle of the native traders, his subjects. It is all a question of getting rid of the middleman. When trade is depressed the buyer wishes to deal directly with the seller, without the intervention of a broker. King Ja Ja and his merchants are the brokers between the producers of palm oil in the interior and the merchants who export the oil from the coast. The European traders wish to trade direct, just as we natives would like to trade direct with the manufacturers in this country. But we are not allowed; for we are compelled to submit to the brokerage charges of English middlemen. The European merchants on the coast consented to pay brokerage or commission to King Ja Ja for all oil which they bought from him, but they refused to pay commission to the native merchants, who were doing business side by side with the King. Ja Ja refused to separate his interests from those of his subjects, and insisted upon the maintenance of the treaty. It is to punish this that he has been first fined and then deposed.\'\n\n""Editor: \'Have any steps been taken to bring this matter before the Government?\'\n\n""Deputation: \'Yes; King Ja Ja sent his son and three of his chiefs to England to represent the matter before the Foreign Secretary; but they could get no answer except that Admiral Grubb would investigate the matter. When they were absent from Opobo, the traders sent for Consul Johnston, who invited King Ja Ja to a friendly meeting at Harrison\'s Beach. When King Ja Ja, relying upon the good faith of the Consul, came to the meeting, he was arrested and carried away to the Gold Coast, where he still remains, surrounded by people who cannot speak his own language, and unable to communicate his grievances to those who are sitting in judgment upon him. Consul Johnston has trampled under foot the rights of treaties, and even the ordinary usages of savage nations, in his arrest of a protected King, who accepted his apparently friendly invitation only to find himself made a prisoner and carried away from his own country. This is not honest, neither is it honest the way in which Consul Johnston goes on suppressing my trade, for instance (said one member of the deputation), and saying that he does so because of orders from home. When I came here to ask why the orders have been issued, they tell me there are no orders; Consul Johnston has never been instructed to suppress my trade. Why treat us in this way? Is this just? Is this true? Why do you make us feel that you have no respect for treaty or the rights of any persons but yourselves? You would not let us trade without middlemen. Why should you depose our King because he protects the rights of his subjects who are middlemen?

Some extracts from the conversation which then took place we append for the interest of our readers:—\n\n""\'I ask,\' said the first of these natives, \'I ask for justice—justice for King Ja Ja. He is but a heathen; he cannot speak one word of English. He, a sovereign, is a prisoner far away from his home—a prisoner, because he trusted in you and in the word of your representative.

How has King Ja Ja been treated unjustly, and what is the breach of faith of which you have reason to complain?\'\n\n""Deputation: \'King Ja Ja of Opobo is a Sovereign with whom England has concluded a treaty as lately as 1887. The first treaty was that of 1873, which gave Ja Ja power to fine all European traders who attempted to trade beyond certain defined limits in his territory. The treaty of 1884, concluded after the Berlin Congress, established a protectorate over Opobo. All went well until 1886, when, trade in palm oil being depressed, traders wished to get rid of the middlemen and trade directly beyond the districts opened to Europeans in Opobo. To this King Ja Ja objected. Consul Hewitt had assured him that by the protectorate the Queen did not want to take his country or his markets; that she had no wish to disturb his rule. Nevertheless, because King Ja Ja refused to allow the European traders to break the express terms of his treaty by trading directly in the reserved region, he has been first fined, then his trade has been destroyed, and lastly, he has been arrested under circumstances of great treachery by Consul Johnston, and carried off a prisoner to the Gold Coast. This in Africa is injustice, and I am come to ask if you consider it justice in England.\'\n\n""Editor: \'But did not King Ja Ja try to establish a monopoly of trade for himself, excluding the traders from advantages to which they were entitled by treaty?\'', 'last_edit_date': '1888-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1888#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Massacre and Cannibalism in Opobo', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""This river has recently been the scene of great atrocities. Ja Ja, whose name is well known as that of the successful rebel chief who some years ago, in conjunction with his party, retired to this place, where, being nearer to the palm oil producing markets, and commanding all the creeks from Bonny river leading thereto, with the aid of two mercantile houses whom he induced to support him, he eventually obtained terms which gave him an ascendancy over his opponents, and secured to this river the larger portion of the trade which had previously been carried on in Bonny alone. His position here is now one of great power, and his will is law. He possesses a number of Krupp and other guns, both breech and muzzle loading, and is well supplied with Snider and other breech-loading rifles. There are some half-dozen British commercial houses established here doing business with him and his people, who act as intermediate agents between them and the producers of the staple article of commerce—palm oil. He prohibits all intercourse between the Europeans and the producers, although they are but a few miles apart, enjoying thereby a monopoly by which he is enabled to build up his power, which he at times exercises in the most arbitrary manner towards both natives and Europeans. Of the latter he allows only such as he chooses to engage in trade with his people, and if those established incur his displeasure he prohibits their trading (through the influence he possesses over his own people) until they enforce obedience to his views. About half way between Opobo and the Old Calabar rivers runs the river Qua Ebo, in which a Scotch house formerly did business. A house trading in Old Calabar recently determined to open trade in the Qua Ebo, and entered into negotiations with the principal natives there, who allotted a site near the mouth of the river for the purpose of building a factory, which has since been erected and preparations made for opening trade with them. Ja Ja, hearing of this, sent messengers with presents to the Qua Ebo people, requesting them to trade with him rather than with the European house. These presents were not accepted by the natives, who stated their desire to do business with white men, as they had previously done. It must be remembered that these people owe no allegiance to Ja Ja, and in his treaties with the British Government he has no recognised authority over this part of the coast. The natives of the Qua Ebo have a river of their own quite distinct from the Opobo. The land about it is comparatively high, and the whole country is covered with palm-trees, so that they are able both to produce the oil themselves and to act as intermediary agents between the European merchant and the natives dwelling higher up their river and creeks. Having little or no trade they are a poor defenseless people, completely at the mercy of men armed with modern artillery and firearms. Ja Ja, without any warning, sent his headmen with some fifty canoes, full of men armed to the teeth, and, dragging them over the flats which separate the creeks of the two rivers, they suddenly pounced upon the unprotected dwellers on the banks of the Qua Ebo, who, innocent of any cause of offence, and unprepared for any attack, were dismayed to find themselves the object of Ja Ja's wrath and fiery vengeance. Early in the morning of the 11th April the havoc began, and the poor wretches, having no means of defence, were either shot down or saved their lives by immediate flight into the woods. Their enemies burnt down their towns, destroyed their farms, and seized all their cattle, and whatever else they could lay their hands on and carry away. Seven villages were thus attacked and destroyed, and the people, scattered and homeless, roamed about the woods for days without food, not daring to venture near the river lest their merciless persecutors might still be in the neighbourhood. Ja Ja's people went to the recently-built factory and vented their rage upon it to the extent of bursting open the door, and scattering the few things inside, but the person in charge (an old Calabar native there temporarily) had prudently taken his departure at the commencement of the firing, rightly concluding the raiders were equally his enemies. The victorious conquerors of a people without arms, after firing and looting the towns, returned with their booty to the Opobo, taking along with them 100 men, women, and children, whom they had caught. These unfortunate creatures they most barbarously slaughtered in cold blood, under circumstances of the most revolting cruelty. Their heads and limbs were seen afterwards about Opobo town, in which a horrible sickening stench, arising from the uncooked remains of the slaughtered prisoners, poisoned the air for days, no attempt being made to hide the evidences of their horrid deeds from the Europeans who had occasion to enter the town and who had appealed in vain to Ja Ja to spare them. But it is a proof of his arbitrary power, and of their weakness or fear of opposing his and his people's barbarity, that their influence extended only to the salvation of a few young girls. Women are the chief property of the savage African, and, seeing that their cupidity overcame their ferocity in the saving of these girls, it is greatly to be regretted that the Europeans did not unite to attempt the ransom of the lives of the others. If an African wants to create a quarrel or commit a crime he has never any difficulty in finding an excuse for it. Ja Ja gives as a reason for this execrable deed that some years ago the Qua Ebo people killed one of his men, but anyone who knows his cunning treachery and ferocity will know also that such an outrage by such people would not have been allowed by him to remain for years unsettled, and that he only brings it\n**77**"", 'last_edit_date': '1881-05-06', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1881#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.634, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Progress on the West African Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The rivers are connected by a network of cross creeks, being indeed one delta; so from the Opobo Ja Ja\'s people found their way to the interior oil markets, and the oil trade of Opobo was established.

Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets. Ja Ja was made prisoner by Consul Johnstone, and carried off to Accra. An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river. He will, however, be allowed an annual pension of £800 for life.\n\nThe principle having been laid down that Europeans may trade in the interior, it becomes imperative to assume definite authority over the district.

Whether things will remain as they now are is the doubtful point; pretexts for occupation are so easily found when wanted that it would be rash to answer. Some tribe is reached who cannot understand dual control; they insist on customs, perhaps; are ""chastised"" by the Consul; they retaliate, and finally an occupation is proclaimed.

One of the conditions of the treaty which Ja Ja signed (Article 6) expressly prohibited strangers going to the interior markets; this condition being further substantiated by a letter from the Consul to Ja Ja; the effect and intention of this being to secure that the European agents should only obtain their goods from the interior through Ja Ja and his chiefs.\n\nAbout two years ago, owing to the depression in the oil trade, some of these agents agreed among themselves that the price of the oil and other native productions should be reduced; and Ja Ja accordingly was communicated with upon the subject, and he expressed his readiness to accept their terms; but that the ""topside"" (a general term among the traders there, meaning commission) should be allowed to him and his chiefs, as before. This the agents would not agree to; they were willing to continue the usual topside to Ja Ja himself, but not to his chiefs. Ja Ja remonstrated with them, and pointed out that Opobo was made by himself and his chiefs. Immediately a white flag was hoisted in five of the factories, which meant that they stop all further business with the natives. One of the firms concerned refused to agree to this suspension, and continued to trade as before.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1887#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Progress on the West African Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The African rivers situate in the Bight of Benin, commonly known as the Oil Rivers, have been placed under the protectorate of Great Britain.

Since the abolition of the export of slaves, these localities have been the sites of trading stations, palm oil being the chief article of export. The traders have been, with few exceptions, British, and the capitalists mostly Liverpool merchants. The natives allowed trading hulks to be anchored and commerce conducted on payment of fixed sums, known as ""comey."" Bonny, Brass, and Old Calabar are among the oldest of these trading ports, the native chiefs being also the native traders. They possessed numerous slaves who were sent with merchandise to the interior markets to collect oil, which was brought to the stations and sold to the whites. Among the Bonny chiefs was the father of Ja Ja, late King of Opobo; his son was brought up to the management of the business, and on his father\'s death he succeeded to his position. Of his enemies the most powerful was Oko Jumbo, who lost no opportunity to humiliate him. The Europeans could only let matters take their course; they regretted constant fighting of Oko Jumbo and Ja Ja, but the relations between the Europeans and natives being strictly commercial, nothing could be done.

It is believed to branch off from the Niger, but the natives are so jealous of Europeans proceeding any distance into the interior, that it has never been explored, and nothing is really known of it beyond a few miles from its mouth. It is a good wide river where it falls into the sea, so that probably, if it is a branch of the Niger, it receives in its way to join the sea some streams. The repugnance the natives entertain to white men exploring their country does not issue from any dislike to the white men as such, but to a belief that if once the country is explored, the white men will flock to the interior, get at the markets, and so put an end to the trade of the middlemen, who at present purchase the oil up-country and bring it to the coast, making a handsome profit out of the transaction. There are about eight trading houses here, all of them English, and trade appears to be very brisk. Palm oil and kernels are, of course, the chief exports. The houses of the traders are situated together close to the mouth of the river, and they are picturesque in the extreme, constructed, of course, of wood, with roofs of corrugated iron, each house having a pier, godowns, and store-rooms in close proximity, so that the whole looks exactly like a miniature colony. Most of the traders have constructed tiny gardens in front of their residences, wherein they grow some of the choicest of the tropical plants intermingled with English roses, which form an attractive oasis in the dense masses of jungle and mangrove swamps with which each bank of the river is overgrown. The native town, at which the king resides, is distant some four miles up the river, and covers a considerable amount of space. Ja Ja has gone in heavily for the ""resources of civilization."" He has had a large banqueting hall built, decorated and furnished in the most tawdry fashion: here a huge banquet is spread every day for such of the chiefs and their retainers as may care to partake of it, and here also the king entertains any white men who may visit his capital, and who are invited in due course to partake of ""chop,"" the native designation for a meal of any kind. To a person of English tastes, the viands, though plentiful in quantity, are not inviting: mysterious and unwholesome-looking dishes of native manufacture, enormous dishes of fish and goat stored in filthy-looking grease, and flavoured with the inevitable palm wine, do not have an invigorating effect on the stomach. Palm oil wine, a somewhat insipid beverage, with a taste in some measure approximating to home-made ginger beer, appears to be the chief native drink. The king does not, however, stint his guests to the wine of the country. Every description of European liquor is at their disposal. Ja Ja himself does not drink intoxicating fluids. ""They make man fool"" is his laconic description of their effect; and as the king is neither a fool nor has he any wish to become one, he is probably right to abstain from them. The house is neither particularly clean nor particularly dirty. Both the king and the principal chiefs have European built houses, and live more or less in European style. Ja Ja is a despotic monarch, and rules his people with a rod of iron, after a somewhat rough-and-ready fashion. A short time since he was disturbed in his slumbers one afternoon by a noisy disturbance which was taking place in close proximity to the royal palace between the retainers of two of his chiefs. The king got up, took down a Winchester repeating rifle, and shot dead with his own hands two of the obstreperous party, pour encourager les autres. There is no standing army, but nearly all the able-bodied men are trained to arms, and the king has three Gatling guns and some Armstrong field pieces, of which he is exceedingly proud. He is frequently engaged in war with neighbouring kings, and, as a rule, comes off the victor on these occasions. The prisoners taken in battle are killed and eaten. This is the only occasion upon which human flesh is indulged in. This, however, is not a custom incidental to Ja Ja alone, but appears to be the recognized method of warfare among the kings in this part of the world. The most powerful personage in the kingdom after the king is his ""prime minister,"" a negress rejoicing in the name of Emma Johnson, who, born a Kentucky slave, afterwards migrated to Liberia, and eventually, after a somewhat chequered career, arrived at Ja Ja\'s kingdom, where, being a shrewd woman, nimble at her pen, she has acquired an extraordinary amount of power, and has more influence over the king than any one else. [In our last number we directed our readers\' attention to some of the vagaries of this lady.] The greater portion of the income of both kings and chiefs is derived from the sale of palm oil, which they obtain up-country and dispose of to the English traders. Besides this, Ja Ja receives a duty of one per cent. on all oil exported from the river, and some other duties besides; so that his income is computed to be not less than £10,000 a year, a prodigious sum for a petty African king. Ja Ja has 200 wives. His eldest son and heir to the throne is being educated at a school in Liverpool, where he has been for a considerable time past, so that when he succeeds his father he will utilize his English education for the advancement of his country, and not as some other of those young native princes who were educated at home, and who have become more barbarous, blood-thirsty, and cruel to Europeans when they return to their native country, and throw over the burdensome restraints of civilization. Now that Ja Ja\'s country has been placed under English protection, it is to be hoped some of the cruelties and atrocities which, it is much to be feared, are not of infrequent occurrence, will be put a stop to. Ja Ja is a shrewd monarch, and as he is all-powerful and has no rivals, it only requires a little judicious pressure to induce him to govern his kingdom on somewhat less rough-and-ready principles than is now the case. The king has been of late endeavouring to ship palm oil to England on his own account, by which he can get about double the price he does out here. Up to the present, however, the traders have been too much for him in this respect, and the steamship companies, induced by them, will not take it on freight.

The state of those so-called Oil Rivers has long been weighing heavily on our heart, because it has become so evident that mere commercial intercourse with them, will do little or nothing towards the emancipation of their people from the beastly and loathsome superstitions and habits, to which they have become enslaved.

Commerce alone will not effect it; missionary teaching alone, without a basis of civilized power to rest upon, will not effect it.

This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects.

The incursions of Zwangendaba, for example, are generally credited with destroying the badly divided Rozwi kingdom of Changamire, while the division of the Barue state into two competing factions, coupled with the debilitating Gaza raids, enabled the Goan adventurer Gouveia to usurp temporarily the Barue throne around 1875. 97 Gouveia's success was part of a larger process by which Yao, ArabSwahili, Chikunda and Nguni invaders took advantage of the power vacuum to impose conquest states.

Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

The explanation for this lies partly in the fact that colonial territories were acquired in different ways, at different points in time, and therefore had different experiences of colonialism, lasting for varied lengths of time. Factors which conditioned the form and intensity of action by nationalists (wanasiasa) in the colonies included the type of leadership, the variations in the spread and intensity of European influences in the form of ideas and institutions; the number and significance of the settler (white) population; and, lastly, the colonial ideologies and practices.\nIn nearly all cases, the nationalist movements and the attendant colonial politics were led and dominated by the new western-educated elites who were the best equipped to understand the European political culture and therefore to react effectively to the colonial regimes on the terms enunciated by the latter. Sometimes, they co-operated actively with members of the 'traditional' leadership elites, even if there were tensions in their relations. Such co-operation features in territories like the Gold Coast with the Aborigines Rights Protection Society, in Southern Nigeria, Morocco, and among the Gikuyu of Kenya. In some cases, leadership remained within the ranks of the 'traditional' elites as in Libya and Morocco.

Where the administra› tions were regional in structure and/or policy, as in the French colonial federations, the African leaders tended to adopt a regional outlook. Hence, champions of African nationalism in the inter-war period (wanasiasa as they are known in Swahili) have been referred to as being primarily panAfricanists rather than nationalists in the European sense. The point was that nationalism was taking a reverse course to the expression of the same phenomenon in Europe. Contrary to what happened in Europe, the state was created before the cultural nations that would make it a meaningful political community were welded together. It is in this sense that one should take James Coleman's observation that: ... the drive behind African nationalism in many instances is not the consciousness of belonging to a distinct politico-cultural unit which is seeking to protect or assert itself, but rather it is the movement of racially-conscious modernists seeking to create new political and cultural nationalities out of the heterogenous people within the artificial boundaries imposed by the European master ... '\nWe must recognize that colonialism, as a system of relations, rests upon some kind of racialism, and that since development in a colonial situation is a product of interactions between the colonizer and the colonized, racial consciousness is basic to the growth of nationalism as a search for sovereignty and independence.\nThat African nationalists are regarded as 'modernists' is a reflection of the fact that they were operating within an externally defined setting which imposed alien systems of values, norms, and definitions of political and social developments to which they had to subscribe as a condition for success. That nationalism in Africa is a dynamic, ongoing phenomenon is clear from the extensive literature on themes like nation-building and irredentism.

It is quite clear, too, that Whobay was sent by his lawful heads to whom he owed the obedience of a subject; and it is manifest, too, that Bundukah was the recognised chief of Gondomah, at least to the rulers of the Impereh country, and as such recognised chief he was held liable for all his acts.\n\nIt may be mentioned that this witness, Yandi Bundoo, was produced on behalf of the Crown. He was one of the war party sent by the King and chiefs of the Impereh country to capture Gondomah. Some portion of the evidence of Mr. Thomas Ashford Peters must be quoted too, for it bears directly upon our subject matter. This witness was also produced on behalf of the Crown. He says:—\n\nBundukah, Chief of Gondomah, governed that town; there was no British local authority residing in the town of Gondomah.\n\nThus we are borne out in our statement that no protection was afforded these people, who had given their land to this Government. Mr. Peters is a British subject born in this colony, and is an intelligent man, so that when he tells us that Bundukah governed the town, we must receive it as being conclusive.

I would apply to the Chief of Gondomah for satisfaction, but if he could give me none, I would go to Capt. Walshe, for he is the man that has power.

This witness was also produced on behalf of the Crown.\n\nThat Whobay is a son of one of the Chiefs of the Impereh country; that the King and chiefs of that country, whose subject he is, sent him to make war on the town of Gondomah; that the alleged murders were committed during the war and in strict obedience to the orders of those by whom he had been sent—if any such murders took place at all—are all facts which cannot be controverted. It is also a fact established by evidence, that after Gondomah was ceded to the Queen of England, the chief of the place was allowed to remain in authority; and, probably, taking advantages of his position, picked a fresh quarrel with the neighbouring tribes which led to this war.""}, {'id': 1958, 'article_title': 'SUPPLEMENT—Trial of Whobay', 'full_section_title': 'SUPPLEMENT—Trial of Whobay', 'last_edit_date': '10-21-1870', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1870#article-20', 'issue_date': '23_12_1870', 'content': ""1.

His (Emin Pasha's) friends in Europe, concerned at his long sojourn in Africa and at the dangers which he ran, were sending him provisions and fresh supplies, and these were being brought to Wadelai by the expedition which Mr. Stanley commanded. As for the mission of Tippoo Tib, that, Emin Pasha explained, had doubtless to do with the government of the Congo, and was in no way connected with that of Mr. Stanley. Finally, on dismissing the envoys, the Pasha intrusted to them a personal communication from himself to M'wanga, and also some presents for the King.\n\nThis communication, when it reached that monarch's hands, produced an excellent effect. He had previously, despite the urgent representations of the missionaries, mobilized a great part of his forces, and had concluded alliances with the neighbouring chiefs, with whom he had before been at war; but on hearing the intelligence from Emin Pasha he abandoned his preparations. It appears that it was his intention to advance with his troops to the south of the Albert Nyanza, and to reach, if possible, the smaller stations established by Emin Pasha on the lake.\n\nWhen Emin Pasha sent his reply to M'wanga he was at Wadelai awaiting news of the relief expedition either from Mr. Stanley direct or from one of the two parties he had sent forward to meet the expedition.

The rising is still not suppressed; in fact, fighting between the insurgents and the Government troops is almost of daily occurrence. Some few weeks since the natives attacked a post and killed the Commandant. The rising did not take place in Bulama, which is an island, but on the mainland, in the Bissao River, which is about fifteen miles from the island of Bulama, and about 220 miles north from here. It is hard to say what the grievance of the people is. The statement of the Portuguese officials is that the people have nothing to complain about. Some time ago the Telegraph Station there wired to Sierra Leone for assistance, as they were afraid of being attacked, but when her Majesty's ship Sparrow got there, it was found that the alarm had subsided, and not being required, she left. A Hamburg firm established there also asked for assistance from the Foreign Office at Berlin, and in reply a German gunboat, the Hyaene, was sent from Cameroon to protect German interests, if necessary.\n\nA private wire from Bissao stated that the Portuguese tried to come to some arrangement with the insurgents, but failed. As a preliminary, the rebels demanded the heads of four officers. Of course, there being no likelihood of such a concession being made, the palaver was broken off. The natives of that part of the coast are a fine race of men, and fight well. Regular troops will have to be sent out from Lisbon before peace and quietness are re-established. So far, they have not attacked any factories or trading stations belonging to foreigners. This is rather unusual, as in most disturbances the natives generally plunder the trading stations in the first instance.\n\nWith regard to the origin of the rebellion in the Bissao River, it appears that a Papel had come into the town of Bissao to buy spirits. After having done this it may be assumed that he became drunk and noisy. The police attempted to arrest him, but did not succeed, as his friends resisted, and from this small beginning the rebellion arose. The police, seeing themselves out-numbered, fired on the friends of the man, and thus made matters much worse. Eventually the Papels left the town, but remained in the immediate vicinity, where they were joined by the Grumetas (the labourers of the factories). The gates of the town were then closed, and a siege was commenced. The Portuguese endeavoured to raise it by sending 150 native soldiers, led by Portuguese officers, but they were repulsed, and returned to the town with some loss in dead and wounded. In consequence of this reverse, a contingent of 300 Mandingoes was ordered to Bissao to occupy it. These Mandingoes attempted an attack on the insurgents, sallying out of the town without their officers, but after a protracted fight, had to retire into the town with the loss of their guns and ammunition, as well as a large number of killed and wounded.""}, {'id': 6247, 'article_title': 'FRANCE AND DAHOMEY.', 'full_section_title': 'FRANCE AND DAHOMEY.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1892#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_09_1892', 'content': 'The events of the French expedition against Dahomey move slowly. At the end of July, Colonel Dodds, who is in supreme command of the French force, was slowly succeeding in driving King Behanzi to terms. With the first arrival of reinforcements Colonel Dodds began to enlarge the circle of the outposts, while not neglecting the old positions. He opened two new roads, one from Porto Novo to Sakete, on the Adjara river, near the British frontier at Lagos, the other binding Porto Novo to Dangbo, a place between the Oueme and the Adjara, near the spot where Captain Oudard was killed in 1890. These operations restored peace in the Decame country. King Behanzi meanwhile continued to affirm his right to Kotonou, and persisted in the assertion of his intention to annex a portion of the province of Porto Novo, placed under the French protectorate by King Toffa. He accepted, he said, the treaty of October, 3, 1890, and he set at liberty the merchants confined at Whydah. The next movement of Colonel Dodds was in defence of certain outlying friendly villages, and he drove back by slight stages a number of Dahomey warriors. This act and the news of the arrival of the auxiliaries determined the minds of some of the neighbouring chiefs, vassals of King Behanzi, who partially espoused the French cause.\n\nIt was not till after the close of the first week in August that hostilities actually began, all the preparations for the commencement of active operations being then complete.

According to a later despatch from Kotonou, the column which left that place returned on the following day after burning the villages of Kotonou, about two miles to the southwest of the French fort, and Zobo, about seven miles to the north-west. The column had a sharp encounter with the enemy, who were well-posted in ambush. The fight lasted until the evening, and the French loss was two sergeants killed and ten men slightly wounded.

Trade was brisk; merchants prosperous, or apparently so; no dark clouds threatened the political atmosphere, and so matters continued till the ever eventful and memorable year of \'63, when the Ashantee war burst with all its horrors on my native land. I was one of the many who took the field at that eventful period in defence of hearth, home, and kindred; and I was one of those who returned from the campaign disgusted at its empty show.\n\nI have watched the tide of events since then. The foolish expedition to the Prah; the rapid succession of governors; the peace hoax of one—the maladministration of another; the interchange of territories, and the complications raised by it; the consequent formation of a confederacy (the Fanti Confederation) among the kings and chiefs of the Western part of the Protectorate; the intrigues of one or two of our most influential men to attain the ascendancy within it; the want of unity and confidence amongst the principal members thereof, and many other incidental causes, have not escaped my observation. I shall therefore claim space in your invaluable paper for this letter, should you consider it worthy of insertion.\n\nThe great bane of this country is the want of unity and confidence among its principal men, the love of prejudice, the desire to rise on the ruin of others, envy, hatred, malice, and the like evils.

Show me the man who exposes the maladministration of affairs here, and he becomes ""a marked man,"" to be got rid of at all risks, to be hunted to the death. Of these we have instances; witness the Bannermans and Fiasson.

Here he assembled those who had been fighting with each other, and after several palavers induced them to make peace and to re-open the roads for traffic to the colony. He then, after a brief stay in Freetown, proceeded by sea to British Sherbro, and up the Kittam river to the disturbed districts. From Lavanah, one of the coast trading stations of the Sulymah and Sherbro Trading Company, he sent to the chiefs in the immediate neighbourhood of our new territories, inviting them to ""hold palaver"" with him at that place. They came, each attended, like the Highland chiefs of old, with a large retinue of followers, and were received by Sir Samuel in such state as the West Coast can show. Their principal spokesman was the chief Fah-Woondoo, and his first question, after the Governor had explained his object in calling them together, was rather singular. He said, \'Who sent for you to make peace?\' Had such a question been addressed to a mere Downing-street official it would have been taken as a perfect justification of the \'let alone\' policy; the interview would have ended then and there, and the report home would have been to the effect that the natives desired none of our interference. The present Governor, however, knew his man better. The natives of this part never reject, but always welcome, the intervention of the power of England, in which they have the utmost faith. Therefore, instead of resenting a seeming impertinence, he simply asked Fah-Woondoo to explain his question, whereupon the chief replied, \'Last year we sent to Governor Havelock asking him to assist us in making peace, and he refused to come, saying he would have nothing to do with our country palavers. But now that we are getting our enemies into a corner, you come and say you are a peacemaker, and wish us to stop the war. Therefore, we wish to know who sent for you.\' Such an opening of the \'palaver\' was most unpromising, but the Governor being able to talk to them in their own country fashion, he at last got the whole of the chiefs whom Fah-Woondoo represented to agree with him as to the desirability of stopping the war. He then proceeded to Sulymah, where he stayed some time, occupied in the endeavour to get the interior chiefs to come down and meet him there. In this, however, he was as unsuccessful as all his predecessors had been, for reasons which I pointed out in my last letter. Sir Samuel, however, went up the Sulymah river a considerable distance into the heart of the country, where the aggressive chiefs, who had depopulated the countries nearer the coast and who had refused to come to him to Sulymah, were living within their strongly fortified \'war fences.\' Being within their country, he was able to succeed in getting them all to a palaver with him on the subject of peace, and at last, by the exercise of his own personal influence, he induced them to accompany him back to Lavanah, taking them peacefully even through their enemies\' countries. Here he presided over a great palaver between the contending parties, which lasted two whole days, and closed on the 12th of May last with a solemn shaking of hands, according to country fashion, in presence of the Governor, and a declaration of peace. The principal chiefs who came down from the interior with Sir Samuel Rowe were Boccary Governor and Henry Tucker, who have long been the most powerful chiefs fighting the Zorokong party, and the chiefs present belonging to the countries near the coast were Fah-Woondoo, Zorokong Chief, Momodoo Kiki, Fourah Gograh, and many other minor chiefs.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1885#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.572, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Chiefs and Kings of the Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—The interest which your journal has always taken in the affairs of West Africa induces me to solicit a space for the insertion of this article, which I trust will not fail to lead to an amelioration of the state of things, by its being brought to the knowledge of those whom it concerns.\n\nOne of the results of the Ashanti Campaign was to bring the countries on the Gold Coast under the control or protection of the British Government. The countries on the sea-coast are divided into districts, to each of which a Commissioner is appointed by the Governor. The interior countries, however, are not thus provided for, but are left to be ruled by their chiefs and kings, as formerly. The authority of these kings and chiefs was not formally acknowledged, and any offence which, according to custom, is visited with severe punishment, is immediately reported to the Government authorities on the sea-coast; and the chieftain or king who ordered the punishment is brought before the Court and treated as the commonest fellow.\n\nThis action on the part of the Government terrifies and paralyzes a good many of these chiefs and kings, so that in a great many instances the wicked go unpunished. On the other hand, others use the name of the Government to acquire territories which they have not the least right to. Amongst these I may mention the name of one ""Sakiaty,"" who is of great notoriety in Eastern Croboe, interior of Accra. This man was a chief of Odumase, a country of Eastern Croboe, before the Ashanti Campaign, but immediately after the war, he assumed the authority and title of king, which he said was vested in him by Sir John Glover for the valuable services he rendered in the war. Not contented with the throne which he has thus usurped, he is now intriguing to acquire Western Croboe also. The present king of Western Croboe, who is now being molested, forbears to say anything, lest his opposition may end in a contest, and he may be thereby brought to the sea-coast and treated with ignominy. But there is sure to come a successor who will dispute every inch of ground that ""Sakiaty"" has thus acquired. This will undoubtedly end in strife, when people will have the mortification again to see that their royalties are treated contemptuously by those who are their protectors. If the present system of government in the interior countries is to continue, I would, Sir, respectfully recommend that the following plans be carried out: (1) that every chieftain or king in the interior should prove his claim; (2) that the right of government by native chiefs and kings in the interior, so far as it is compatible with common sense and humanity, be proclaimed as supported by the British authorities on the sea-coast; and (3), that any unnecessary interference and aggression of one chief or king with another, be met with the highest displeasure of the Governor.', 'last_edit_date': '1880-06-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_08_1880#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.569, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'State of the Eastern Districts of the Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Our district continues in the same disturbed and unsatisfactory state as the last mail left it.

Convinced of the hopelessness of expecting that peace could be maintained so long as the Fantees and other tribes remained subject to the exactions and oppressions of their former rulers, and yet foreseeing at the same time the dangers which must result if so large a body of natives, composed of different tribes, and having different interests and views, were left to carry on their affairs without the control or guidance of any superior power, believing moreover that the influence of such a superior and civilised power would help to work valuable reforms among the most turbulent and lawless of them, he conceived the idea of compelling from the King of Ashantee an acknowledgment of their independence, and by the influence over them which our interference on their behalf had obtained for us, of inducing them to band themselves together under our guidance and control for protection against the common enemy.

This line of policy has, at least to some extent, since been acted upon, with the results of stopping the native wars, the revival of trade, and the advancement of the interests of the colony generally. These results are largely due to Sir Samuel Rowe's tact and ability, and his knowledge, obtained by previous experience, of the peculiar wants of the district and native character; and also in no small measure to the non-observance of the instructions from the Colonial Office, which left former Governors without discretion to act as they from experience knew to be necessary.\n\nThe colony of Sierra Leone was established and maintained for the purpose of becoming an emporium of commerce and a means of civilizing the whole of that part of Africa through the extension of its communications with the interior. Unhappily, the colony is surrounded by a number of small tribes, continually at war with each other, thereby preventing traffic to the more peaceable inhabitants and the markets of the interior. The trade of Sierra Leone and its dependencies is essentially a transport trade. The amount of goods produced or consumed in the colony itself is quite insignificant, as nearly everything that enters or leaves it is intended for the interior. The question of peace or war among the neighbouring tribes is thus a most serious matter to the prosperity of the colony. And yet the late Governor, doubtless under instructions, refused to join an agent of the French Governor of Senegal in order to stop a war between the Susoos and Timmannees, on the ground that they were outside the Settlement.

It may be proper where British settlements are surrounded by powerful and fierce nations, like those of Ashantee and Dahomey, for our Government to forbid interference in their affairs lest we should be drawn into conflict with them. But the case is entirely different in the neighbourhood of Sierra Leone. There the people are divided into a large number of very small tribes, and, although their petty wars are sufficient to fill their country with bloodshed, and frequently to stop our trade, they have never shown either inclination or capacity to unite under one chief or to form anything like a nation. Their wars are all between themselves, and mutual friends and foes all alike are inclined to welcome our interference as arbitrators in their disputes. To deny to our local Governors the right to do so is not only cruel to these people, but downright destructive to the trade and prosperity of the colony.

In my last letter I also showed that the long-continued native wars, in which multitudes of people near my own part of the country had been killed, whole districts reduced to starvation, trade entirely stopped, and no revenue obtainable from the coast, we had recently annexed for the sake of revenue, might have been stopped by a little judicious action on the part of our Governor, which he was prevented from taking by orders from Downing-street.

The truth is they have no commanders. Their kings, chiefs, and captains are such in name only—not a soul cares for any one of them. Now just look at King Cudjoe of Accra.

This is not to be wondered at; what is surprising is that the Government does not assume the authority which these chiefs once did possess, but which is now exercised by nobody.

The Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast, whose principal time ought to be occupied in dealing with matters of Sierra Leone, with which he is directly connected (owing to the additional employment given him, to superintend the affairs of the minor settlements), can scarcely find time to attend to matters connected with his own immediate government with any degree of satisfaction; for when he should be at his seat regulating and adjusting the public machinery of Sierra Leone, he is away to some other place, settling some petty disputes between some petty chiefs—disputes with which he is as incapable of dealing as the Lord Mayor of London. What does the Governor-in-Chief, who resides at Sierra Leone, know of the manners, customs, and habits of the Fantees and Ashantees to qualify him for dealing with matters connected with those tribes? He governs over a people dissimilar in every respect, and is governed only by hearsay information, which is very often at variance with facts. The local administrators who dwell among these tribes, and who have thereby the opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with the laws and customs of these people under their immediate control, ought, if proper care be exercised by the Colonial office in its appointments, to be more competent to adjust matters between them than any governor-in-chief of Sierra Leone, who has come among them on a flying visit, and with no other knowledge than such as he calls on the way. You would perhaps laugh right out if you were told that the King of the Bulloms was authorised to regulate the government of Sierra Leone; but surely this is not more ridiculous than giving the Governor-in-Chief power to meddle in the matters of all the various tribes on the West Coast. The new system, then, is of no practical utility, but rather a great disadvantage to Sierra Leone. There was some hope in the beginning that it would be the means of great improvements, but it has been fairly tried and has failed, sadly failed; and what is left now is that it is necessary to do away with it, and confine every governor to the immediate government of his own colony, and not to allow him to interfere with the affairs of other settlements, which he cannot possibly understand or manage.

It is a fact well within the knowledge of all interested in the welfare of the oldest British colony in Africa that for some years past the French, by means of treaties made with the chiefs of the Upper Niger and Western Soudan, have been gradually encroaching upon the hitherto not very well-defined boundaries of the Colony of Sierra Leone, with the result of gradually reducing the British sphere of influence, and at the same time narrowing the field from which the merchants and traders of that Colony draw their native produce, and in which, in return, they have been in the habit of finding a market for their imported goods. Rather more than two years ago, an agreement was concluded at Paris between our Government and that of France with regard to the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence in West Africa. The territories referred to in the agreement were Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast. It was provided that the two Governments should have the right of appointing special Commissions of Delimitation ""to trace upon the spot, wherever they may consider it necessary, the line of demarcation between the English and French possessions"" in conformity with the agreement. The work of determining the boundary line between Senegambia and Sierra Leone is now about to be begun, the British Commissioners having left Liverpool on Saturday last. For some time past British merchants interested in commerce with Sierra Leone have been apprehensive that their trade with the interior might be seriously interfered with, if not absolutely ruined, by a wrongful definition of the boundary. Our trade with Sierra Leone is mainly dependent upon the caravan traffic between the British port of Freetown and the upper portion of the Niger.

The traders of this colony are demanding that measures shall be taken for their protection along the great trade route that passes through Bechuanaland to the north.

Undoubtedly we have here a great field for the expansion of English philanthropy and English commerce, but it remains to be seen how far the taxpayer is willing to contribute to secure this field. He is generous in his philanthropy, but shrewd in business transactions. The base of operations is the European settlements of the Cape Colony, the Free State, and the Transvaal Republic. And there are two main factors in the case. On the one hand there is the control, shared between the Imperial and the local Governments; on the other there is the local force, divided into the two elements, English and Dutch. These four powers are always at work. The Imperial Government endeavours to arrest a too rapid and extravagant progress, but the Colonial Government is always ahead of this wise caution, and this is chiefly due to the fact that the local Governments have no ultimate responsibility. Colonial energy is always outrunning colonial strength. The English element pushes on fearlessly, relying on English organization and administration to create order in its rear. The Dutch element proceeds on purely ""individualistic"" lines.

His first acts after his accession to office led ordinary minds to indulge in hopes favourable for the country; but this was only a ruse, which deceived many others as well as myself.

Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

Thereafter, up to about 1906, over 18000 New World Africans mostly aided by the ACS settled, annually, in Liberia in congeries of over thirty towns close to the Atlantic littoral on land obtained by the ACS or the Liberian government from the African chiefs of the region. Almost all of them were Afro-Americans, but at least 400 were Afro-West Indians from Barbados who emigrated in 1865 and settled together at Crozierville, 13 km inland from Monrovia. Over 5000 Recaptives - mostly from the Congo region - were also settled, particularly between 1844 and 1863, initially in the care of the Americo-Liberians as the New World African settlers and their descendants were collectively designated. 4\nNeeding land for farming, trade, and for building a great nation, and faced with some competition from the British and the French seeking land to build trading factories and military stations, the Americo-Liberians greatly expanded Liberia's territory from the few isolated points on the coast initially leased to them by African chiefs. By December 1875, when the expansion virtually ceased, Liberia allegedly stretched for 960 km along the Atlantic coast and between 320 and 400 km inland and hypothetically as far as the River Niger (see Fig. n.1). It embraced the Americo-Liberian and Recaptive settlements and peoples and the indigenous African ethnic groups and their territories.

Throughout the nineteenth century, Americo-Liberians' policy was to assimilate the indigenous Africans culturally and politically by 'civilizing' and Christianizing them, and giving them equal rights with the settlers. Although this was achieved to some extent with the Recaptives (who were much less numerous than the settlers), the Americo-Liberians, mindful of their own privileged position, main› tained tight political control over Liberia by restricting political participa› tion of even those indigenous Africans who were educated. Only very few of them were given the franchise on an equal footing with the AmericoLiberians (although these might themselves be illiterate and poor). The main indigenous African representation (mostly of the coastal Africans) in the Liberian Legislature as from 1875 consisted of African chiefs designated 'referees' (or 'delegates'), after their chiefdoms had paid an annual 'delegate fee' of $100 to the Liberian government. As the delegates 'spoke' through an interpreter solely on ethnic matters and could not vote, they had very little influence on government policy.$^{8}$ Hence both the educated Africans and the chiefs resented their restricted representation. Furthermore the Liberian government sought to maximize its import and export duties and other levies on trade and shipping which constituted its main sources of revenue. To facilitate collection and control of the external trade by Americo-Liberian merchants, from 1839 the government restricted foreign merchants to trade at only six Americo-Liberian portsof-entry. The restrictions and levies alienated both the foreign merchants who resented them, and the indigenous African chiefs who had formerly controlled the external trade and levied the dues. Often, the foreign merchants and chiefs combined to resist or defy the trade restrictions and levies, or to appeal to European states to intervene on their behalf. Thus, at various times during the nineteenth century, the Vai, Kru and Grebo of the Liberian coast put up an armed resistance to Liberian government impositions on their trade. 9"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.746, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia on the eve of the Scramble for Africa Liberia > Liberia', 'content': ""The Americo-Liberians practised an essentially western culture in their life style, political institutions, through the use of the English language, individual ownership and perpetual alienation of land, and their adherence to Christianity and monogamy.

Up to 1914 most of the commissioners were Americo-Liberian or educated indigenous Liberian military officers. The administration was largely oppressive and corrupt. Most of the district commissioners, their aides, and troops, being poorly and irregularly paid, and seldom supervised from Monrovia, lived off their districts by extorting food, labour for their private farms, and excessive fines and taxes (above the official one dollar poll-tax on adult males, and labour required for public buildings and roads). 65 Not surprisingly, the indigenous Africans resisted not only their military subjugation to Liberian government authority - just as Africans elsewhere resisted subjugation to European rule - but also the excesses of the Liberian administration.

This situation changed somewhat in the 1920s when the People's Party, organized in 1922 under the leadership of ex-President Daniel B. Howard, seriously challenged the ruling True Whig Party.

This lack of continuity was manifested in the variety of names which such parties bore: the Union Party, during the elections of May 1897 and 1899; the People's Party, in May 1901; the National Union True Whig Party, in May 1911; the People's Party in May 1921, 1927, and 1931; and the United True Whig Party, in May 1935.

Whereas most of the True Whig candidates won with large majorities, only a few of the opposition candidates won. 23 Thus, excepting the 1920s and early 1930s when the People's Party seriously challenged the True Whig Party, Liberia had gradually evolved during the twentieth century into a virtual one-party state - one of the earliest African countries to do so."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.717, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia: socio-cultural developments, 1915-35', 'content': ""During this period, Liberia and Ethiopia encountered grave problems of national integration and survival resulting partly from vast expansion during the previous century and the increased disparateness of their peoples and cultures. What major cultural and social changes occurred in both countries during this period?\nOf Liberia's population, the Americo-Liberians as a group remained politically and economically dominant. Since the late nineteenth century their number had reportedly declined owing to a higher death than birth rate, and the virtual cessation of immigration of blacks from America. The situation led to increased intermarriage and liaison, mostly between Americo-Liberian men and indigenous African women (many of whom were educated in the Liberian schools), and a corresponding increase of Liberians with mixed Americo-Liberian/indigenous African parentage. In› variably, such Liberians and indigenous African youths apprenticed to or adopted by Americo-Liberian families became assimilated to the AmericoLiberian socio-cultural milieu. 4\nThe decline in the Americo-Liberian population probably also intensified their practice of in-group marriages, and correspondingly the extended family system that had developed among them since the late nineteenth century. Thus throughout our period, established families like the Shermans; the Barclays, Colemans, Coopers, Dennises, Grimeses and Morrises; the Greens, Grigsbys, Rosses, Witherspoons and Worrells; the Brewers, Dossens, Gibsons and Tubmans, mentioned in Chapter 11 of this volume, continued to provide most of Liberia's political and economic leadership.$^{5}$ Indeed by the 1920s it became the practice for these families to allocate, through some mutual agreement, legislative seats, ministerial posts, and other high public positions and patronage many months before formal elections to the legislature took place. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.745, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia: socio-cultural developments, 1915-35', 'content': ""As for the indigenous Liberians, the gradual expansion of schools and Christian missionary work throughout Liberia somewhat increased their literacy, modernization, and assimilation of some aspects of the AmericoLiberian culture. Indigenous Liberians thus assimilated were regarded as 'civilized' (or 'semi-civilized') by the Americo-Liberians who granted a comparatively few of them political and civil rights on an equal footing with themselves. A few of those thus favoured rose to prominent public or political positions, like Dr Benjamin W. Payne, a Bassa man trained in medicine in the United States, who held a Cabinet position as Secretary of Public Instruction for most of the 1910s and 1920s; Henry Too Wesley, a Grebo man, who was Liberia's Vice-President in the early 1920s; Didwo Twe, a Kru Senator (Plate 28.1); and Momolu Massaquoi, a Vai man, who was at various times in the 1920s Acting Secretary of the Interior and Liberia's Consul in Germany. 7\nNevertheless, even the favoured educated Africans - let alone the mass of unenfranchised and largely oppressed indigenous Liberians - were more or less dissatisfied with 'Americo-Liberian rule' - as they rightly termed the Liberian government. As a rule the educated indigenous Liberians sought to reform Liberia's socio-political system to secure a better deal for the indigenous Liberians. Only rarely, as in 1930, during the forced labour crisis in Liberia, did some of the leading educated indigenous Liberians actively seek to overthrow the Americo-Liberians and supplant them in the government. 8\nAcculturation was, however, not unidirectional. Over the years the Americo-Liberians had themselves adapted many aspects of indigenous Liberian culture which they had earlier abhorred or decried as super› stitious or heathenish, such as belief in the efficacy of magic, witchcraft and 'native medicine'; initiation into the poro; and the practice of pawning persons to meet a debt or other obligation.$^{9}$ The degree of such African› ization was, however, too limited to blur the main social, economic, political and cultural distinctions between the Americo-Liberians as a group, and the indigenous Liberians, by the terminal date of this study in 1935."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.767, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Foreign intervention in Liberia and Ethiopia, 1915-35 > Liberia', 'content': 'First, the Liberian government\'s penury and perennial indebtedness partly led to increased foreign control of Liberia\'s financial administration by the International Receivership, the Bank of British West Africa, and Firestone interests supported by the United States government.

Secondly, Liberia\'s unfavourable economic, social and administrative conditions became a major issue in the bitter political rivalry between the True Whig and People\'s parties and attracted considerable international attention.

More importantly, the reports in both the American and British press and other reports by foreign missionaries and visitors accused the Liberian government and certain influential Americo-Liberians of practising slavery, recruiting forced and indentured labour, and exporting or selling migrant labour to European colonies especially to the Spanish island-colony of Fernando Po. 80 Britain spearheaded the foreign attack, condemning the exports and demanding, as in 1907-9, that to ameliorate the unfavourable conditions in Liberia, her government should be placed under European control. 81 The United States similarly berated Liberia about \'the so-called ""export"" of labour from Liberia to Fernando Po ... which seems hardly distinguish› able from organized slave trade\'.

Secondly, during the period 1915-35, perhaps even more than before, gross corruption and malpractices were resorted to in Liberia's public system and political processes. The keen competition between the True Whig and People's parties in the 1920s and early 1930s particularly exacerbated election malpractices, mostly by the ruling True Whig Party.

Faulkner, 9000 votes, whereas there were not more than 10 000 individuals entitled to vote throughout Liberia in that year. 25 Thirdly, as in the nineteenth century, the ruling and opposition parties were divided mainly by clashes of personalities or disagreements over the sharing of the social surplus and not by any marked ideological or policy differences. In 1911, for instance, the People's Party was organized by a splinter group of the True Whig Party as a consequence of Liberia's Vice-President Jerome J. Dossen of Maryland losing his bid for nomination as True Whig presidential candidate to Daniel B. Howard, the National Chairman of the party. Similarly in 1927, many True Whigs joined the People's Party not primarily because they favoured that party's pro› grammes, but because they opposed President King's bid for a 'third term'.$^{26}$ In the absence of major ideological or policy differences among Liberians, politics became largely a matter of collaboration or competition between the leading, mostly Americo-Liberian, families in the ruling or opposition parties to control the social surplus."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.721, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Foreign intervention in Liberia and Ethiopia, 1915-35 > Liberia', 'content': ""The Liberian government then drew up a 'Three Year Development Plan' of internal reforms in Liberia, including modifications to the Loan Agreement of 1926 already demanded by the Liberian government.

By selling German property con› fiscated during the First World War, the Liberian government realized about $I54000.$^{4S}$ Moreover, the fiscal measures introduced in December 1922, particularly the new tariff, were beginning to pay off.$^{46}$ As Liberia's foreign trade began to revive, especially after the Germans re-entered it in 1922, and the Liberian hinterland was reopened to foreign traders, exports rose, and the balance of trade began to shift in Liberia's favour. During the first nine months of 1923, for example, the value of exports exceeded that of the corresponding period for 1922 by $i690oo. 47 Just as Liberian government finances thus began to recover, even brighter prospects for the Liberian economy became foreseeable when in 1926 the American, Harvey S. Firestone obtained from the Liberian government the right to lease for ninety-nine years up to one million acres in Liberia to grow and export rubber, and Liberia secured a loan of $5000000 from the Finance Corporation of America to develop infrastructure including roads, hospitals and schools, as well as to pay her debts.$^{48}$ The loan, which received United States government support, greatly increased the influence of Firestone and the United States in Liberia."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.722, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia: socio-cultural developments, 1915-35', 'content': ""the hardship and lash of slavery in the New World: Brought here the civilization, education and religion that were to be imparted to the natives and with these it was hoped that the two elements would build a great solidified and united nation ...

The first independent civilized African State on the West Coast, she occupies a position of great honour and usefulness. With institutions framed on the model of those of the United States of America, she stands out boldly before the world asserting and proving that there is no lack of natural ability in the civilized African to work the machinery of free institutions. Her President, her judges, her learned professors, are Christian Africans; no white man holds any political position in the country; the nation is essentially negro, and is so far from feeling any need of European or American aid in carrying on the various departments of her government, that she does more than discourage, she prohibits the permanent settlement of white men within her borders. They may come there for purposes of trade, but they are not permitted to acquire landed property; African she is, and exclusively African she is determined to remain. The enemies and libellers of the African race not unfrequently point to Liberia with contempt and ridicule, because she has not obtained in infancy the development of manhood; because, having no capital but what has been created by the industry of her own people, she is not able to undertake those works of civilization which are so much needed for the rapid development of her great natural resources; because, amid the abundant elements of wealth existing in her rich tropical fertility, and with her capability of producing so many objects that Europe requires and is compelled to seek even at the opposite side of the world, her Government is poor, and her revenue insufficient, without constant patriotic self-denial on the part of her principal citizens, for the support of those establishments indispensable to a free Christian State, which includes within her borders a native heathen population more than twenty times exceeding in number the civilized population of which the State really consists. But so far from there being anything in her public condition to justify contempt and ridicule such as our ignorantly-learned anthropologists would heap upon her and her people, every impartial man will find cause in her for wonder and felicitation that a mere handful of people brought to the African Coast from the degrading servitude of the late Slave States of the great American Republic should have fallen into so few errors, and have made such rapid progress. For it must be especially borne in mind that no comparison between Liberia and an English colony would be fair. An English colony, however small the number of emigrants and their descendants may be, is constantly and from its very birth receiving assistance from realized British capital. But the African emigrants from the United States to Liberia have not had any such resources at their back. They or their fathers have been slaves; and their only means of reaching Liberia was by the gift of a free passage, with six months free support after arrival, by the Colonization Society which founded this refuge for emancipated slaves on the West Coast of Africa. There have been no African Crusoes to help to build up this African Republic; the wealth, whatever it may be, within her is only the surplus of what her own people have created, over and above what they required for their own support. The progress thus made must necessarily be slow in comparison with that of an English colony anywhere, although it may be, as it has been in reality, rapid when viewed only in connexion with the elements available for promoting it. But we hope and believe that the time is now approaching when that progress will be greatly stimulated. Liberia, formed of American Africans, strongly imbued with the Republican principles so extreme in the American people, is not likely to attract any new elements of wealth and population from any other country than that from which its present civilized population has been derived. Ardently desiring as we do to see a rapid advance in Liberia, we rejoiced when we foresaw, as an inevitable consequence of the civil war in the United States, an increased emigration of emancipated Africans from those states to Liberia. The extreme change in the position of the late slaves in America, who have been so suddenly elevated from a debasing bondage, from a condition in which they were estimated rather as beasts than as men, to the full privileges of citizenship, political as well as social, has, however, retarded that movement toward Africa which would otherwise have impelled large numbers of the emancipated to Liberia. Still, the desire to become citizens of an exclusively African Republic, and that in Africa, has been gradually spreading in America, and the Colonization Society, who sent a shipload of emigrants in November last, and another in May, will despatch their ship again in November next with a further addition of some 800 for the African Republic. From the published statements of the society we have reason to believe that 4,000 or 5,000 emigrants might have been sent to Liberia during the present year, instead of some 1,500, had the society been in possession of the requisite funds. We must express our hope that the Colonization Society will be able to obtain all the money it may require to realize the spontaneous desires of late American slaves to become Liberian citizens. It is only by a large increase in her civilized industrial population that Liberia can make rapid progress in production and wealth. She is limited to this source of increase by the elements of which she is composed, by the nature of her institutions, and the strong peculiarities of her people; and all who are desirous of seeing the West Coast countries and their peoples emerge from their barbarism and degradation and come within the sphere of Christian civilizing influences should assist the Colonization Society of the United States in conveying emigrants to Liberia. We had hoped that before 1870 her civilized population would there be increased to at least 50,000. She could with the assistance rendered by the society for six months after the arrival of the emigrants in Liberia have very well established the requisite number, or even a greater number, within her borders before that period could they have been sent to her; and such an addition to her civilized labourers on her coasts and the rich lands of her navigable rivers would, we are convinced, soon give to the carping libellers of the African race new and forcible evidence of the just claim of the African to the rights and sympathies of a common brotherhood with the hitherto more favoured European.'}, {'id': 1873, 'article_title': 'THE WOMEN IN LOG AT CAVALLA RIVER', 'full_section_title': 'THE WOMEN IN LOG AT CAVALLA RIVER', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1870#article-13', 'issue_date': '23_08_1870', 'content': '\n\nthat the President of the Republic of Liberia and Mr. Johnson, the secretary, both now in London, had never heard of any such distressing events, and entirely disbelieved their correctness. The information on which we have proceeded came however from such sources, that the ignorance of the President and Mr. Secretary Johnson relative to such circumstances could not shake our faith in the correctness of the alleged facts we had published, and only served to increase the pain such occurrences within the Liberian territory had produced; because if, as we are bound to believe, the President and Mr. Secretary Johnson had never heard of them, there seemed to be no hope of any measures of relief having been adopted by the Government of which they are the most prominent members. We, however, refrained from any further allusion to the sad events, in the hope that the poor creatures would have been relieved by some local action consequent upon the exposure we had already made. A letter we now publish proves, however, that we were not justified in such hopes, and that the American Africans of Cape Palmas are only courageous against their own Government and unoffending officials that it may have appointed. Shame on them! We cannot admit the validity of the extenuating arguments of the new Liberian journal, the *Liberia Register*, though we are delighted to see that so ably conducted a newspaper has been established, and wish it a great success. What we have complained of and especially commented upon is the inaction of the Liberian authorities, both general and local, in the matter. Of course if the President and Mr. Secretary Johnson had never heard of the disgraceful occurrence they could not have done anything for the poor helpless victims; but while fully believing this, because of the assurances we had received from consular agents for whom personally we have a very strong regard, we could not conceive how it was they had not heard of them, seeing that our informants, on whom we know we can rely, alluded to preliminary inquiries made by the Liberian Government in the matter. But the *Liberia Register* in its second number shows us how such a thing may be supposed to have happened. The editor exposes a culpable silence on the part of the preceding Liberian Administration in the matter of the demands made by the Government of Sierra Leone, viz.—that of the facts and demands having been definitely laid down by the Foreign-office in London; so that a most erroneous impression with regard to the attitude of the Foreign-office in London had been allowed to prevail in Liberia. *The correspondence was not on record, or regularly filed in the State Department, like other papers.* Are we not justified in assuming that the Cavalla River atrocities, and the cry of the Cape Palmas Town people for help, were treated in the same fashion as the despatch of Earl Clarendon setting forth the demands of Great Britain for reparation to British subjects alleged to have suffered wrong and loss from the Liberians? The sooner such a system is put an end to the better. The first duty of a government is to look its difficulties boldly in the face and to exert itself to remove them. We hope that of Liberia will so act, if they have not already done so, in this matter of the poor imprisoned and outraged women of Cape Palmas Town. The Government of Liberia cannot plead ignorance of it, since the contents of our May number were brought under their notice, and we shall no doubt soon have to record the pleasing intelligence that by some vigorous intervention on its part an effective relief has been given. We repeat that it is our very anxious desire to see the Republic of Liberia take a high stand among civilised states; but it can only do this by a very different course on the part of its Government to that which it has pursued in the matter of the British claims (as exposed by the editor of the *Liberia Register*) and the Cavalla River atrocities.'}, {'id': 2051, 'article_title': 'The Crisis in Liberia', 'full_section_title': 'The Crisis in Liberia', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1871#article-3', 'issue_date': '23_08_1871', 'content': 'OUR CRISIS.\n\nThat there is nothing in finance, nothing in any of the departments of industrial development which can be safely inaugurated in Liberia—or any other country—with any hope of successful duration until the good government of the country can be reckoned upon is a truth that ought to sink deep into the minds of our people.

Here there is a certain amount of good trade, and there might be much more, but unfortunately, though amongst the citizens of the Republic, notably in Mr. Blyden, we find some men whose intellect and culture would fit them for any society in the world, the greater portion of the settlers from America and their descendants have not fulfilled the high hopes of those who took part in the foundation of this negro State, where, untrammelled by any fancied superiority of the whites, and saved from the contamination of vice, the negro was to prove his capability for progress and self-government.\n\nAt the same time, Liberia is far from deserving all the abuse that is lavished on it, for nowhere else on the coast of Africa do we find such evidences of civilization among negroes as here, and the faults they possess are those which are common to all civilized negroes. Their self-government has been sneered at, but it is wonderful that people without any experience should have done as well as they have. Commercial morality is not at a high standard, and more might be done in cultivation and improvement of the fertile country which is under the Liberian flag; and the Liberians would be wise if they did not insist upon negro blood being present in the veins of all their citizens. But many of the faults we see are faults of ignorance, and others arise from the bad example of whites. The coffee plantations of Liberia might be increased almost to an infinite extent, and through Liberia there should be opened up a route to the interior which would bring a large trade to the coast. Between Liberia and the French possession at Grand Bassam, on the frontier of the Gold Coast Colony, lies a long strip of coast inhabited principally by Kroomen, who trade with Bristol ships, but who will tell nothing of the interior; and hitherto the trade has been carried on by sailing ships from Bristol, which cruise up and down the coast. Till quite lately, only one or two white men have lived on shore, the places where the captains and supercargoes of the British ships landed being few and far between; but now the German flag has been hoisted over some small trading stations, and probably soon we shall find that these form pretexts for annexation to the German empire. Now that the Krooboys are so largely employed in the Oil Rivers, in the Gold Coast Colony, on board the mail steamers and in men-of-war, there should not be any difficulty in sending explorers to examine the terra incognita behind their homes, and from such examination we should reap immediate commercial advantage.'}, {'id': 5579, 'article_title': 'THE FUTURE OF AFRICA.', 'full_section_title': 'THE FUTURE OF AFRICA.', 'last_edit_date': '09-01-1887', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1887#article-6', 'issue_date': '01_09_1887', 'content': ""\n\nThis argument is, of course, based upon the results of negro self-government in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Liberia has been a black republic for forty years; Sierra Leone has been a negro colony for a century; and it cannot be denied that each of these communities has made very gratifying progress. Yet, upon Dr. Blyden's own showing, that progress has been but partial, he still has to complain of his countrymen's imitativeness and lack of backbone. The responsibility for this, undoubtedly, rests to some extent upon the unsuitable character of the education which the civilized negroes have received; but it is more to the purpose to remember that three generations is a very brief period in the development of a pagan people. How slow the work of civilization in Liberia has been may be seen from the fact that, whereas there are some twenty thousand Christian negroes in the republic, there are more than a million who are pagans. And now we inevitably come to the primary question of all: whether or not the presumed racial inferiority of the negro is proved. Dr. Blyden pleads eloquently for his fellows, and triumphantly asks: How could an inferior race have produced Toussaint L'Ouverture? The question is not unnatural, but it is far from logical. The matter, as it fashions itself to us, is, and is likely to remain for a long time to come, an open one. The negro has, as yet, enjoyed no sufficient opportunity of proving either his mental equality with or his inferiority to the white. The experience of Sierra Leone and Liberia, so far as it has gone, has been in his favour; what we know of his moral history in that other black republic, Hayti, and in the United States, is at the best negative. As time goes on, the question, which is far more momentous than would appear to the unthinking, will settle itself. Emigration from America to Liberia, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, is proceeding satisfactorily; and Dr. Blyden states that 200,000 negroes in the United States are prepared to return to the land of their fathers. But colonization by private effort is, at the best, exceedingly slow; and in this instance it is perhaps well that it is so, since the gradual settlement of Liberia is far more likely to provide material for a strong and healthy State than a hasty rush would be. Social reformers for many a year to come will watch the experiment, as they have watched it in the past, with keen interest. The chief danger lies, as Dr. Blyden constantly points out, in the tendency to Europeanize the negro—to supersede customs and practices which are useful and often necessary in Africa by customs utterly out of place there. The ill-directed zeal of some of the less reflective missionaries has, no doubt, been to blame for some of this; but there is, we fancy, very little to complain of upon this head now. Let it be once proved beyond all doubt that negroes can found flourishing colonies, can develop the limitless resources of the continent which has been the cradle of their race; and, above all, that they can govern themselves prudently and self-reliantly,—and there will open up before the black man the assurance of a future as splendid and far-reaching as any that ever presented itself to a white conqueror.""}, {'id': 6161, 'article_title': 'THE FRENCH IN WEST AFRICA', 'full_section_title': 'THE FRENCH IN WEST AFRICA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_11_1891#article-5', 'issue_date': '02_11_1891', 'content': 'Does one Englishman in ten thousand know that the French port of Dakar, by Cape Verd, is regularly visited by steamers belonging to eight different lines?

But one requires to look at a map like that annexed to Colonel Galliéni\'s work to realise what a pitiful strip our Colony of the Gambia, for instance, has become, nipped in between French possessions as between two half-open jaws ready to close upon it at any time. Not that, as far as England is concerned, she has any right to complain. She has had her opportunity, and neglected it. All that France has done, she might have done long ago, and far more easily. If West Africa, which should have been English, is to be French, it is only her own supineness which England has to thank. Colonel Galliéni, in one instance, admits that he had a difficulty in obtaining a treaty from the Sovereign of Dinguiray, which has been of old in relation with Sierra Leone, and where he expresses a hope that the religious question will raise no difficulties, evidently implying the influence of Protestant missionaries, whom the Roman Catholic Church, under French support, will at once try to root out. Yet England has certainly no right to quarrel now about a tract of country which is amongst the most insalubrious in the world, though it includes, between the 10th and 12th parallels of latitude, a plateau (termed by the French ""Fouta Djalon""), beginning about a hundred miles only from the coast, which appears destined to be a centre of European habitation and influence. The one thing to be really regretted, is the closing-in of the Liberian Republic. If there is one State in Africa which ought to have been allowed free elbow-room and Hinterland unlimited, it is the Negro Republic. Without in any wise setting it up as a realised ideal, it will be found that its development, unaided except at the first from any foreign source, has been more rapid than that of any European Colony in Western Africa, until France took up the idea of founding a West African empire, and poured men and money into her West African Colonies. Considering that Liberia was founded from the United States, and that even now the dream of recolonising Africa from the Western Continent has not died out, it appears astonishing that the United States Government should not have stepped forward to secure the free working of the one serious attempt towards civilising Africa through the African.'}, {'id': 6218, 'article_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'full_section_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'last_edit_date': '06-01-1892', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1892#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_06_1892', 'content': 'This negro Republic was founded by the efforts of the American Colonisation Society, who in 1820 purchased a tract of land in the neighbourhood of Cape Montserrado for the purpose of affording an opportunity of settlement to liberated slaves. The liberated slave represented the best elements of the negro population of his day. At the same time, in America, there was no place for him. He could not enjoy the privileges of a white man, he had lost the legal protection of his master; he was in fact neither slave nor free. It was to meet his wants that the Liberian enterprise was organised. None but liberated slaves were, at first, permitted to take part in it. Many of them were well educated and possessed advantages which might have made life in America more attractive than the hardships and dangers of a colonising experiment. White men were in the first instance excluded from citizenship in the new colony, and for many years Liberia was simply what it professed to be—a community of negroes, who sought in Africa the enjoyment of a freedom that could be only nominal in America.\n\nNotwithstanding the care taken the first band of settlers had to fight for their existence and owed the victory which established them upon the coast to the aid of an English man-of-war. Thus England saved the life of the young colony, and in the sequel the bond then established between them has never been forgotten on either side. In 1824 the town which the settlers had raised received the name of Monrovia bestowed upon it in honour of the then President of the United States. At the same time the social condition of the colonists gave the name of Liberia to their settlement. The colony flourished, agriculture was developed; a policy of trade with the natives and road and bridge making was inaugurated with much success, and in 1828 a charter of government which contained the germ of a more elaborate constitution was issued by the Colonisation Society. From the beginning the principle of self-government was recognised in a liberal manner. The agent and vice-agent alone were nominated by the Society, all subordinate officers were elected by the Colony, but the vote was restricted to landowners. The ""Maryland Colonisation Society"" had established another community on the same coast, in which the sale of intoxicating liquors was entirely forbidden. To these in 1833 and 1835 was added a Quaker colony from Pennsylvania, under whose auspices a detachment of artisans came to form part of the population of the State. The new arrivals settled in Grand Bassa, and in 1839 Liberia was divided into two counties, Montserrado, containing the capital, and Grand Bassa.

Five hundred, perhaps, at the most. It lies far away from the routes pursued by tourists, and the busy world hears little and knows less of the independent negro State which nestles in a corner of the West African Coast and has been the scene of a series of experiments absolutely unique in history. It was from this part of the African coast that some attempt was to be made to develop the Dark Continent. Emancipated slaves from the United States, now citizens of a republic established by themselves in the land of their forefathers, were to be the torchbearers of civilisation and to carry the lamp of learning to their brethren in the interior. Such was the scheme of the large-hearted and liberal philanthropists who, early in the present century, founded the various colonisation societies in the United States with a view of enabling its negro population to found settlements on the West Coast of Africa. These settlements were gradually formed, and, after passing through a series of trials, eventually confederated. In 1822 the republic was declared, and in 1847 Liberia was recognised as an independent State by the sovereigns of Europe and the United States Government. From Washington the new State borrowed its constitution. Although she has enjoyed the advantage of having had at least three Presidents—E. Johnson, Russworm, and Roberts—of high character and executive ability, it would be untrue to say that the hopes of the founders of Liberia have been realised. On the contrary the Liberian Government seems to have entirely failed to win the confidence or even to gain the respect of the native kings and tribes within its supposed ""sphere of influence""; indeed, some of them resist all attempts to enforce authority within the ill-defined boundaries of the State. At the recent inauguration of the new President—the Hon. — Cheeseman—it was a matter of general satisfaction that a gunboat, ordered from a Keil dockyard, was on her way out from Germany. This boat is to be the foundation of the new Liberian Navy, and, strange to say, it is required, not for the defence of the State, but to coerce a British merchant who for three years has declined to pay customs duty on the ground that he receives no protection from Government, that there is no civilised administration in the district in which he resides, and that he is compelled to employ and pay a police force of his own. The Government, urged by German merchants to suppress their independent competitor, has signified its intention of resorting to force, and will probably find itself in a difficulty with our Foreign Office if a single shot is fired on an English factory whose owner is considered to have made out a good case for non-payment of duty. The attempts of Christian missionaries to evangelise the Western districts of Africa have been discouraging. From the year 1481, when some priests from Rome unsuccessfully endeavoured to withstand the climate, the history of Christian labour is one continuous narrative of a futile struggle against disease and death. Protestant societies in the United States have literally poured dollars by thousands into Liberia. Some good work is being done by white ministers who have formed thriving settlements up the country (where the land is fertile and the climate healthy), and have urged upon the natives the importance of cultivating rice, corn, potatoes, ginger, sugar, coffee, and arrowroot, all of which are remunerative crops. As for cotton, indigo, pepper, pineapples, and gumtrees, they grow wild, and the superior knowledge of the missionaries has enabled the natives to gather them profitably. But Christian workers have to reckon with a foe more stubborn than Paganism. Islam is gradually winning its way towards the West Coast from the interior. The sword, it is true, goes hand in hand with the green banner, but the African negro is a ready convert. He finds the precepts of the Prophet easy to understand, and the sanction of polygamy is in entire accord with his present practice. Moreover, where Mahomet gains ground, intemperance—which unhappily follows Christian missions—disappears. I have said that Liberia is fertile. It is certainly the richest district in West Africa, but it is terribly neglected, and can never thrive under its present administration. There is practically no Government. The rule of the negro is marked by selfishness and corruption. The colonisation societies in the United States have almost abandoned in despair sending out more emigrants who, on landing, finding themselves free from control, quickly become lazy and wholly useless as pioneers for opening up fresh country. It must be confessed, therefore, that, after a trial of seventy years, the American negroes have failed to erect a State worthy of the name. They have lost what little credit they had twenty years ago—not even the interest is paid on the loan of 500,000 dols. raised in London in 1870—and Liberia is gradually drifting into the hands of a few wide-awake German merchants, who are understood to have made advances to Government against valuable securities, as well as to have exerted sufficient influence in Berlin to induce General Caprivi to protest in vigorous language against the concession known as the ""indiarubber monopoly,"" granted by President Johnson to an English syndicate of company promoters under circumstances which have been severely criticised. Lord Salisbury was aware of the facts, but it yet remains to be seen whether the British Government will raise its voice against a German protectorate of Liberia.—""E.

The civilised population at this time numbered about 5,000, but Liberia's position as a State in Africa resembled that of its founders as individuals in America. It had no legal existence among the nations. This fact was made apparent by the refusal of foreign ships to pay the duties imposed by its Legislature. The natives of the coast continued to harass it in consequence of its opposition to the slave trade, until the new State found itself between an upper and a nether millstone. Governor Roberts applied himself to overcome each difficulty in turn. He succeeded in persuading the native chiefs to appreciate the advantages of civilisation, and a number were induced to federate for the purpose of abolishing slavery and introducing orderly administration within their borders. The federated body shortly afterwards entered the colony, and in 1845 the territory of the Kroomen was annexed by friendly treaty, thus adding a third county, under the name of Sinou, to the two which already existed. The colony now extended to Grand Sesters. Maryland also widened the area of her administration, and the entire coast was occupied from Cape Mount to San Pedro. The two colonies resolved to make a joint effort at self-assertion. They imposed an ad valorem customs duty of 6 per cent. upon foreign imports, but English merchants refused to admit the right of the Liberians to impose duties, and insisted upon trading freely as with a savage territory. An English ship was seized and detained by the Liberian authorities. It was rescued by force, and the English Government refused to recognise the Liberian Executive. Liberia had no position except as a dependency of the United States, and the prejudice against colour in America caused that Government to give only lukewarm support to the African colony. If it were to exist at all, it was necessary that it should assert its individuality and claim for itself the rights which were denied to it. Under these circumstances the American Colonisation Society came to the resolution to abandon all rights over its protégé and advised it to take its fate boldly into its own hands. A Republican constitution was drawn up, and on August 24, 1847, the existence of the Republic of Liberia was announced to the world."", 'last_edit_date': '1892-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1892#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.731, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE FUTURE OF AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""This argument is, of course, based upon the results of negro self-government in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Liberia has been a black republic for forty years; Sierra Leone has been a negro colony for a century; and it cannot be denied that each of these communities has made very gratifying progress. Yet, upon Dr. Blyden's own showing, that progress has been but partial, he still has to complain of his countrymen's imitativeness and lack of backbone. The responsibility for this, undoubtedly, rests to some extent upon the unsuitable character of the education which the civilized negroes have received; but it is more to the purpose to remember that three generations is a very brief period in the development of a pagan people. How slow the work of civilization in Liberia has been may be seen from the fact that, whereas there are some twenty thousand Christian negroes in the republic, there are more than a million who are pagans. And now we inevitably come to the primary question of all: whether or not the presumed racial inferiority of the negro is proved. Dr. Blyden pleads eloquently for his fellows, and triumphantly asks: How could an inferior race have produced Toussaint L'Ouverture? The question is not unnatural, but it is far from logical. The matter, as it fashions itself to us, is, and is likely to remain for a long time to come, an open one. The negro has, as yet, enjoyed no sufficient opportunity of proving either his mental equality with or his inferiority to the white. The experience of Sierra Leone and Liberia, so far as it has gone, has been in his favour; what we know of his moral history in that other black republic, Hayti, and in the United States, is at the best negative. As time goes on, the question, which is far more momentous than would appear to the unthinking, will settle itself. Emigration from America to Liberia, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, is proceeding satisfactorily; and Dr. Blyden states that 200,000 negroes in the United States are prepared to return to the land of their fathers. But colonization by private effort is, at the best, exceedingly slow; and in this instance it is perhaps well that it is so, since the gradual settlement of Liberia is far more likely to provide material for a strong and healthy State than a hasty rush would be. Social reformers for many a year to come will watch the experiment, as they have watched it in the past, with keen interest. The chief danger lies, as Dr. Blyden constantly points out, in the tendency to Europeanize the negro—to supersede customs and practices which are useful and often necessary in Africa by customs utterly out of place there. The ill-directed zeal of some of the less reflective missionaries has, no doubt, been to blame for some of this; but there is, we fancy, very little to complain of upon this head now. Let it be once proved beyond all doubt that negroes can found flourishing colonies, can develop the limitless resources of the continent which has been the cradle of their race; and, above all, that they can govern themselves prudently and self-reliantly,—and there will open up before the black man the assurance of a future as splendid and far-reaching as any that ever presented itself to a white conqueror."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1887#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Liberia is growing more and more indigenous and hopeful.

Our palm oil and camwood were the chief productions exported to the United States, but since kerosene and cotton seed oil have come prominently to the front there, the exports of palm oil to that country have become almost nil compared with what it used to be. In those days it was not an uncommon thing for a single ship to take, among other products, palm oil to the value of 28,000 dols. to 36,000 dols. The vacancy caused by the decline of the trade of this article in the United States has not been filled. Your figures with reference to the export of coffee into the United States have been carefully scanned. We are entirely in accord as to the fact that our trade in this article might be increased to much larger proportions, and the quantity exported to the United States might be multiplied a hundred fold. Yet when the facts of the culture being in its infancy and of there being no banks nor other financial institutions to assist the growers, and no machinery, except in a few instances, are considered, I am of the opinion that our cultivators have made a tolerable good showing in foreign markets. The total product for 1887 was about 1,200,000 lbs., which are distributed as follows: to Germany, 606,000 lbs.; United States, 301,000 lbs.; Belgium, France, and England, 149,000 lbs.; Holland and 150,000 lbs.""\n\nBishop William Taylor, in his Quadrennial Report, states: ""The productive interests of Liberia are fairly prosperous. Within ten miles of Monrovia, up the St. Paul\'s river, there are ten steam sugar-cane crushing mills, and during the past year more than 600,000 lbs. of coffee have been exported from Monrovia.""\n\nThe fact should be noted that, by act of the national Parliament of Brazil in May, slavery was abolished throughout the Empire. For years a popular feeling in favour of emancipation has been growing; but now the government has suddenly moved in the matter and the glorious deed is done. This act is one in which philanthropists and Christians may well rejoice, and it will have an important bearing on the interests of the kingdom of Christ in Brazil and in Africa.

Having failed in an attempt to settle at Sherbro, they sought and found refuge on Providence Island, at the mouth of the Mesurado river, and finally on Cape Mesurado, where now stands the capital of the republic.\n\nThe second decade, commencing with 1830, might be called the period of expansion, when the colony at Cape Mesurado feeling itself sufficiently well established began to send out colonies, and planted the settlements at Bassa and Sinoe on the coast, and Millsburg and Caldwell on the St. Paul's.\n\nThe third decade, commencing with 1840, might be called the period of consolidation or independence. During this period the necessity was pressed upon the scattered settlements of not only closely co-operating but of declaring themselves one independent state under the name and style of the Republic of Liberia. It was during this period that the last white governor died, and the colonial Government was assumed and conducted (for five years) by one of the colonists under the direction of the American Colonization Society until July, 1847, when the colony became an independent Republic.\n\nThe fourth decade commences with 1850, and might be called the period of diplomatic extension. It was during this period that most of our treaties with foreign nations were formed, and we became known to the European world.\n\nThe fifth decade begins with 1860, and might be called the agricultural period.

What has been already done by Liberians in sugar and coffee cultivation, and other branches of agricultural industry, is invaluable under these circumstances, as showing what an admirable field there is in Liberia for the judicious employment of capital under a settled government. There is a large aboriginal population ready for employment by those who may possess the means of payment for labour, not only in planting and securing crops, but in those indispensable accessories in new countries—the formation of roads, improving the navigation of rivers, and introducing that machinery which adds so much to the efficiency of manual labour. For all these accessories, capital realized elsewhere is absolutely necessary. Without that capital in the hands of the community, the government of Liberia has been, like the fabled Tantalus, surrounded by the life-giving element, but unable to appropriate it for its own use and safety. It has been suffering from a painful thirst of revenues which can only be supplied by the development of natural resources, and the opening up and utilizing land and water routes of communication with the interior, by means of which the produce of the soil may be conveyed with speed and at moderate cost to its sea-ports for shipment to the European and American markets.

In the same way that what has been done in the path of Christian civilisation at the British settlements along the coast has been done by agencies and help from England, so all that has been done in Liberia has been done through United States influences, and with United States devotion, and labour, and money.

As she is now, she wants much, very much, without which progress is slow, difficult, and painful. Her revenues are really insufficient for very modest requirements of government; for what is 30,000l. a-year for a country undefined as regards the interior, with 600 miles of seaboard, and 600,000 heathen aborigines?

Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary. Here at present the great Mahommedan Chief Samadu is the actual ruler, and has created one of those African empires which are easily reared by successful robbers with extravagant bloodshed and widespread depredation. Samadu has several times fought the French on the Senegambian frontier, but of late he is said to have concluded peace with them. The productions of Sierra Leone are those of true Western Africa, and the colony is rich and well-favoured in vegetable wealth. It exports palm oil, palm kernels, rubber, gum, camwood, besides skins and benniseed and ground nuts.\n\nLiberia is British in language, and to a great extent in such culture as it possesses, although it enjoys an independent Government. But its native inhabitants, the Kru-boys, are under the delusion that they are British subjects ""of a sort,"" and do not admit any political connexion with the Americanised negroes who claim to govern them. On the east of Liberia, between the frontier and the west boundary of the French Gold Coast, is the Ivory Coast, about 100 miles in extent, and one of the last portions of the African coast, which remains unclaimed, unprotected, and unannexed by any European Power. Such trade as is done with it is purely British, and is chiefly with the town of Bristol. Its inhabitants are allied to the Kru races of Liberia.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Obstacles to Progress in Liberia', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—It is more than thirty years since I immigrated to this country, and ever since I can remember there has always been a sort of drag in everything. We are kept down in this place next to servitude; our will is not our own; a few men who are in command of a little property keep us knuckle down to them. If we are in their employment we are seldom paid in money, but are obliged to take up such estables as they choose to give us. If a captain or supercargo comes, and wishes to give some of the enterprising young men of this place a little trust, these merchants here, though doing business on trust themselves, will oppose it, and advise the parties not to give them trust. If any of us try to do a little trading whereby we may progress, we are opposed, oppressed, and all kind of stratagems will be used to prevent our success. Hence we are living here not in harmony and love; every man is opposed to the progress of his neighbour in whatever pursuit he follows; whether it be in the mercantile line or farming, it seems as a dagger driven into us to see any one else prosper; very few sympathise with their fellow-citizen when misfortune happens to him, and fewer still will give any aid except for a large reward. Even the immigrants who are invited by us from America to come and help us to build up this black nationality, when they come out, except they possess a little money, are looked down upon with disdain and contempt by the other citizens; any advantages that can be taken of them will be taken. Sometimes we may be paid by the merchants when we are in their employment in Liberian currency, and if without leaving the store we give them back the currency for the purchase of some article in their store, they refuse to take the very currency they paid us, demanding specie of us; and if they do take it, it will be at a discount; and when foreigners come here to reside among us to do business, whether they be our colour or white men, whereby we can get articles cheaper, be employed, and the country built up for our benefit, the majority of people are against them, and they will try everything in their power to entrap them in law-suits; they will go to their places of business, abuse, insult, curse and swear at them, and some of our young men, when in the employment of foreigners, will skulk away a part of their time in idleness; and if their employers bring them up for it they will question their authority in doing so, and begin to speak of their freedom, and demand full pay for the time they have wasted in idleness; and if the foreigners refuse to pay them they are taken to law and made to pay, for our laws, Mr. Editor, are all one-sided. No foreigners or new-comers expect to get justice in Liberia; if they do, they will certainly drain the pockets well first. Whether this is done from the ignorance of the people, or whether they are influenced by the few merchants here, I cannot say; one thing I know, that this is a practice in the Republic, to take all advantage they can of foreigners, that they may be discouraged and leave the country. I am a supporter of foreigners, for without foreigners we cannot live. America receives into her country immigrants of all nations. The Dutchman finds a home and welcome; he brings with him skill and science, and puts them in operation. The Frenchman, the Englishman, the German, and Italian find welcome hands beckoning them to come; therefore America has advanced to what she is this day. Why can\'t Liberia stretch out her hands to all nations, and invite them into her country? Why can\'t Liberia open her ""Constitution,"" and allow all nations to come in and build her up? Why do Liberians take advantage of foreigners and strangers, and combine together against them? These are the things that keep us from progressing. Since our Government was a Government it has been in an embarrassed state; never was Liberia able to redeem her currency in gold and silver, as she reports.

There were three major contending forces in the Scramble for Bechuanaland (now Botswana). These were the four Bechuanaland rulers (the rulers of the Kwena, the Ngwato, the Ngwaketse and the Tswana) and their missionary allies who wanted British imperial protection and trusteeship; the Transvaal Boers who looked upon Bechuanaland as their natural hinterland for land, livestock, minerals and labour; and the Cape colonists, represented by Rhodes, who wanted to forestall Boer expansion and alliance with the Germans in South West Africa (now Namibia). The African rulers, like Moshoeshoe, sought to forestall settler colonial rule by acquiring pro› tectorate status. When alarmed by a dissident sect of the Dutch Reformed Church in the Transvaal - the Doppers - who wanted to cross through Tswana territories to Damaraland in 1876, Kgama, king of the Ngwato section of the Tswana, had written to the 'Great Queen of the English People' requesting protection. He wanted to know the conditions for protection and he emphasized that the relationship would be guided by 'Christian morality'. Furthermore, his rival brother, Kgamane, had settled in the Transvaal with his followers and was fighting with the Boers in the hope of gaining the Ngwato throne (see Fig. 9.1).\nThe British were bitterly divided over Bechuanaland. The RhodesRobinson group wanted to eliminate the imperial factor in favour of settler colonialism - including joint annexation by the Cape and the Transvaal, which only failed because the Transvaal refused. But the MackenzieWarren humanitarian-imperialist groups, like the African rulers, wanted to forestall settler colonialsim, because they were opposed to the brutality and destructiveness of settler colonialism over their Tswana Christian converts and church schools.

They believed in the unquestionable superiority of the white race, culture and religion, and they viewed colonization, commerce and Christianity as inseparable allies. At the same time they also emphasized the need for imperial responsibility (paternal guardianship) over the Africans. They sought to smooth cultural contact between the colonizer and the colonized and to 'protect' and 'civilize' the African in an effort to make him a more useful member of the new colonial community.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust.

The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy. Asante must remain as of old at the same time to remain friendly with all white men.

A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation.

If they were less farsighted, less fortunate or less well-advised, they would see their traditional enemies siding with the invader and would themselves assume an attitude of resistance, which could all too easily end in military defeat, the deposition of chiefs, the loss of land to the native allies of the occupying power, possibly even to the political fragmen› tation of the society or state ...

This, of course, would not be tolerated in that age, and using the killing of the British acting consul-general and five other Englishmen on their way to Benin as an excuse, the British launched a punitive expedition of 1500 men against Benin in 1897. Though the Oba himself would have liked to submit, a majority of his chiefs raised an army to beat back the invasion. They were, however, defeated and the capital was looted of its precious bronze treasures and then burnt. 48 In the Niger Delta, as in many other areas of Nigeria, the British had signed treaties of protection with most of the chiefs by 1884. However, while some, like Calabar and Bonny, had allowed missionaries to operate in their states, others had not. Moreover, all of them were insisting on their sovereign rights to regulate trade and to levy duties on British traders. This, the new British consuls, such as Hewett and Johnston, would not tolerate. A typical example of the rulers who stood up to the British consuls and missionaries was Jaja of Opobo (see Plate 6.3). He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order. When Jaja still refused to comply in spite of Johnston's threats to bombard his town with British gunboats, Johnston enticed Jaja on board a ship in 1887 under a promise of safeconduct but arrested him and sent him to Accra$^{49}$ where he was tried and deported to the West Indies.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome.

This was already noticeable in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era.

This approach fails to consider the prevailing circumstances under which various groups or individuals operated. The options available to them and their interpretations of these options may have been different from those imposed on them by politicians and scholars alike. It makes sense, as Boahen has suggested, to see the events of the time and their key actors in terms of diplomacy, pursued independently or backed by force. To appreciate the extent to which diplomacy could go, it is necessary to understand the socio-economic forces operating in a particular society at the time of the encounter. For East Africa, a survey of such factors in the 1890s will be an appropriate setting for the events that followed. But, as R. I. Rotberg and Ali Mazrui state: 'There is no gainsaying that the introduction of Western norms and power and accompanying controls was everywhere in Africa questioned by the people affected'. 2 This questioning, however, took various forms. 'The response to the in› vasion was determined by the structure of each society at the time.

In such societies, response to foreign penetration tended to be dictated by the king or the leadership as a whole. What had existed in Europe at one time - 'The religion of the king is my religion' - sums up the attitude well. Other societies, such as the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika or the Nandi in Kenya were in the process of forming centralized governments. This process is often referred to as state formation.

We at least have striven to do our part of the duty. Nor are we in any way responsible for the comparatively small support that we have received. If our appeals to the Government for remedies, and to our fellow-subjects for help, have been but little heeded, we are not to blame. The fact is, that the deep and awful responsibility of this country as regards Africa has never yet been felt by the public conscience. Do we appeal to it about the slave-trade, the reply is, ""Our Government is endeavouring to put it down."" And if, in view of the misdirection or insufficiency of the efforts being made, we turn to the Government, we are told that the country would not approve of even an extra one thousand pounds of annual expense in Africa. This shifting the responsibility of the work from one to the other is unworthy of us as a Christian people; and it is as short-sighted as it is unworthy. Africa need not come as a beggar for her due. God has made her rich. It is only the devil who keeps her poor. We were poor enough when we virtually worshipped him with Druidical rites and sacrifices. The only difference between the ancient Briton and the modern African is, that the one was white and painted, and that the other is black and greased. It was not the Gospel alone that regenerated Britain. Rome—Pagan Rome—brought her what Christian England has had no thought about giving to Africa. She brought her her roads and the elements of industry and progress; she brought her highways for the Gospel to travel over; she brought her recesses within the light of the only civilization the world then knew of. And this is all that Africa wants; what dethroned the devil here will dethrone him in Africa. Texts of Scripture alone will not do it. We do not say they could not, but we say they will not. We have no right to expect them to do it. As undoubtedly the most advanced Christian people in the world—and moreover a maritime Christian people—the heathen have been given to us in charge for enlightenment. Every source of power that God has given to us in addition to Christian truth and precepts is to be used with the Gospel. We do but a small portion of our duty when we send Africa only the latter. We do but little more when we send her only that commerce which yields immediate profitable return to the individuals who direct it. What we ought to do is, to set heartily about removing the removable obstacles that keep Africa from light and truth, and wealth and civilization. Not by squandering money—by sowing it broadcast over Africa; but by drilling it in carefully, where every seed sown can be tended until harvest. And now, at the beginning of the year 1863, we renew our protest both with Government and people against things being conducted by us in Africa as hitherto. We demand Christian example, as well as Christian effort, in Africa. We demand governors who will not think coloured prostitutes necessary co-inhabitants of their official abode. We demand officials who will not buy of their parents the black half-converted maidens out of the missionary schools, to be their concubines. We demand judges who will not take up their abode with one of the parties in a cause to be tried before them, and give their countenance to the grossest vices. We demand that where there is British official occupation there shall be a real British civilising effort; that where the digging of wells will ensure a pure supply of water, the officials shall not content themselves with filtering that which they require for their own use, and leave the ignorant and, if you so please, lazy natives to drink the foul and contaminating liquid full of vegetable decomposition and inert life, which carries poison and disease into their body, until worms force their way out through its flesh. We demand that occupation shall be an industrial reality, instead of a mere administrative farce. We demand that slavery and polygamy be cautiously, but incessantly and firmly discouraged and repressed; that human sacrifices and the sale of slaves be nowhere permitted under the British flag; that all lands be declared vested in the Crown for adjustment of title and regulating beneficial occupation; that the clearing of the country and formation of roads around and from occupied posts be commenced and steadily proceeded with; that the British flag be kept constantly flying on rivers where it may be so kept flying without an improper sacrifice of life; that where the Government cannot itself act directly in any of these matters, it shall give open countenance and assistance to those whose efforts are directed to the furtherance of these objects.'}, {'id': 5518, 'article_title': 'The African Times.', 'full_section_title': 'The African Times.', 'last_edit_date': '04-01-1887', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1887#article-10', 'issue_date': '01_04_1887', 'content': ""fain consider themselves Heaven's chosen instruments to work the regeneration of the Dark Continent.

But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.\nIn the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium. Major Christian missionary bodies such as the Church Missionary Society (CMS) of the Church of England and the Lyons-based SociØtØ des Missions Africaines (SMA) of the Roman Catholic Church each employed a mix of European nationals. Father Boghero, who led the SMA in an effort to re› introduce Roman Catholic Christianity to West Africa in the nineteenth century, was an Italian. The pioneer SMA Fathers in most parts of the area which became Nigeria were French, just as it was such British missionaries as Thomas Birch Freeman of the Methodists and Samuel Ajayi Crowther of the CMS who pioneered the work of Christian missions in what was to become French Dahomey (present-day People's Republic of Benin).$^{33}$ British, French, German and Portuguese traders set up businesses adjacent to one another and, as the case of Badagry clearly demonstrated, there were residential quarters for diverse European nationals in the major ports all along the coast of the Bight of Benin.\nTraders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > The beginnings of the Scramble', 'content': ""Although by the end of the third quarter of the nineteenth century, the European powers of France, Britain, Portugal and Germany had acquired commercial interests and were exercising considerable influence in different parts of Africa, their direct political control there was extremely limited.

'Refusals to annex', it has been remarked perceptively, 'are no proof of reluctance to control'.$^{34}$ This explains both the attitudes of Salisbury and Bismarck and indeed of most of the major actors in the partition.\nBut this attitude began to change as a result of three major events which occurred between 1876 and 1880. The first was the new interest which the Duke of Brabant, crowned a constitutional king (Leopold I) of the Belgians in 1865, proclaimed in Africa. This was signified by the so-called Brussels Geographical Conference which he convened in 1876 and which resulted in the setting up of the African International Association and the employment of H. M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

Thus Indian traders were not only allowed, but, to some extent, were also encouraged to patronize trade in East Africa, and to some extent in Central Africa.

The 'dislike and distrust of the Levantine communities' in West Africa, which Professor Bauer noticed to be 'marked in official circles', 71 was a relatively recent development. Real hostility towards the Levantines, mostly Lebanese, came not from official circles but from the various European agents of commercial firms, and such hostility was in response to effective trade rivalry presented by the Levantines.$^{72}$ And where British firms appear to have been given preference, it was not because of their respectability, but because they could - with the blessing of the British government - act as effective pressure groups and influence colonial policy› makers. 73 Still, Ehrlich's generalization that 'administrative attitudes, throughout British Africa, rarely encouraged indigenous commercial initiative'$^{74}$ is quite valid. But other factors stifled local initiatives. First of all, general official policy, as would be expected in a colonial situation, was geared primarily towards the advancement of imperialist interests. Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction. By the first decade of the twentieth century, following the construction of railways, European firms were squeezing African traders in two related ways. Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

In most cases it was labour, and not land, which was the scarcer means of production.\nForeigners, mostly British, secured and held concessions on land with mineral and timber resources, but such arrangements had little adverse effect on the local agricultural communities.

Lovett Cameron, R.N., on ""Africa.""\n\nThe lecturer said that the further British influence extended in Africa the more would slavery of every kind be done away with. Besides illegal slavery, there was extensively practised in Africa a system of native despotism which it was very desirable should be abolished. In 1876 nobody seemed to take any notice of Africa, and the exportation of India-rubber from Zanzibar amounted to something under £20,000. Now the amount was about £250,000! With respect to ill-health in that continent, he had found that some of the native treatments were by no means to be despised, and many of our English doctors could take a leaf out of their book. The record of men who had travelled through Africa and endured every conceivable kind of hardship proved that Africa had been cursed by the idea of its unhealthiness, a reproach which it did not deserve. The great thing required, however, was adequate communication. African travelling, under present circumstances, meant, at the outside, fifty miles in a week. At the present time every mile of railroad laid down in Africa drove a dozen nails into the coffin of the slave-trade, to say nothing of the immense impetus to trade and commerce which would thus be afforded. From Cairo right away to the Albert Nyanza was navigable water. There would be no difficulty in overcoming the obstacles of cataracts, &c., which modern engineering would easily surmount. The central high plateau of Africa was, to a great extent, in British hands, and offered the most important means of repressing the slave-trade in future. Every slave working at the present time was in direct defiance of the Act of 1873. Mr. Rhodes\' great railway, which would reach Zambesia within eight years, should be kept under British control, as native treaties were more or less uncertain. In 1876 they could have obtained all that is now German territory by holding up their hands. The Germans, however, are practically locked in. A dispute had been going on with Portugal as to whether the Zambesi was an open highway. Fortunately, owing to the twenty-one miles strip of land granted by England to Germany these two powers would be as one on the question, and in future arbitration claim the Zambesi as an open highway. A wise system of emigration should be conducted. He would like to see Indian planters transferred there, and Chinese too. Africa offered an excellent opening for the English working man, and it was desirable that the Government should protect its emigrants. The dangers of Africa were largely dwelt on nowadays, and its advantages were put in the rear. This was the reason why the development of that great continent was so far behind hand.\n\nThe following resolution was proposed by Admiral Field, M.P., seconded by Mr. Johnson (of the Stanley Falls, Congo):—', 'last_edit_date': '1890-07-18', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1890#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Although the Lagos Colony extends on paper as far as the right bank of the Benin, no authority is exercised by the Lagos officials further east than Leki.

The Niger territories are under the administration of the Royal Niger Company, to whom a charter was granted about two years ago.

The inland limits of the Gold Coast colony are vague, and variable in extent. Behind our actual possessions, our political influence largely extends, and might be exercised much to the benefit of the interior were we less timorous about asserting it. In spite of several alterations in our Ashanti policy, we may consider the Ashanti kingdom as within the sphere of political influence. It would not be difficult to extend British influence from the Gold Coast right up to the great bend of the Niger, and thus secure them to British commercial influence. When we think of how much has been effected in the consolidation and extension of our Gold Coast territories since 1871, we may confidently hope for a further extension and a great future for this rich and important possession. The littoral of the Gold Coast is of the same moist equatorial character in its climate and scenery. The typical West African forest country ends, however, on the northern frontiers of Ashanti, and the characteristic park-like grass land scenery of Central Africa begins in the plains through which the Upper Volta flows. Beyond the Volta and the countries of Gyaman, Ashanti, and Brono, the inhabitants are mainly Mahommedans, and belong to a stock related to the Mandingos, although there is a large infusion of immigrant Hausa traders and fighting men. In some of these lands a proportion of the Hausa constabulary of the Gold Coast is recruited. Although the inhabitants of the Gold Coast belong almost entirely to what may be called the Ashanti family, yet increasingly the Hausa language is becoming the commercial tongue of the natives, although English has a great hold and is extending. The influence of the Hausa, no doubt, is aided by the presence of the constabulary, who are either recruited on the Niger or at the back of the Gold Coast.

I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain. If we gave away the Gold Coasts or Lagos, or the Niger, for instance, in exchange for concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or the North Atlantic, the ratio of loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be far greater than the gain to the Australians or the Newfoundlanders. To those who argue that our missionaries and merchants might go on working in West Africa just the same, even if the rule in our possession were transferred to another Power, I would ask, \'How many British merchants are there in French Senegambia? What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value. Then as to Zanzibar and British East Africa, they, in their turn, besides securing the southern approach to the dominions of our Egyptian ward, are a necessity to the trade and overflow emigration of our great Indian Empire, with its nearly 300,000,000 of people and its yearly trade with the British Empire of some £90,000,000. The trade of the British Empire with British Africa amounts to about £25,200,000 yearly. Among the more valuable products which British Africa sends us, or supplies to herself, may be cited the following: gold, silver, copper, coal, diamonds, ivory, rubber, palm oil, palm kernels, gums, cotton, dyewoods, indigo, coffee, sugar, rice, Indian corn, horses, cattle, donkeys, hides, amomum seeds, red peppers, and many other valuable dyes, spices, oils, timber, drugs, skins, and farinaceous foods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'British Influence on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following letter has been addressed recently to Earl Granville by the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, on behalf of the African Trade Section of that Chamber:—\n\n""My Lord,—I am requested by the Council of this Chamber to ask that your serious consideration may be given to the following facts, many of which are doubtless well known to you, but which have a special significance owing to the position of matters in West Africa at the present time. The British protectorate, as you are aware, is extended over a large portion of the Coast of Africa, which stretches from the settlement of Sierra Leone to the district of the Niger. Upon this coast, excluding the State of Liberia and the neighbourhood of Whydah, the port of Dahomey, there are three French settlements—viz., Grand Bassam, Assinie, and Porto Novo; also portions of coast unprotected by any European Power. West of Grand Bassam there is unoccupied coast of considerable extent; east of Lagos, beyond Leckie, and reaching to Old Calabar, there is the important territory at the mouths of the Niger. Quite recently the Germans have taken certain ports on this coast—viz., Ahgweh, Bageida, and Little Popo. At these there was a thriving and increasing British trade, and with the chiefs of Ahgweh and Little Popo treaties had been made on behalf of Her Majesty, securing the right of British subjects to trade on equal terms with those of any other nation. The occupation by France and the late annexations by Germany break the continuity of the British protectorate; there is an increasing conflict of the various national interests, and the influence of the British authorities with the natives is being lessened; the introduction of different principles of trading will also seriously affect the prosperity of British commerce. It is important to mention in this connexion that the duties upon spirits, arms, and ammunition levied in the British settlements furnish the greater portion of the Government revenue. In German and French settlements these articles are known, in most cases, to be free of duty, and being sold to a great extent in the same markets as the British imports, competition becomes difficult, and the loss to the British revenue and trade must ultimately be great. The Chamber would suggest, therefore, that while negotiations regarding African territories are pending, something might be done in the way of exchange or by mutual concession to induce Germany, at least, to withdraw from those newly acquired ports where British trade had become established, and where German rivalry upon different principles is likely to be so injurious. This Government might also be requested to take into consideration the question of the extension of the British protectorate to the unprotected portion of the coast named.—I am, &c.,\n\n""C. B.

It is a fact well within the knowledge of all interested in the welfare of the oldest British colony in Africa that for some years past the French, by means of treaties made with the chiefs of the Upper Niger and Western Soudan, have been gradually encroaching upon the hitherto not very well-defined boundaries of the Colony of Sierra Leone, with the result of gradually reducing the British sphere of influence, and at the same time narrowing the field from which the merchants and traders of that Colony draw their native produce, and in which, in return, they have been in the habit of finding a market for their imported goods. Rather more than two years ago, an agreement was concluded at Paris between our Government and that of France with regard to the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence in West Africa. The territories referred to in the agreement were Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast. It was provided that the two Governments should have the right of appointing special Commissions of Delimitation ""to trace upon the spot, wherever they may consider it necessary, the line of demarcation between the English and French possessions"" in conformity with the agreement. The work of determining the boundary line between Senegambia and Sierra Leone is now about to be begun, the British Commissioners having left Liverpool on Saturday last. For some time past British merchants interested in commerce with Sierra Leone have been apprehensive that their trade with the interior might be seriously interfered with, if not absolutely ruined, by a wrongful definition of the boundary.

By this new agreement the boundaries of the ""spheres of influence"" of these two States have been definitely arranged, and a troublesome controversy thereby removed.

To this cause, principally, may be attributed the popularity of propositions for the immediate occupation of vast areas of Central Africa. Two minor causes have contributed to this movement.

The Force Publique of the Belgian Congo, exhibiting the qualities both of occupation army and police force, was frequently used during this era to quell resistance expressed in the form of syncretistic religious movements.$^{29}$ On the scale of open warfare, events can be easily measured. The Italian campaign to subdue Libya in the 1920s and the Spanish and French effort to resolve the Rïf war in Morocco in the same period are obvious. But they are surpassed in scope by the rapacious war undertaken by Mussolini against the Ethiopians, an event with which the period here under consideration was tragically closed.\nThis account of military developments in Africa in the inter-war period does not seriously impair the assertion that divergent intentions of European colonial method and practice are those which, in retrospect, seem the most significant. There is little doubt that colonial bureaucratiza› tion did provide partial preparation for an unintended movement towards national independence. The configurations of a new political elite were slowly emerging, as lower-echelon clerks and appointed chiefs in various colonial services - but particularly the British - were learning to apply, if only modestly, Napoleon's imperative: 'careers open to talent'. Training schools, such as the Ecole William Ponty in Dakar, were undertaking the preparation of educators and administrators upon whom the colonial administration was more and more to depend.

In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa.

Barely ten years after the event, for example, a son might give details of his father's battles which the latter knew nothing about, though, from then on, he would knit them into his account in all good faith. The colonial version, though contemporaneous with the events, is not perfect; it is tainted with the hostility that existed in the armies of the colonial powers between metropolitan and colonial regiments.

The slave trade had intensified internecine warfare for over two centuries, leading to cultural devastation on an unprecedented scale. Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent. Different methods of foreign control or interaction with the African populace naturally evoked or created different cultural responses from the displaced African. Belgian and Portuguese colonialism, as well as British settler colonialism in East Africa, are easily recognized as the most ruthless on the continent. They created conditions for the truly displaced African in the most literal sense of the word.

It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.\nJohn D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty.

This general pattern is complicated somewhat by the Nguni adoption of Tumbuka as the national language and the subsequent Tumbuka cultural renaissance, which suggests that many of the subject people only superficially adopted Nguni culture. 94 Although a discussion of the effects which the Mfecane had on the existing patterns of social stratification is conspicuously absent from the literature, fragmentary evidence suggests the growth of new classes within the Nguni kingdoms. During the expansive phase, a military aristocracy consisting of the regimental commanders and their principal subordinates emerged. Their power was based primarily upon the tribute and plunder which they acquired - especially the herds of cattle and captives, some of which they redistributed to their followers.

""I know of nothing so debasing,"" says he, ""as cowardice in a people."" Yet of the three peoples whose courage he extols he attributes the possession of it in the first to fear (the Ashantees), in the second to pride (the Zulus), and in the third to bigotry (the Soudanese).\n\nIn the first place, the writer has something to say about the West Coast natives as soldiers. Of the old slave-recruited West India regiments, he entertains a high opinion. The African slave had two great merits as a soldier—derived from his instinct as a savage and his training as a slave. The instinct of some breeds of dogs renders it easy to teach them their special work, which other species, though equally intelligent, cannot be effectively taught. The wild tribes dependent upon hunting for their daily food possess a sort of intuitive knowledge of wild animals, of their ways and habits, which give them an immense advantage over the ordinary town-bred soldier. The trapper\'s life of hardship and privation fits him physically for the ups and downs and rough usage which war brings with it. The hunter is already half a soldier, and not only accepts the miseries of war in an uncomplaining spirit, but regards them as the ordinary incidents of everyday life. The African in our West India regiments has always displayed that childlike affection for, and implicit reliance upon, the officers who treated him well, which is so marked a feature in the character of the negro slave. A certain governor, finding that his servants were given to robbing him, had orders given to the sentry before his door that no one was to be allowed out carrying any parcel with him. Shortly afterwards the governor himself put some papers up to take with him to the judge\'s house. But the sentry would not allow him to pass with the offending despatch-box. He said his ""copral"" had told him not to allow anyone with a bundle to pass, and the ""copral\'s"" order was law. Since the old slave days, the *personnel* of the West India regiments has, Lord Wolseley thinks, declined. The infusion of white blood into the negro race has weakened its strength and impaired his courage. The only countervailing advantage is that civilisation has made him more teachable. The man who has been educated in Barbados to read his Bible and has learned to sing hymns, acquires a knowledge of drill more easily than the released slave who came from Equatorial Africa.'}, {'id': 6873, 'article_title': 'ITEMS OF WEST AFRICAN NEWS.', 'full_section_title': 'ITEMS OF WEST AFRICAN NEWS.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1897#article-0', 'issue_date': '01_12_1897', 'content': 'The British & African Co\'s steamer ""Accra"" arrived at Liverpool on Nov. 10 from West Africa with mails and passengers. She left Old Calabar on Oct. 9 and met the Protectorate gunboat Ivy coming in with the King of Benin on board. The King had been round in the steamer to most of the rivers in the Protectorate. When the Accra left Lagos on Oct. 15, the West India troops were still in the town as carriers could not be got for them. Fifteen hundred carriers were required, and, up to the time of leaving, only 300 had been obtained. The French at Porto Novo were pressing the Natives into their service, and all able-bodied men in the villages round the town were being forced to go up into the interior with their troops. The French at Porto Novo were also contemplating putting a tax on produce which was sent from Porto Novo to Lagos for shipment. The produce in question comes down the Lagoon from Porto Novo and is shipped to England and the continent. This tax is to compel the shippers instead of sending the produce through the British Colony, to send it to Kotonu, the French port. Captain Creighton, A.D.C. to Governor M\'Callum, was at Ibadan recruiting Natives for a new battalion of troops. The new troops were to be called the Yoruba battalion, and were to be 1,000 strong. The authorities at Ibadan were assisting the British to recruit able-bodied men. Mr. Fuller had been appointed British Resident at Ibadan, succeeding Capt. Bower. Governor M\'Callum had had another attack of fever, but had recovered when the Accra passed. It was reported that the Governor himself intended going up into the hinterland with the troops. Information from the interior received at Lagos said that the French when they got into the Saki were told by the chiefs of that place that it belonged to the English. They however would not retire, but sent an expedition against Ilesha. The Natives of Ilesha gave the French such a reception that they had to retire defeated with several killed and wounded.\n\nThe French Commander was wounded by arrows. Subsequently the French left Saki and occupied Kissi. As the French went through the English territory on the march from Porto Novo it is reported that they seized British subjects and pressed them into their service as carriers.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Some Facts About the Hausas', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The Hausa Native is perfectly black, but he does not possess such thick lips or such curly hair as we are accustomed to associate with the ordinary negro. He is naturally a trader rather than a soldier, but when trained, as he has frequently been down on the coast, by English officers, he is more than a match for any other Native. The Governor of the Gold Coast told me that in a battle the Hausas appeared utterly devoid of fear, and that the only difficulty was to restrain them. It would not infrequently happen that a small body of Hausas, having defeated the enemy to whom they were opposed, would pursue them to a considerable distance from the scene of battle, and perhaps stop to raid their village before returning to look after or assist their companions. It is hard for anyone who has not actually seen Hausa porters to believe the weights which they are accustomed to carry. While staying at Lokoja, the officer in command of the Royal Niger Company's Hausa troops pointed out to me a mountain gun lying on the ground, and asked me if I could lift it. With considerable difficulty I succeeded in raising it about an inch off the ground. He then told me that one of their Hausa soldiers was regularly accustomed to carry this gun on his head. On my appearing somewhat incredulous, he had the man sent for, and told him to put the gun upon his head, which he proceeded to do, and walked for some little distance with it. The officer told me that on one occasion he had been known to carry this gun twenty-two miles in the day. If you ask a Hausa why his people are so strong, he will tell you that it is because of the different food which he eats. The tribes in the Niger delta and near the sea coast live for the most part on yams and bananas, which are produced with the minimum amount of labour. The Hausas live almost entirely on guinea-corn, a species of millet, which has a very minute and hard red grain. This is ground up by the natives, and, mixed with water, makes a sort of porridge, which has, however, a most disagreeable sour taste."", 'last_edit_date': '1897-01-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_01_1897#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.617, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SURGEONS FOR THE GOLD COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Army Medical Department has been advertising in the daily papers for assistant surgeons to serve on the West Coast of Africa—at Sierra Leone, the Gambia, and the Gold Coast.\n\nWe feel that this advertisement for assistant surgeons calls for especial notice from us.

The cities were surrounded by walls and ditches, a large proportion of the young men followed the business of war, and all able-bodied men were liable to be called upon to protect their homesteads. In spite of these drawbacks, Yorubaland was well and widely cultivated, thickly inhabited, and full of local commercial activity. The price of food prevailing throughout Yoruba would show how industrious were the people and how rich its soil. Maize in the grain sold in the public market place at 6d. per cwt., large yams at 3d. a dozen, sweet potatoes at 1½d. per cwt., beans at 1s. 6d. a cwt., and eggs at from ¾d. to 2d. a dozen, while the most expensive luxuries of beef and mutton were sold for less than 1d. a pound, goats from 2s. 6d. each, sheep from 7s. to 8s., fowls for 3s. a score, and the small cattle of the country from 30s. to £2 10s. each. For 40 cowries—four-fifths of a halfpenny—his wife were in the habit of receiving a good meal. The city of Ibadan was the capital of Yoruba, the London of Negroland. It was surrounded by 163 farming villages, and was estimated to have a population of 250,000, while within the walls of the city 120,000 people were gathered. Other considerable towns were found at distances of a day\'s journey from one another. The trails throughout the country were kept in order by the farmers and villagers. Yoruba held out good prospects of commercial development, for the natives were not only industrious agriculturists for the purpose of supplying their daily wants in food, but they were also a people whose standard of comfort led them to spend much labour in raising and preparing luxuries which could be more cheaply supplied to them from Europe. Backed by the authority of the leading men in the country, he was able by personal inspection to satisfy himself as to the stock of cloth owned by the people, and the quantity annually consumed. He found that, taking an average of rich and poor, an annual consumption of cotton, silk, grass, and mixture cloths existed amounted to not less than 30 yards for each male adult, 45 yards for each female adult, and 6 yards for each child. The Yorubas were a fully-clad race, who for fashion\'s sake were ashamed to appear in public unless gracefully draped with two or three ample cloths. The price of such goods varied from threepence to half-a-crown per yard. They were made of home grown materials, dyed with native dyes, and woven in narrow looms or frames out of yarn spun by hand. From careful calculation it appeared that 31,000,000 yards of cloth were annually consumed in Yoruba, of which 30,000,000 were of home manufacture. From this they would be able to realise the extent to which the people were engaged in the work of making their own garments. In Yoruba there was an immediate market for European goods worth half a million a year, and in return for those goods the people there had the will and the necessary amount of produce to put at least an equal value of trade into our hands. By opening up the rivers of navigable depth there was no doubt that the trade could at least be doubled. These natural waterways were unfortunately as completely choked by vegetation as the overland trade routes were blocked by a rank growth of middlemen. To the industrious and struggling Yorubas, an opening for their energies in the direction of commerce would be invaluable. The Government of this country had for some time been actively engaged in negotiating the opening of the trade routes to the interior by land and water without infringing upon the liberty of the tribes, who were much better left to manage their own affairs, and without using unwise or arbitrary measures. Could other tribes be persuaded, ""for a consideration,"" to relinquish their commercial blockade, which might or might not be quite within their legal rights, there was no doubt that they would be the first to profit by the access of prosperity which would follow. And the Yorubas would profit in no less a degree. Their warlike young men would find in trade an adventurous life well suited to their training, which at present unfitted them for more peaceful employment; a less limited supply of arms would restore the balance of power in the interior, and insure the safety of the coast, while the terrors of the slave trade would give way to a large extent to the more profitable occupations of commercial enterprise.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-07-06', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/06_07_1891#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SURGEONS FOR THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In our next number we shall continue our remarks on this highly-important subject.

Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down.

The missionaries know themselves how many congregations they have, and how many members of whom they cannot say that all are chaff. Besides there are lots of healthy houses built, the whole Bible, and other useful books are translated into these languages, so that our present missionaries need no more ""to pick up the languages word by word from the thick lips of the negro with great difficulty!""

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization? The Bible contains as good a code for the improvement of mind and manners as any book extant.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-16', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.601, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Social Conditions of the Congo', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dr. Zinkgraf also enters into the missionary question. He thinks the success of the missionaries in these regions is extremely small; the most they have to show in their schools is a negro of more modest behaviour, speaking some European language fluently, able to read and write, and rather more worthy of trust than his black brethren, not because he has become a ""true Christian,"" but because he has acquired some knowledge of morality and principles of truth and justice,—which things are the foundations of civilization, and have no special need of a Divine revelation. It is work which teaches him his value and the aim of his existence. ""This method is more practical than an education which relies principally on spiritual means, and is resorted to by the French Catholic missionaries; while the last-mentioned is the method of the English Protestants. The Catholic education tends to accustom the negro to regular and earnest work, and to acquire knowledge which he can turn to account. The English missionaries are apt to think themselves better than others because they consider schools and prayer of the highest importance. I do not wish to criticise these men, but I believe that outer form is with them too prominent, and they are too content if only their school-children can say a great many verses. A Catholic missionary at Saint Salvador told me that he did not dare to make his school-children work, because they did not do so in the English mission, and if he had insisted on it the children would naturally prefer the English. But in the Catholic missions generally the children are kept to work and accustomed to obedience, so that their relation to the whites is more or less that of the negroes in general, while the English missionaries treat them more like pets. The Catholic missionary teaches his religion practically and agreeably to circumstances, while the English missionary revels too much in intoxication of devotion.\n\n""As to the success of the missionaries in general, it must be said that, considering the sacrifices made, and the means employed, it is very small . . . though the missionaries themselves may perhaps think the contrary. But it is not to be supposed that, in the Coast district and the regions where the negroes have long associated with Europeans, and have been spoiled by them, their social position will ever be changed and improved by the missionaries alone."" Dr. Zinkgraf considers the members of the new Congo State to be the men destined to have a true and lasting influence on the social condition of the negroes, which ""will be affected not only by the laws of the new State, but also by the new European element that will be brought into the country.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1886#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.6, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Internal Condition of the Congo Free State', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'An Englishman lately returned to England after some years\' residence on the Congo, said with regard to the above interview: While all the cases referred have not come under my personal observation, I regret I am unable to deny the general charges of inefficiency and brutality made against the State officials. The chief object of the officers is to get rubber and ivory at any price rather than to civilise, and they make no scruples in setting one tribe against another, using the stronger as a catspaw to obtain the ivory from the weaker. Great loss of life is the result, and it is no wonder we hear at intervals of officers being massacred. In addition to the ivory in the Native villages, the river is closely watched. A canoe laden with ivory is seen coming down the river in the evening, and signals are made for the Natives to stop and bring in their goods on the usual terms—that is to say, at a much lower price than could be obtained from any independent trader. Of course, the Natives paddle away as fast as possible, whereupon they are at once fired on and either killed or compelled to bring in their ivory. Another serious matter—one which is attracting the attention of the British Government—is the wholesale recruiting by Belgian agents of British subjects in Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and Barbadoes. Although, as the result of representations made to the Colonial Governments concerned this is being gradually suppressed, at one time almost every ship brought a number of men who had entered into contracts with the State to act as labourers. Once in the Congo the word ""travailleur"" was erased, and ""soldat"" substituted. Comparatively few of these people ever return to the coast. They die in the interior, usually of starvation. The result of all this is that hundreds of miles of the country are desolate, and that the Natives are leaving for the French sphere.\n\nIt is only fair to say that the high officials on the coast are not wholly responsible for this, and that some slight attempt is made at Boma, for instance, to educate the children, and so forth. The interior is in a constant state of siege, and legitimate trade is stagnated. There can be no doubt that had the Congo people the power of cohesion, the Belgians would have long since been swept out of the country, and that the British and other foreigners, who are all classed as whites, would have shared a similar fate.

Three typical examples were James Africanus Horton who was born in 1835 in Sierra Leone, trained in Britain as a doctor from 1853 to 1859 and entered the West African Medical Service as a Staff Assistant Surgeon; Samuel Ajayi Crowther who was one of the first products of Fourah Bay College and the first African to be ordained as a Bishop of the Anglican Church; and James Johnson, that fiery intellectual and evangel¬ ist.28 Others included Broughton Davies, who qualified as a doctor in 1859, and Samuel Lewis, the lawyer, the first African to receive a knighthood.29 Liberia also produced a few intellectuals, among whom was Edward Wilmot Blyden, who was born in the West Indies. Slightly larger were the numbers in Nigeria and the Gold Coast. In Nigeria, the elite included people like Essien Ukpabio, D. B. Vincent (later known as Mojóla Agbebi), H. E. Macaulay, G. W.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.773, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'Both the new elite and the urban proletariat were important as agents making for change in rural colonial society, but the former were indis› putably the more important in the political, economic and social history of colonial Africa. Their greatest advantage over the traditional elite and the urban and rural masses lay in their literacy. The fact was that for the non-Muslim areas of Africa probably the most important single innovation of foreign rule was literacy. Even for the Islamized areas, the coming of literacy in the Roman script gave a new impetus to Muslim education. Literacy was for many African peoples a new magic, and was sought after as such and at all costs since it appeared to open the treasure house of the modern world. To know the amount of power, authority and influence which the first generation of African clerks, interpreters and teachers exercised is to have some idea of the spell which literacy cast over many African peoples. Literacy gave the elite access to the scientific and social thought of the western world, equipped them to enter into dialogue with the colonial powers over the destiny of Africa, and familiarized them with the social fashions of Europe which made their life style an example to be emulated by their less fortunate countrymen.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Christian missionary activities', 'content': 'In Southern Africa, even greater attention was paid to education than in other parts of Africa, thanks partly to the grants-in-aid that were given by the governments of the Cape and Natal during the period. It would appear that the educational activities of the missionaries had been far more successful than their evangelical activities by 1870.$^{18}$ Not only had many elementary or village schools been established but, from as early as the 1840s, teacher-training and secondary institutions were founded. The Glasgow Missionary Society, for instance, established a seminary at Lovedale in Natal in July 1841 to which an industrial department was attached. This taught masonry, carpentry, waggon-making and smithing, and from 1861 on, printing and book-binding.$^{19}$ The Roman Catholics had also established a convent of the Sisters of the Holy Family with a boarding school, primary school and home of refuge in Natal and another one in the Orange Free State by 1877. In 1868, the French missionaries established a teacher training institute at Amanzimtote and a seminary for girls at Inanda in Natal in the mid-i86os, and in 1880 the Anglicans established the St Albans College among the Zulu. 20 Probably even more far-reaching than that of the Islamic revolution was the impact of this Christian religious revolution on African societies. This was most obvious in the manner of life of the converted Africans. Apart from acquiring various technical skills, the Africans gained access to Euro› pean medical ideas, however rudimentary, while the traditional styles of architecture were improved upon and the wearing of Western-type clothing became more common.$^{21}$ Also, by condemning polygamy, belief in ances› tors, traditional gods and witchcraft, the missionaries weakened the tra› ditional basis of African societies as well as family relationships.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.71, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Emergence of the Western-educated elite', 'content': 'The greatest social impact of the missionary revolution, however, was the emergence of an educated elite in Africa.

Some were even of the servile class or were as yet unassimilated immigrants. This was because in such places it was members of these classes who first embraced western education, tried their hands at the new professions and moved to the urban centres while the traditional elite tended to stand back. But as soon as the benefits of western education and the new professions were demonstrated, members of the traditional elite also joined in. Some colonial powers, especially France and Britain, deliberately set out with varying results to encourage this belatedly awakened traditional elite group, for instance by establishing special schools for them. With the wealth they derived from their estates and/or their salaries as local authorities they were usually able to train their sons not only locally but also in higher institutions in Europe and America.\nIn some other parts of Africa, however, the traditional elite responded early to the call of western education and modern commercial ventures. In Egypt it was this class which took the lead in establishing western-type institutions. In Buganda this same class quickly recognized the advantages of western education and commercial farming. In Ethiopia they reacted in a similar manner to western education, sending their children to Europe and America to be educated. In this way they were able to retain the leadership of their countries.\nThus the fact that the ranks of the new elite contained people from different strata of society makes it risky to talk in easy terms of conflict between the new elite and the traditional rulers. In Sierra Leone and Liberia where for much of the period the new elites were made up of people who were not indigenous to these territories, there was an under› standable tendency for the elite communities of the coast to be in conflict and competition with the traditional societies of the interior. They were inclined to be contemptuous of the traditional leaders who in turn harboured an abiding suspicion of them.

He believed that teachers and preachers in the quantity required by the African population should come from that school, thereby breaking the total reliance for missionary and teaching personnel on overseas schools. In the meantime, Turner visited South Africa in 1898, consecrated Dwane as AME vicar-bishop and pro› claimed the intention of the Church to build an AME College second to none among 'previous missionary educational endeavors'. Dwane, in turn, talked of establishing 'The Turner Normal School at Queenstown' or 'The Wilberforce of the Dark Continent'.\nTurner devoted the entire issue of Voice of Missions for March 1899 to publicity for the South African College Campaign. In one article portray› ing the redemption of Africa as the 'American Negro's Burden', the specifi› cations of the College took shape: it would be a school for Africans, taught by Africans, founded and supported by the AME missionary department. The founding faculty would come from African students already studying at Wilberforce University, Morris Brown College, Howard University, and the Medical Department of Central State College at Nashville, Tennessee.\nThe issue of non-African direction and dominance in the Church move› ment proved, however, unendurable for Dwane. In 1899, he seceded from the AME-'Ethiopian' union and thus created a schism within the ranks of the black Church in South Africa. Trying to retrieve its missionary foothold in South Africa, the AME General Conference in 1900 appointed Levi Coppin as the first Resident Bishop. The Church, moreover, was aided in its work by Charlotte Manye, the Sotho student who had triggered the AME-Ethiopian affiliation in the first place. Manye returned from her American studies in 1901 and immediately picked up the South African College idea - by founding an AME mission school among the Pedi in the Eastern Cape. By 1908, Charlotte Manye Maxeke and her spouse had obtained enough money from the Missionary Department to buy land in Transvaal, build a hall (named after Bishop Coppin) and to move the school (now named Wilberforce Institution) to its permanent location at Evaton."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'New political trends', 'content': ""the country' and, finally, to develop and facilitate the working of the mineral and other resources of the country.

As Professor Lucy Mair and a number of other scholars have shown, some gained entry into that class because they had made money from either large-scale farming or business and could help to finance the political agitation of their better educated but poorer brethren.$^{6}$ Some cotton and coffee farmers of Uganda, cocoa farmers of western Nigeria and the Gold Coast, coffee farmers of Ivory Coast and groundnut farmers of Senegal and The Gambia were able to gain membership of the new elite class on grounds of their success in that profession. Similarly, in West Africa especially, where many indifferently educated Africans were able to interpose themselves as middlemen between the primary producers and the big European commercial companies, commercial success also provided a ready passport to the new elite status. There were, however, others who qualified for consideration as members of the elite because they controlled mass organizations like labour unions and could give the better-educated elite the kind of mass support which they needed to convince the colonial powers that they spoke for the people. On the contrary, in East and Central Africa relatively few Africans gained admission into the elite group as a result of the deliberate policies pursued by the colonial rulers and the activities of the Indians and Portuguese and Greek petty traders. In fact, in many of these areas, the old central elite virtually disappeared.\nIt is largely this wide variation in their qualifications and background that makes it so difficult to define precisely in those terms who were the new elite of colonial Africa. One can thus justifiably argue that the issue of the rise of a new elite among any African people in the colonial era was largely a question of what amount and kind of educational and economic opportunities were available to the people and how far they put those opportunities to effective use.

The number of African students in the United States was thereby increased and the time during which Africans as a group were in contact with American blacks was prolonged.

Indications are that industrial or vocational training was welcomed by the colonial entrepreneur since it enabled him to secure well-trained artisans to drive motor lorries, build his houses, and manage his mechanical or electrical plant.

According to his biographer, this pastoral work was 'one of the most important incidents in Aggrey's American experiences', because 'it took him out of an academic atmosphere and introduced him to the activities of the life led by the American Negro'.$^{41}$ Moreover, his connections with black America had already been deepened when he married, in 1904, a young Afro-American woman, possibly a descendant of Frederick Douglass. After twenty-two years work in black America, Aggrey returned to Africa on two separate occasions as a member of the Phelps-Stokes Commission, but died in 1927 shortly after accepting the post of assistant vice-principal of the newly created Achimota College in Ghana.

They also set themselves the task of refuting and disproving racist ideas and practices in a series of articles, pamphlets, books and speeches, and it was this that gave rise to the second of the unique processes of the period, namely, the intellectual revolution and the accompanying birth of African racial consciousness, pan-Africanism and the concept of the African personality. The pioneers of this revolution in West Africa were undoubt› edly James Africanus Horton (1835-83) and Edward Wilmot Blyden (18321912). Among the works of Horton on the themes in question were Political Economy of British Western Africa, with the requirements of the several colonies and settlements: An African view of the Negro place in Nature (1865); West African Countries and Peoples: A Vindication of the African Race (1868); and Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast (1870). In West African Countries and Peoples, Horton refuted the idea of inherent racial inferiority of the black man by arguing that the difference in the stages of civilization between whites and blacks arose 'entirely from the influence of external circumstances'. To those who moved from the assump› tion of racial inferiority of the black to the assumption that he would ultimately disappear from the face of the earth in the face of white power, Horton argued: we find that wherever the African race has been carried to ... they increase, no matter under what depressing and burdensome yoke they may suffer; from which it may be safely inferred that the African people is a permanent and enduring people, and the fancies of those who had determined their destruction will go in the same limbo as the now almost defunct American slavery. 40 Finally, in answer to the proposition that the black was incapable of improvement, he argued: 'Africans are not incapable of improvement, but that by the assistance of good and able men they are destined to figure in the course of time, and to take a prominent part in the history of the civilized world'.$^{41}$ Again in his Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast, Horton wrote in the Preface: Horton not only condemned racism but was also one of the earliest advocates of pan-Africanism.

Indigenous Liberians thus assimilated were regarded as 'civilized' (or 'semi-civilized') by the Americo-Liberians who granted a comparatively few of them political and civil rights on an equal footing with themselves. A few of those thus favoured rose to prominent public or political positions, like Dr Benjamin W. Payne, a Bassa man trained in medicine in the United States, who held a Cabinet position as Secretary of Public Instruction for most of the 1910s and 1920s; Henry Too Wesley, a Grebo man, who was Liberia's Vice-President in the early 1920s; Didwo Twe, a Kru Senator (Plate 28.1); and Momolu Massaquoi, a Vai man, who was at various times in the 1920s Acting Secretary of the Interior and Liberia's Consul in Germany. 7\nNevertheless, even the favoured educated Africans - let alone the mass of unenfranchised and largely oppressed indigenous Liberians - were more or less dissatisfied with 'Americo-Liberian rule' - as they rightly termed the Liberian government. As a rule the educated indigenous Liberians sought to reform Liberia's socio-political system to secure a better deal for the indigenous Liberians. Only rarely, as in 1930, during the forced labour crisis in Liberia, did some of the leading educated indigenous Liberians actively seek to overthrow the Americo-Liberians and supplant them in the government. 8\nAcculturation was, however, not unidirectional. Over the years the Americo-Liberians had themselves adapted many aspects of indigenous Liberian culture which they had earlier abhorred or decried as super› stitious or heathenish, such as belief in the efficacy of magic, witchcraft and 'native medicine'; initiation into the poro; and the practice of pawning persons to meet a debt or other obligation.$^{9}$ The degree of such African› ization was, however, too limited to blur the main social, economic, political and cultural distinctions between the Americo-Liberians as a group, and the indigenous Liberians, by the terminal date of this study in 1935."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Pan-Africanism: political and cultural aspects', 'content': ""Besides these educational exchanges, a series of pan-Africanist organizations and conferences, as well as commercial and literary or cultural activities 47.

Blyden concluded: During all the years which have elapsed since the commencement of modern progress, the African race has filled a very humble and subordinate part in the work of human civilization. But the march of events is developing the interesting fact that there is a career before this people which no other people can enter upon. There is a peculiar work for them to accomplish, both in the land of their bondage, and in the land of their fathers, which no other people can achieve. With the present prospects and privileges before his race - with the chances of arduous work, noble suffering, and magnificent achievement before them - I would rather be a member of this race than a Greek in the time of Alexander, a Roman in the Augustin period, or an AngloSaxon in the nineteenth century. 46 It was also Blyden who in his famous speech to the American Col› onization Society in May 1880 gave great publicity to the phrase 'Ethiopia Stretching Out her Hands Unto God' and equated Ethiopian with African; and it was he who first used the term 'African personality' in his lecture delivered on 19 May 1893 in Freetown when he described the African Race as 'a Great Race - great in its vitality, in its power of endurance and its prospect of perpetuity'. He continued: It is sad to think that there are some Africans, especially among those who have enjoyed the advantages of foreign training, who are so blind to the radical facts of humanity as to say, 'Let us do away with the sentiment of Race. Let us do away with our African personality and be if possible in another Race ... Preach this doctrine as much as you like, no one will do it, for no one can do it, for when you have done away with your personality, you have done away with yourselves ... the duty of every man, of every race is to contend for its individuality to keep and develop it ... Therefore, honour and love your Race ... If you are not yourself, if you surrender your personality, you have nothing left to give to the world .. . 47 Another great leader of the intellectual revolution of the time was undoubtedly that fiery Yoruba-Creole evangelist, James Johnson (c. 18361917).

Washington of South Africa', in a talk in New York City, explicitly affirmed the value for him of Washington's Tuskegee model.

President Barclay of Liberia rejected Azikiwe's application with the curt reminder that he was not a Liberian and, therefore, knew rather less than required about the republic to discharge the duties in question. With characteristic zeal, however, Azikiwe set out to make himself such an authority on Liberia that even the Americo-Liberian citizenry would be envious.

Short of Christianity, no subject is more intimately connected with the welfare of a subject or a protected people than that of their education, and yet there is not one that the Government has so much neglected in its West African settlements. The work of educating the people has been relegated entirely to Christian Missionary Societies. It cannot be that the Government is of opinion that African races are not capable of mental improvement and development, or that they do not need it, and that its government over those entrusted to it should simply be that of a police force for the preservation of order. If this is not its opinion, it is difficult to understand its policy. Whatever may be the ultimate intention for which it holds its settlements on the Coast—whether it be to make them eventually independent and self-governing, or to make them always appendages to the British territory—there is an obligation on its part to furnish them with the means of a liberal education, especially when they are not themselves in a position so to do, so that they may properly discharge their own obligations and answer the end of their existence. They have responsibilities which they cannot discharge without education. These settlements were acquired, and the position held by the Government secured, with the constantly avowed object of thereby aiding to suppress the slave-trade and correct the many untold evils it has inflicted upon Africa, and of making them renovating centres for Western Africa. The object is noble and laudable; but, I ask, what has the Government done to compass this end? What amount of education has it given to the people? For ignorance is as much a hindrance and weakens as education of the right sort is power, and progress. The development of the capabilities of the mind is a power of no little magnitude for developing the resources of a country that is poor and low in the midst of an abundance of the elements of wealth and greatness. The people should be educated to a strong sense of their privileges, duties, and responsibilities. Why is it, then, that the Government has all along neglected this duty, when it stands in loco parenta to these settlements? or has it no faith in the power of education? But for the Missionary Societies, and particularly the Church Missionary Society, which have established themselves in them, these settlements would not have been worth their present value. The efforts made by Government to educate have been very feeble; it has not convinced the people of its earnestness on the subject. I am one of those who think that the funds of Missionary Societies are sacred, and should be employed solely for the work of preaching the Gospel to the heathen. It is for this object they appeal to their friends for support constantly; it is not theirs to establish abroad schools of learning. If educational work is done by them, it should not generally exceed the barely elementary one which would enable converts to read the Scriptures for themselves, and that of raising up native missionaries and pastors to enforce on the people the truths they read. It is all the more necessary that this should be the case, because the area of ground to be covered in heathendom is large, and the funds of great missionary societies have not for many years now shown a large and steady increase. The claims upon them are many and urgent, and in some places there are doors of usefulness open to them already which they are urgently invited to occupy. Now, can they do this with an almost limited income if they must spend a considerable portion of it upon educational work?', 'last_edit_date': '1875-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1875#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""and Lagos, shall become convinced by the introduction of the necessary machinery for such purpose, that it is the desire and determination of the supreme sovereign power, the British Government, to effect their civilization. It has now been sufficiently established that the Africans are receptive, that they are easily taught not only the rudiments of education, but when good masters are found for them, and they are placed under a good system, the higher branches also. We are not, therefore, asking the British Government to take a leap in the dark—to organize educational institutions without absolute knowledge as to whether the people are capable of receiving education. We could point to members of that once despised African race who occupy really an eminent position in law and medicine; and if we have not yet skilled engineers among them, it is only because there have not yet been inducements among them to the cultivation of those sciences whose mighty power is at this time revolutionizing the world. There is every possible encouragement, therefore, to the British Government in entering upon the noble work which we maintain that it is now their duty to undertake and set about in right good earnest. We would have two superior institutions established, one at Lagos and the other at Accra. These settlements and seats of Government are at so little distance from each other, and the facilities for passing from the one to the other are so frequent and so good, that one supreme organizing and superintending educational head would suffice for both.

We need for those West African countries a host of African evangelists and apostles of civilization; we ask that ignorance shall be beaten down by an array of educational power capable of overcoming its inertia, conquering its will, and subduing to itself its sympathies and its love. Oh, 'tis a glorious work to be undertaken, a glorious aim to be accomplished—a work and an aim worthy of a Government that has taken seriously in hand the deliverance of South-eastern Europe from the paralyzing influences of a rule under which every noble aspiration has been strangled, and the commonest principles of humanity have been outraged and trampled under foot. And we cannot conceive on what ground such a work can be any longer neglected and delayed. That the whole civilized world, and more especially Great Britain and the other European countries, have the deepest possible interest in the civilization of Africa, and that development of her wondrous resources which can only take place through the diffusion of civilization, is beyond all doubt; and since West Africa herself, under the organizing and administrative help of Great Britain, can be made to furnish the means, we earnestly exhort the Secretary of State for the Colonies to plant there without delay that tree of knowledge which alone can effect it. It is only thus that the prophecies of a Buxton and a Palmerston can be fulfilled; and Africa become the glory, instead of the reproach and disgrace, of the Christian civilized world."", 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I consider that, as far as may be expected of Missionary Societies, they have been liberal in their efforts to educate the people in some parts of the Coast, and particularly in Sierra Leone, where, besides the Missionary Colleges of the Church Missionary Society and the Wesleyan Missionary Society, the former has had a public Grammar School since 1845, and a Female Institution which is nearly as old, if not older, and training masters from England. The Government is indebted to them for the measure of educated native intelligence which it brings into requisition in its service. These Societies have shown that Africans are capable of any degree of improvement, and created a thirst for learning which the people are now anxious to have satisfied.\n\nI am not aware that their general educational work was subsidized by Government all the while they were at it; and it was hardly to be expected that the people themselves, mostly poor liberated slaves, could have contributed much for its support. The Government holds a position on the Gold Coast; this position is enhanced, and its responsibility increased, by the Act which has recently liberated hundreds of thousands of slaves from bondage, or at least placed them on the way to claim their freedom. Untold blessings to the Coast and the interior of Africa will, I expect, result from it if the efforts to discharge duties and responsibilities are of the right kind, and are properly directed. It is the duty, and will be to the honour of the Government to seek to liberate from slavery the minds of those whose bodies only have been made free. They are yet the slaves of ignorance, superstition, and folly, and can and will do no credit either to themselves or to the Power that has given them the status of freed men if they are left to continue uneducated; nor will they be ever qualified for a proper and wholesome use of the position they enjoy, and the power placed in their hands; and by how much the mind is superior to the body, by so much is the slavery of the mind worse than that of the body. Besides these freed slaves, there is a very large originally free but poor population, who cannot provide schools for their children. The establishment of elementary schools over the whole Protectorate, and the power to read and write in their own language and in others acquired by the people, would be the beginning of their greatness.', 'last_edit_date': '1875-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1875#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.721, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When writing last month on the all-important subject of the future spread of Christian civilization in West Africa, we pointed out that educated natives, more or less under the influence of Christian faith, more or less imbued with Christian principles, more or less governed by Christian precepts, are and will be indispensable as a vanguard of the great army of civilization that must be projected upon the ignorant barbarism of heathen Africa whenever the means for such projection shall be arranged. We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.739, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Too much praise cannot be given you for your unwearied and long-continued efforts on behalf of poor Africa and her unfortunate sons.

If, as stated in my previous correspondence, such a school as the High-class School be amply and efficiently supported, it will prove a great boon to the place. That the educational work that is thus being inaugurated here needs such support as you have pleaded for will be evident from the fact that it has not been undertaken by the Church Missionary Society, as your remarks would seem to indicate, but by the sole efforts of some of the native residents of this place, who, sensible of the great educational wants of the community, have requested the Bishop of Sierra Leone to aid them in the establishment here of the Church of England with a properly-organized school; and the kind-hearted prelate, ever ready to lend a helping hand to every very good work, promised to aid their efforts in the undertaking. From this it will be seen that such needful help as you have advocated is a *sine qua non* in the proper development of education in this place; and should it be afforded, an efficient staff of competent teachers will be secured, and high-class schools, grammar schools, collegiate schools, and other seminaries of learning will be established along this Coast, which will undoubtedly be productive of unspeakable benefit to the country at large. This, Mr. Editor, in my humble opinion, will be the only panacea for the effectual eradication of the moral, social, and intellectual evil under which ""the land is groaning.""\n\nThe hope of this country\'s elevation seems to me to be in the rising and future generations, in the proper development of their intellectual faculties, and the instilment into their minds of the ""sweets"" of education.

Even ""leaps and bounds"" does not adequately represent the rate of progress, which can only be measured by the pace of the steam engine. That too, will presently be distanced by the onward move of events which has already brought West Africa to the threshold of such an advanced outpost of civilisation as technical education. This is a sign of progress the more remarkable when it is remembered that at a not very remote period the principal instruments of civilisation in Africa were reputed to be rum and gunpowder. But the schoolmaster, chiefly through the medium of the missionary societies, has long been abroad in Africa. Light on the subject is derived from The Lagos Weekly Record, which recently, in commenting on the possibilities of the Yoruba country, as indicated in the Governor\'s report, remarked that ""The time was at hand when the civilised Natives, now appearing to flourish in the settlement, will demand outlets for their energies, and new sources of livelihood; when in order to succeed, or even to live, they will be obliged to join the great army of aboriginal producers, or ally themselves to the foreign consumers, or be crushed between the two.""\n\nThe necessities thus summarised are recognised both by the Government and by the missionary societies, and the former is devising the establishment of an institution for training youths in various handicrafts. At present, it is stated, the whole of the coast is dependent for mechanics upon the protégés of the Basel Mission and repatriates from the Brazils. The extension of the work of technical education is encouraged by the success that has attended the efforts of the Basel missionaries, thanks to whom ""the Gold Coast is now the principal source whence good coopers, carpenters, blacksmiths, and wheelwrights can be obtained, and the skilled mechanics of Accra are in great demand all over the West Coast from Sierra Leone to the Congo."" The fact that there is scope in the Colony, as well as at other points along the West Coast, for almost any number of skilled mechanics, certainly favours the enterprise now under the consideration of the Government, and this scope for technical skill cannot fail to be greatly broadened as the interior is increasingly opened up. The practical steps which are being taken in the direction of equipping African youths in the most modern of civilised fashions for the struggle for existence on their own soil may be briefly summed up. The Bishop of Sierra Leone, assisted by Canon Taylor Smith, will, during their present visit to England, make an effort to raise £2,000 for the erection at Freetown of a technical school for the education of young Africans: whilst Captain Denton, during his residence in England on leave, will give attention to the details of the proposed Government scheme.', 'last_edit_date': '1894-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1894#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Superior General Education at Sierra Leone by the Church Missionary Society', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Sir,—At last there will be a college for general education in Western Africa, under the auspices of the invaluable Church Missionary Society.

The other plan (abstract teaching, divorced from material business) has been abundantly tried, and what is the result? Not only does the constant hammering at the brain, of which this raw (negro) youth must now become a victim, produce an unbalanced development, but the precocious memory that will characterise him is a deceptive gauge of progress made, and, like much precociousness elsewhere, the results are disappointing in after life. For this reason, a successfully-passed examination on paper is not the test in Africa that it is in England. ... Can we be surprised that the very last thing he (the negro young man) thinks of is the development of his country or making his father\'s village better than he found it—and thus his want of accuracy, want of perseverance and skill, and all that goes to make a man master of any situation, remain uncorrected, and put him altogether out of the running.

The lecturer said: The future of South Africa was much bound up with this question of administration, and especially the educational part of it. A proper education meant an assimilation of the coloured man to the ideal of the white man, with regard to habits of mind and of thought. The question of education was visibly affected by political disturbances. With regard to the general question, which was viewed in many different ways by white people both in the colony and at home, he said the great desideratum of the hour in South Africa was to raise the discussion of important matters beyond the atmosphere of party. Nothing had so much injured the native as the custom of using him for the purpose of a party cry. Premising that he should confine himself principally to the state of affairs in the Cape Colony, the Lecturer said he should show that there had existed and did still exist in that colony a State scheme for the instruction of the natives in nearly everything they might require to know, whether it was to shoe a horse, make a wheel, or learn Greek. As he had himself endeavoured to instruct the Caffre in the Greek declensions, in his capacity as Government Lecturer in the colony, he might say that the loftiness and catholicity of the scheme had come home to him. Remarking upon the difficulties in the way of applying such a scheme in a sparsely-peopled savage country like South Africa, he said the number of white colonists at the Cape was about equal to the population of Leeds, and these had to legislate for the reclamation of more than a million blacks, who were scattered over an immense tract. Other difficulties lay in the unequal social developments among the black people, in the bi-lingual character of the white population, and in the want of unanimity on the part of the white colonists as to the proper lines upon which native education ought to go. To bring under one system of State education men of different religious views, hard though it might be, was an easy task for the political legislator compared with that encountered in an attempt to group under one plan men so intellectually and, if he might use the term, spiritually distinct as the European and the African aboriginal races. The difference between the races was, practically speaking, one absolutely of kind, not of degree. Undeterred by difficulties, legislators at the Cape had boldly grappled with the question, and they had established a complete educational ladder, with the kraal schools at the bottom and the university at the top. After going with some detail into the working of the scheme in that colony, and suggesting some possible improvements in the system, he remarked that though philanthropy in theory, in practice it was unphilosophic. A cardinal fact was ignored—the generic difference between the European and the Caffre. The principle of heredity was ignored. He was inclined to believe that the Caffre would be influenced by a simple and rather an autocratic system. Advocating a certain measure of compulsion in order to make the Caffre industrious, and to compel him to be taught, he said the educationist should walk hand in hand with the white magistrate and the missionary; these three classes of men really replace the autocracy of the chiefs. He thought that if the philanthropist could be persuaded to believe that all men were not equal, and if the Boer could be persuaded to believe that they might be equal in course of time—in fact, that there was a germ which might be worked upon in the native, there would be some chance of an agreement. If both philanthropist and Boer should take the scientific view that the Caffre was really nothing more than he was by descent, a savage pure and simple, but that he had in him the makings of a good citizen, there would be considerably less friction in South Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1884#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.712, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""MRS.

However, it also points out the alienation of African soldiers from their societies and their exclusion from command positions, suggesting limited agency in shaping military affairs.

In contrast, The African Times articles provide details supporting the claim, highlighting the Anamaboe Volunteer Rifles as a unit composed of educated Africans with officers from principal merchants and residents, reflecting both colonial influence and African agency. The articles emphasize the involvement of local chiefs and educated Africans in military and ceremonial events, and the recruitment of African troops for British-led expeditions, such as the Bonny men in the Ashanti War. They also highlight the blending of local customs with colonial practices and the agency of African leaders, like King George Pepple, in negotiating and contributing to military efforts, indicating a degree of autonomy and influence.

This reflects the influence of colonial powers on local military practices, as seen in the claim. However, the text also notes that African soldiers were often alienated from their own societies and denied command positions, which limited their agency in shaping military affairs. The claim suggests a level of agency among African leaders in participating and shaping colonial military affairs, which is not strongly supported by the textbook's emphasis on the European control and manipulation of African military roles.

Additionally, the articles mention the recruitment of African troops for British-led expeditions, such as the contingent of Bonny men sent to the Ashanti War, further illustrating the integration of Africans into colonial military structures. The presence of native bands and the participation of African leaders in military reviews and ceremonies highlight the blending of local customs with colonial military practices. However, the articles also emphasize the agency of African leaders, such as King George Pepple, in negotiating and contributing to these military efforts, indicating a degree of autonomy and influence in shaping these interactions.

By then domination had shifted from military to civil institutional control while direct force tended to be replaced by administrative persuasion. This shift, however, in no way denied the fact that the ultima ratio of colonial authority was displayed by European arms.\nAs its most ardent advocates were willing to remark, colonial rule was won by the sword and so maintained. With this dictum in mind, all the European powers utilized in their military establishments elements recruited from the indigenous population. Although organization and effectiveness varied both according to region and particular national purposes, such colonial troops primarily performed police functions in the inter-war era and were joined by newly created constabulary forces in this capacity. Yet because they were frequently made to serve in geographical regions culturally and ethnically unfamiliar to them, African soldiers were thus alienated from their own society and were often received with hostility by the local populations they forcefully encountered. As a result of this condition and, furthermore, of the European denial of command positions to Africans, the army never came to play the political role in the independence movements that its counterparts in Asia and the Near East did. In fact, the only colonial power which elaborated a significant military policy for the Africans under its domination was France which, from the first years of the twentieth century, considered sub-Saharan Africa a man› power reservoir essential to the maintenance of the French military posture in the world.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""A product of colonialism and one which is often ignored by most historians, but which has turned out to be of crucial and fundamental importance, was, as is evident from R.

In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W. Gutteridge has admitted, the armed forces have 'operated in the longer term against the stability of the ex-colonies'.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""Another important but negative political impact of colonialism was the weakening of the indigenous systems of government.

Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence.

Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty. To them, there could be no compromise on that, and indeed many of the leaders of these states chose to die on the battlefield, go into voluntary flight or face exile rather than surrender their sovereignty without a struggle.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The legacy of wars', 'content': ""As noted above, the critical factor in the changing balance of power in Africa in the 1870s was not the troops, nor their training and discipline or generalship, but the quality and quantity of the guns available to the respective sides. The ultimate answer in the contest for power in Africa therefore depended on the monopolization of arms and ammunition. This was not easy to achieve as long as Europeans pursued national interests and African rulers could play off one power against another. Moreover, in the essential search for allies, Europeans had to use the supply of quality guns to bargain for treaties, concessions, neutrality or active participation in wars against rival African states. It therefore became essential to regulate their Scramble on the basis of international agreements and, in particular, to limit the supply of arms and ammunition. The most intense rivalry was between the British and the French. The British tried to secure their interests by also playing the role of protectors of Portuguese interests. This gave Bismarck the opportunity to play the role of an interested broker by convening an International Conference in Berlin. This Conference in turn gave King Leopold his chance to seek for international support for his ambitions on the Congo by proclaiming free trade and humanitarian antislavery ambitions.$^{24}$ This prepared the way for the Brussels Act which banned the supply of arms to African rulers in the name of an anti-slavery campaign.\nThe truth was that by linking the limitation of arms with the anti-slavery campaign, the British were able to exempt the 'self-governing' settlers in South Africa from the operations of the Brussels Act. By this device also, while constantly fighting African states and negotiating various treaties and conventions with African rulers, they could pretend that, by owning slaves and dealing in slaves, African states enjoyed no recognition in international law.

It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey.

In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press.

The colonial partition and conquest definitely resulted, as A. E. Afigbo has pointed out above (Chapter 19), in a revolutionary reshaping of the political face of Africa. In place of the hundreds of independent clan and lineage groups, city-states, king› doms and empires, without any clearly marked boundaries, were now established fifty new states with, in most cases, fixed boundaries, and it is rather significant that the boundaries of the states as laid down during the colonial era have not undergone any changes since independence.\nThirdly, the colonial system also introduced into most parts of Africa two new institutions which again rather significantly have been maintained since independence, namely, a new judicial system and a new bureaucracy or civil service. There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years. The importance of this particular legacy varied from one colonial system to the other. There is no doubt that the British bequeathed a better trained, numerically larger and more experienced bureaucracy to her colonies than the French, while the record of the Belgians and the Portuguese is the worst in this respect.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Conclusions', 'content': ""What were the effects of colonial African and American black interaction? Only African populations of certain regions were initially involved in inter› action with American and Caribbean blacks. Those regions involved early in our period were the ones which became the focus of American black emigration or evangelism, particularly West Africa, South Africa, and the Horn. Peoples of other regions became involved because of the penetration of their region by pan-Africanist projects, American black writings, folk› lore, and the like, or more importantly, because of the initiatives of school leavers who went, in growing numbers from all over the African continent, to America for higher education.\nPerspectives were undoubtedly affected by direct and substantial inter› action of Africans within a particular black environment or set of influences. Exactly how much is anybody's guess. The effect of colonial African experience with American blacks appears, nevertheless, unique and vital in terms of subsequent social and political activities. For some, the American black component within African nationalist ideology and strategies emerging during the colonial period was striking and unequivocal. In the view of others, for example some African students, interactions within American black arenas were disappointing and unrewarding. The caustic assessment of one such visitor illustrates the latter point: 'One of the things I had decided to find out during my stay in America was the condition of the descendants of former slaves brought here from Africa ... I feel safe in saying that, so far as economic and material progress are concerned the Negro in America is on the average ahead of the West African, but when it comes to integrity and genuine manhood, the American Negro is far below him.' 75 Another view was that many Afro-American missionaries who viewed Africans as 'poor heathen savages' must bear some of the responsibility for perpetuating a distorted and pernicious picture of Africa and Africans in the minds of their fellow American blacks. In other words, in their sedulous campaign to recruit American black workers for foreign missions, missionary churches undoubtedly succumbed occasionally to the tempta- tion of portraying an exotic, erotic and socially inferior Africa much in need of great sacrifice, hard work, and alien redemption."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 135, 'article_title': 'Anamaboe: Reception of Governor Pine', 'full_section_title': 'Anamaboe: Reception of Governor Pine', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1863#article-14', 'issue_date': '23_03_1863', 'content': 'After the interview was over, the whole of the assembled force again fired a general salute, and then the King and chiefs retired, their men firing as they withdrew. It was altogether a splendid sight, and very interesting, even to those who were not entire strangers to such scenes. The immense crowd of spectators, all of whom were dressed in their holiday attire, added greatly to the effect. The number of young men and women dressed in European style astonished even the old residents. There was a very large sprinkling of young females expensively got up in native attire. Although there were three or four professors of the art of photography on the spot, yet it is a pity that not one of them availed himself of such a favourable occasion to take a group of African fair ones, so that their likenesses might have been enclosed herewith, in order that you kind people in England might see how shamefully some of your would-be artists misrepresent African females in features, dress, and everything else. After the termination of this African review, which passed off without the slightest accident, and at which the Governor expressed himself highly pleased, his Excellency and suite returned to the fort. In the evening a sumptuous banquet was given to his Excellency in the grand hall of the fort, by the Commandant and the principal residents of Anamaboe. Covers were laid for fifty guests. The King and three of his principal chiefs were invited, as also several gentlemen from Cape Coast and Anamaboe. The officers of the Anamaboe Volunteer Rifles were also present in full uniform. The viands and wines were of the most _recherché_ description. After the usual loyal toasts, the health of his Excellency was proposed and responded to with that hearty goodwill which testifies to the respect that the Africans of the Gold Coast still entertain towards the representative of Her Majesty the Queen of England, in spite of the severe shocks which they have experienced on perceiving that their confidence in, and respect for, some of their late rulers were so woefully misplaced. A native band enlivened the festivity by performing some popular native airs on native instruments, late in the evening—the first time, I believe, that the services of a _bona fide_ native band had ever been called into requisition on such an occasion. On the 4th, at noon, his Excellency proceeded in an open carriage to the Fort-gate, whence a procession set out for the site appointed for the erection of the new market, in the following order: A carriage containing his Excellency and suite; a detachment of the Gold Coast Artillery; a detachment of the Anamaboe Volunteer Rifles; merchants and other residents of Anamaboe; the members of the Anamaboe Temperance Society, under their president and founder, R. J. Ghartey; the boys and girls of the Wesleyan Mission School, preceded by the Rev. Timothy Laing, native minister. On arriving at the site, his Excellency was met by the King and chiefs with their staff, who had formed a most brilliant procession from another quarter of the town. A silver trowel was presented to his Excellency by Commandant Thomson, and after the usual observances, not forgetting the new coins, his Excellency proceeded to lay the foundation-stone; which done, he delivered a brief but most appropriate speech. The school-children then sang ""God save the Queen,"" and their performance so delighted the Governor, that he caused them to repeat the anthem, at the conclusion of which three cheers were given, and the procession returned in the same order that it had arrived. The weather was most propitious during the whole of the time. During the day many chiefs from different parts of the country in the commandantship of Anamaboe came into town with their retainers and fired salutes and reviewed their men, in honour of the Governor. The proceedings of this day were brought to a fitting conclusion by a _grand \'relish,\'_ or, as you would term it, a _déjeuner à la fourchette,_ in the fort, and the performance of the numerous guests on the occasion bore ample testimony to the fact that they did not come there for mere pastime. His Excellency and suite returned to Cape Coast Castle early on the ensuing morning. With the exception of the Governor, Major Cochrane, Lieutenant Thomson, and Mr. Brown, of Cape Coast, all those who assisted in the ceremonies of these two days were natives of Africa, including some hundreds of educated men. His Excellency expressed himself highly gratified with the brilliant reception given him by the loyal people of Anamaboe, and was particularly struck with the appearance of the Anamaboe Volunteer Rifles.

In the midst of the armed men were seen here and there the large umbrellas of the different Cabboceers and chiefs. These umbrellas might be called tents almost, for some of them are large enough to afford shelter to ten or fifteen men. They are made of silk and satin of the most gorgeous colours and the most expensive description, and on the top of each there is an ornament in either gold, silver, or wood, which is, literally, the crest of the owner. The numerous flags of the different companies added greatly to the effect. These flags, all of which had the Union Jack in the corner, were made some of silk and some of ordinary bunting, and had devices, something similar to those which ornamented the tops of the Cabboceers' umbrellas, worked in them. It is these devices in flags and figures on the umbrellas which have so often caused jealousies, leading to the shedding of blood; but such events rarely occur now, for the people are getting more enlightened. The whole of the force being now assembled, they fired a grand salute, which lasted nearly one hour, after which the King and chiefs alighted from their baskets and ascended to the verandah, where they were introduced to, and had a long interview with, his Excellency. The King and all his chiefs were arrayed most gorgeously in silk togas, and were preceded by all the insignia of their respective offices—two-edged swords with gold and silver handles, gold and silver sticks and messengers' canes, elephants' tails mounted in the same precious metals, and musical instruments of African manufacture, rude, but by no means so unpleasant as might be supposed. The King and some of the principal chiefs, one of them the uncle of a member of the Legislative Council of these settlements, were literally groaning under the weight of the gold ornaments, manufactured and rough, with which they were covered. Their attendants were also attired in most superb habiliments. Their guards, though not exactly habited as troops are in civilised countries, were yet, in dress, very far removed from that state in which some ungenerous persons from more civilised lands delight to depict them. These men presented a most creditable appearance, which went far to prove that the natives of the Gold Coast are not the least advanced amongst the sons of Africa in civilization.

It is proposed to reconstruct the dilapidated forts in all the settlements, and to erect fresh fortifications where they may be needed; and, besides this, it is in contemplation to increase the number of troops in Africa by the amalgamation of two or more regiments into one. Public attention being directed to the subject of defences, the importance of reorganizing the Militia which existed some years ago has been mooted by the local Press. In the first place, a Militia in the colony could be utilized in the event of any sudden outbreak in Africa requiring a large number of troops for an expedition or as a reserve force. It would also serve to protect the settlement from any hostile attack that might be directed against it. In the second place, its organization would preclude the necessity of augmenting the number of Regular troops to be stationed in Africa. The scheme for protection has been sufficiently matured to come into operation. The people of the Gold Coast have simultaneously applied for permission to establish a Rifle Corps as a Volunteer force for the protection of the colony—an organization similar in its details to the English Militia, and one whose importance has been recognized by Sir Garnet Wolseley.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We reproduce elsewhere two important papers relating to West Africa. One is a survey of the Oil Rivers Protectorate, furnished by an evidently well-informed correspondent of the London *Times*, on the occasion of Major McDonald and his staff sailing to inaugurate the new administration over 350 miles of seaboard and a large but undefined region inland. The other document is the Report of the Annual Meeting of the Royal Niger Company, describing the progress of settlement in their Niger territories. It is estimated that no less than half-a-million square miles are covered by their treaties or reserved to their influence by international arrangements. Both of these documents are interesting reading, as they speak hopefully and with justifiable confidence of development and progress. It may not be amiss to point out that, owing to the relative positions of these two British possessions, and the long frontier line which they have in common, the future of both largely depends on their administrators working together harmoniously for the common good. There is every reason to believe that this harmony will be maintained. Major McDonald has given many solid proofs of his capacity and tact; while the Niger Company have not only shown great administrative ability, but have successfully lived down the violent and, as it proves, unjustified attacks which were at one time made upon their policy and conduct. Major McDonald has a fine field open to him in the Oil Rivers Protectorate, which possesses a valuable and long-established trade, and can, therefore, with moderate taxation, yield a sufficient revenue for administration and development. We venture to hope that he will follow the example of the Niger Company in one particular—by largely using coloured agents in dealing with the native tribes. It is well known that some of the most useful work of the Company has been done by their numerous coloured officials. These have, when opportunity offered, ...\n\nproved the capacity of their race, and amply justified the statemanlike policy of the Company in setting aside the absurd prejudices which have elsewhere hampered progress and civilisation.

There is a Roman Catholic church, and a small conventual establishment in connexion with it; the Wesleyans have a chapel at Bathurst and another at McCarthy's Island. An allowance of 100l. per annum is made to the Wesleyan Mission, and the same to the Roman Catholic, in aid of general education, and a further grant of 30l. to each for charitable purposes.

The inland limits of the Gold Coast colony are vague, and variable in extent.

Beyond the Volta and the countries of Gyaman, Ashanti, and Brono, the inhabitants are mainly Mahommedans, and belong to a stock related to the Mandingos, although there is a large infusion of immigrant Hausa traders and fighting men. In some of these lands a proportion of the Hausa constabulary of the Gold Coast is recruited. Although the inhabitants of the Gold Coast belong almost entirely to what may be called the Ashanti family, yet increasingly the Hausa language is becoming the commercial tongue of the natives, although English has a great hold and is extending. The influence of the Hausa, no doubt, is aided by the presence of the constabulary, who are either recruited on the Niger or at the back of the Gold Coast.

In former times sufficient attention was not always given by the authorities to the suitability of candidates for employment in the minor posts in these then much despised West African possessions. But all this has greatly changed. The growing importance of the West African trade, and the general éclaircissement which followed the operations of the Ashanti War, have brought about a different spirit in the administration of these colonies, and the present colonial service in West Africa is not inferior to any other branch of the service in other parts of the world, and of late has furnished a considerable proportion of remarkable men who have distinguished themselves on the West Coast of Africa, and have been raised to posts of great influence and distinction elsewhere. I think, however, that decidedly more might be done to encourage such work as I have referred to in Lagos, namely, a thorough and scientific examination of the natural history and ethnology of these lands, so that we can be better guided in our administration of them, both by increasing our knowledge of their natural resources and by becoming more acquainted with the character of the races whom we are to rule. Especially should the learning of native languages be fostered among colonial officers. This movement has been already begun on the Gold Coast by Sir Brandford Griffith, and in Lagos by Captain Moloney, but I do not think any official steps have been taken in the matter. In nearly all the great divisions of Africa there is some lingua Franca—some widespread language of general use among native traders, or the ruling caste, which would be understood everywhere, from Benin to Old Calabar, and up the Niger to its confluence with the Benue; the Yoruba tongue, which is prevalent throughout Logos colony and right away to the kingdom of Nupe; the Hausa language, which is a good deal spoken in the Gold Coast colony, and which is one of the leading tongues of the Niger basin; the Mandingo, which is widely spread as a commercial language over the Sierra Leone colony; and the Wolof, which is much spoken on the Gambia. In the learning of each one of these languages in their respective spheres of influence colonial officers should be encouraged by small bounties or some palpable reward.

The best district was that of Benin, which was in charge of Captain Gallwey, of the East Lancashire Regiment. In a very able despatch forwarded by that officer, it was pointed out that the trade in this district for the past year was not satisfactory. The reasons were—first, the predominating influence of the great middleman chief Nana, who had had for many years past a monopoly of the trade, and who is jealous of any interference; second, the continued petty quarrels that occurred between the middlemen and the oil producers; third, the fetish rule of the King of Benin, who had placed religious prohibition on certain articles of trade, which prohibition was only removed by paying a heavy tax to the King; fourth, the inability of the natives to understand the varying price of products in the home markets. These obstacles to an increase of trade were being most ably and successfully dealt with by Captain Gallwey, an officer whose energy and tact in dealing with the natives was beyond all praise. Captain Gallwey had recently effected a treaty with the King of Benin, a potentate who hitherto refused all efforts in this direction. As to the districts of Brass and Warree, which marched with the Niger territories on the east and west, the chiefs of Brass were a difficult factor to deal with; they had many grievances, some real and some imaginary. Captain MacDonald, in charge of this district, had had a troublesome task to perform in dealing with them—a task he had carried out with much tact and skill. (Cheers.) A force of Mohammedan troops, 250 in number, had been raised—fully armed, drilled, and equipped—while barracks had been provided for them at Old Calabar. Fresh enlistments were taking place, but the supply of recruits was limited, owing to the demand for men in the West African colonies from whose territories the recruits were enlisted. The general plan, which was based on lines laid down in the Brussels Act, was to establish fortified posts at certain distances in the interior, to form between them lateral communications by means of roads well kept and guarded, and then to advance another parallel, leaving nothing unfinished or unguarded behind, and by such means to bring the whole of the ground covered under the influence of civilisation and Christianity. (Loud cheers.) But that was not so easy a task. By far the greater part of the native population were steeped in practices which were abhorrent. He alluded to human sacrifice, cannibalism, the slaughter of twins, and slave-raiding, with all its attendant horrors. To do away with these without setting the country in a blaze would require time, immense patience, and an intimate knowledge of the native character. Above all things with the African natives, they should be just; they should say what they were going to do and do it. (Cheers.) They should be gentle, but just and firm, and, above all, let the native feel that if he did wrong there was an iron hand of justice, backed by the law and power of England, but tempered by its mercy, from which in the long run there was no escape.

When he ascended the throne in 1894, he seemed to be suspicious of Europeans, mostly missionaries at that time, so he sought to restrict his people's interactions with them. Those among the Baganda who had embraced the Christian faith and who would not obey his orders were put to death as traitors.$^{29}$ Today, Christians regard them as martyrs. Mwanga was, however, violently resisting attempts by British agents to take over his country even though disguised as mission› aries. But his diplomatic ability also became apparent in the way he handled various, often warring religious sects. At one time, he would play the two Christian sects, Catholics and Protestants, against Muslims when he thought the latter were becoming too powerful and therefore threatening his control of the country. At another time, he would ally with Muslims against Catholics or Protestants or both depending on who he thought was dangerous to his rule. Thus, Mwanga was adept at the diplomatic game of divide and rule, a tactic which the colonizing powers were able to use so effectively in controlling Africa. When it was necessary, Mwanga resorted to a revival of some old tradition in an attempt to drive out all foreigners as happened in 1888.$^{30}$ On this occasion, he intended to entice all foreigners and their Baganda followers to a naval parade on an island on Lake Victoria. There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler. Later, however, in 1889, Mwanga managed to regain his throne only to be exiled to Kisimayu, as already indicated, in 1899, where he died in 1903."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The legacy of wars', 'content': 'In other words, while European powers were dealing with individual African states, recognizing them, befriending some and fighting others in Africa, in Europe they closed ranks along racial lines and formed a cartel to regulate the flow of essential arms to the Africans. African leaders had no answer to this strategy. The competition for power in Africa had been drawn into the international politics of the Concert of Europe where African diplomatic skills were at a grave disadvantage. It is doubtful whether African leaders realized until too late how great was the danger that threatened them. They were used to thinking that the European base was far away and that, in the final analysis, they had the advantage of numbers.\nThey continued to act as if they could play off one European power against another. In South Africa, they even believed that they could appeal to the Queen of England and her direct representatives to carry out treaty obligations against the wishes of Anglo-Boer settlers and fortune seekers. Far from any notion of forging a pan-African solidarity similar to that pursued by the Europeans, each African state acted as seemed best in its own individual interest.\nIt appears that, if any factor is to be singled out, the basic explanation for this was to be found not only in the diplomatic abilities of the European strategists, but also in the legacy of wars that was part of the revolutionary situation of nineteenth-century Africa.

Those African rulers who have been mistakenly termed collaborators were those who thought that the best way of safeguarding their sovereignty or even regaining the sovereignty that they might have lost to some African power previous to the arrival of the Europeans was not to collaborate but rather to ally with the European invaders. A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation.

By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'Among the social effects of foreign rule on African society, the most immediately noticeable was the political one. Pre-existing African states, except for Liberia and, up to 1935, Ethiopia, lost most of their sovereignty and with it the right to participate in the affairs of the world community except indirectly through their new masters. Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

The Akamba in Kenya and the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika were involved in the caravan trade from the interior to the coast - a phenomenon often referred to as long-distance trade.$^{5}$ The Baganda as well as the Wanga in Kenya had also had contact with Arabs trading in ivory and slaves prior to the 1890s. Again the degree of exposure to these outside influences determined the type and extent of resistance put up by various societies.\nApart from these human influences, there were ecological changes taking place in East Africa in the 1890s, which also affected response to foreign penetration. The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all. A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya.

When King Leopold called an international conference in Brussels in 1876 'to discuss methods of peaceful and co- operative action to develop legitimate commerce and attack the slave trade',$^{62}$ the rivalry was already appearing on the surface. The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo. The most significant action of the period was the British occupation of Egypt in 1882. For the British the action was justified because of the strategic position of Egypt (with the Suez Canal and the Nile) for British interests in India and East Africa, although East Africa was considered of less importance. But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year. In West Africa Germany and France were beginning to stand together to challenge the British position on the Niger. The 'high tide of imperialism' had begun to flow. When Bismark convened the Berlin Conference in November 1884, the process of partitioning Africa had already started. In East Africa Carl Peters had already arrived in Zanzibar under the auspices of his Gesellschaft für Deutsche Kolonisation (German Colonization Society) and had gone inland to negotiate treaties.

The grand lesson of the slave trade era long driven home in West and Central Africa, and being learnt in East Africa in the course of the nineteenth century, was that the way to survive and perhaps even profit from the slave trade was to strengthen the structures and military basis of state power.\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, as we have noted in most parts of Africa, 'the political and economic structures ... seemed to have a certain fragility about them. There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority. In the words of K. Arhin and J. Ki-Zerbo describing the Voltaic regions: During the nineteenth century, political instability and population movements were widespread. Brutal massacres and secessionist move› ments were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority... Some notable exceptions notwithstanding, the frequency and extent of these conflicts grew and the tendency towards social dislocation was undoubtedly linked with the growing opportunities available to the peripheral powers and the rebels to obtain arms and use them to challenge the reigning chiefs. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Political structures', 'content': ""Notable examples of this tendency were the initial impact of the Mfecane, and the impact of trade and the Chokwe and Ovimbundu expansion on the Luba and Lunda state systems.$^{4}$ Several states and empires disappeared.

The search for more stable political structures had been going on throughout the nineteenth century and indeed before then as part of the general evolution of the peoples. Perhaps there was a quickening of the pace, and changes hitherto associated with the rise of states like Old Oyo in the seventeenth century or Asante, Dahomey, Futa Jallon, Futa Toro and Bondu in the eighteenth century became more general in the nineteenth century.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo* Basin and Angola', 'section_title': 'Adventurers, traders, condottieri: the new masters', 'content': 'The power of the bulopwe is one of the most ancient and illustrious in the history of the savanna peoples. Elsewhere in the region in the nineteenth century, we see the title of chief being assumed, with great frequency and new forms of power appearing. Either the role of chief had become obsolete (as in certain Kongo or Mbundu groups), or the expansion of trade had led to polarization around enterprising groups or individuals. Examples of this process can be found throughout Central Africa, both in societies with and without chiefs. In the rain-forest of the Central Basin, for example, certain traders succeeded in accumulating slaves, arms, copper, etc. For the most part, they were canoe-traders living on the banks of the Zaire river, who had grown rich by the slave trade. Indeed the history of the kingdom of Msiri begins with a series of trading expeditions.\nTowards the middle of the nineteenth century, Sumbwa travellers from what is now Tanzania came to trade with the chiefs of the Lunda, Luba, Aushi, etc. of the Luapula valley and surrounding country. These traders were attracted by ivory, abundant in the region, and copper, worked in the west of the kingdom of Kazembe. In about 1885, Ngelengwa Mwenda, the son of one of these travellers, who had accompanied his father on his expeditions, settled in the territory of chief Katanga, a major centre of copper production, densely populated for that part of the world.$^{23}$ During this period Arab, Swahili, Nyamweze and Ovimbundu trading expeditions visited the region in great numbers, seeking to expand their trade in copper, ivory and slaves.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading.

In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

The first was the new interest which the Duke of Brabant, crowned a constitutional king (Leopold I) of the Belgians in 1865, proclaimed in Africa. This was signified by the so-called Brussels Geographical Conference which he convened in 1876 and which resulted in the setting up of the African International Association and the employment of H. M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

After five and a-half hours\' steaming, a small harbour on the south shore of the island of Ukerewe was reached, and here the boat anchored for the night. Next morning a further four and a-half hours\' run brought her to a small island, where a stay was made to load up firewood. Starting again on the Monday morning, the boat steamed steadily due north the whole day, those on board hoping to sight before sunset an island which had been discovered by the late Mr. Mackay, of Uganda. In this they were disappointed, however, and next day sail was set, to economise the use of fuel. On Wednesday morning the island of Sesse was sighted, and here fuel in abundance was obtained; and after a good run, an anchorage was found at an island named Bukasi, north of Sesse, at 4 p.m. Leaving there at 4 a.m. on Dec. 24, the Ruwenzori arrived safely at Port Alice at 11 a.m. the same day. Of course, this run across the Lake took much longer than will be the case in future voyages; but, in the absence of charts, it was a matter of ""feeling their way across."" The arrival of the first steamer in Uganda was a matter of great interest to its residents, both European and Native. A trial trip was run from Port Alice, when several of the Europeans and all the Native chiefs were on board. King Mwanga was also to have been present, but was unable to come, having injured himself by a fall whilst riding the previous day. All on board expressed themselves highly pleased with the trip. Later news—viz., from Port Victoria, dated Jan. 8, reports the arrival of the Ruwenzori at that port on the 7th, after an exciting voyage: a heavy thunderstorm, with rain at first, and afterwards hailstones as large as walnuts, having been experienced en route. The Ruwenzori brought the mail runners from Port Alice to Lubwa\'s in a few hours, instead of this part of the mail journey occupying three days, as has hitherto been the case.'}]","[{'document_title': 'TROUBLES IN CENTRAL AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Professor Bastian, of Berlin, has received the following letter from Dr. Fischer, the German African explorer, dated from Kagei: ""The state of affairs at Uganda is very serious.

The chief of the Christian party managed also to offend the King, and this became the signal for the outbreak of a fresh revolution. The Mohammedans attacked the Christians—who were obliged to flee for their lives, two of the chief among the latter being killed. The Mohammedans, supported by the Arabs, were now in the ascendant, new officers of state were appointed, and the missionaries—both French and English—were cast into prison, being after a few days released, and told to leave the country, with the injunction: ""Let no white man come to Buganda for two years. We do not want to see a white teacher back in Buganda till we have converted the whole people to the Mohammedan faith.""\n\nThere is a lesson to be learnt from this case, and what has lately happened to the German East African Company in Zanzibar. In both cases the Arab traders were the instigators, though in the latter case they seem to have had matters simplified for them by the action of the German East African and Imperial authorities. If it be true that the German ships have occasionally been guilty of promiscuously shelling the coast, ""simply to overawe the natives,"" we can hardly wonder at the influence obtained by these Arab traders. In the ordinary way there is not much reason for this alliance between the natives and the Arabs—as the intercourse of the latter is generally confined to kidnapping and enslaving the former. But the presence of a common enemy is sure to drive them into alliance together. And let us remember the native mind does not grasp the difference between one European power and another. It is not in the interests of the Arab to enlighten them—on the contrary, it is clearly to his advantage to persuade them that all Europeans are bent upon their destruction. The Arab influence in East Africa is already immense. The chief obstacle to its further development lies in the hostility of the native tribes, who have trusted Europeans in preference, because they found that these have been just and considerate; but according to latest accounts, the Germans seem bent upon changing all this, and forcing the natives to make common cause with the Arabs.

As matters have come to such a crisis, perhaps you will allow me to lay before your readers some details of the whole matter in dispute, by which they may be better able to judge whether such arrest was really justified by the facts.\n\nAfter the famous Berlin Conference of 1884, it was arranged by the British authorities that some one should be sent out to the Oil Rivers to proclaim a Protectorate on behalf of Great Britain over the whole district; and accordingly a gentleman was sent out as Consul, who was empowered to sign a treaty with the native kings and chiefs of the various places, of which Opobo, where Ja Ja is King, was one. One of the conditions of the treaty which Ja Ja signed (Article 6) expressly prohibited strangers going to the interior markets; this condition being further substantiated by a letter from the Consul to Ja Ja; the effect and intention of this being to secure that the European agents should only obtain their goods from the interior through Ja Ja and his chiefs.\n\nAbout two years ago, owing to the depression in the oil trade, some of these agents agreed among themselves that the price of the oil and other native productions should be reduced; and Ja Ja accordingly was communicated with upon the subject, and he expressed his readiness to accept their terms; but that the ""topside"" (a general term among the traders there, meaning commission) should be allowed to him and his chiefs, as before. This the agents would not agree to; they were willing to continue the usual topside to Ja Ja himself, but not to his chiefs. Ja Ja remonstrated with them, and pointed out that Opobo was made by himself and his chiefs. Immediately a white flag was hoisted in five of the factories, which meant that they stop all further business with the natives. One of the firms concerned refused to agree to this suspension, and continued to trade as before.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1887#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Reported Troubles in the Cameroons', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A recent telegram from Liverpool says that news received by the West African steamship Boma from the German colony of the Cameroons, which arrived in the Mersey on Nov. 11, shows that some serious disturbances have occurred there. The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs. Although one of the reports said that the Natives would rise against the Germans and drive them out of the river, it was not believed by the English that anything of the kind would be attempted, as the Germans a few years ago gave the Natives a lesson of their strength which they are not likely to forget.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""THE LATE KING M'TESA"", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The King of Uganda, whose death was announced recently, was probably the most notable potentate of purely native origin that the Dark Continent has produced. According to the estimate of Colonel Grant, who was his guest twenty-three years ago, M\'tesa was probably not more than forty-eight years of age at the time of his death, and, having succeeded his father, Suna, in 1857, he has reigned twenty-eight years. The Waganda have the names of thirty-five kings who have reigned down to the time of M\'tesa in regular succession, and this, as Colonel Grant points out, may probably account for the ""blue blood"" and vanity which certainly ran in the veins of M\'tesa. Probably, however, no other native African prince has been able to organize a state so completely and make so great an advance towards civilization as the King who has just died. Colonel Grant, who knew him well, speaks of him in terms of real respect, and his estimate is supported by Sir Samuel Baker and Mr. Stanley. As we know, the result of Mr. Stanley\'s visit was that missions were established in the country, which have had gratifying success. But M\'tesa was much perplexed when he learned that there are two Christian religions, the adherents of which are as hostile to each other as both are to Mahomedanism or heathenism. Doubtless from the European point of view M\'tesa was guilty of great cruelties; but these apparently indiscriminate sacrifices of human life were really the recognized and organized modes of administering justice in Uganda. M\'tesa himself was evidently a man governed largely by impulse. When Baker was all but defeated by the Wanyoro, a force from Uganda arriving in the distance was the cause of the dispersion of the enemy. M\'tesa forwarded letters from Baker to Livingstone by his swift-footed soldiers, who, after a journey of 600 miles, found the veteran traveller was dead. These and other facts show that M\'tesa was capable of taking a real interest in matters far outside the range of the ordinary savage mind. His army, wonderfully organized and disciplined, Mr. Stanley estimates at 125,000 men, and his fleet at 500 canoes. The population of Uganda proper is probably about 1,000,000, but, with neighbouring dependent territories, about 3,000,000. The capital is finely situated on the slopes of the north shore of Lake Victoria Nyanza. It is gratifying to learn that there have been comparatively little violence and bloodshed at the change of monarchy. It used to be the custom at the coronation for a new king to sacrifice his brothers—a custom which the latter evidently regarded as perfectly natural. M\'tesa\'s brothers, at the time of Colonel Grant\'s visit, went about in chains, but all the same, and though conscious of their fate, ""conversed and attended picnics, and boated, and played musical instruments with their brother, the King, with perfect freedom of action and of speech."" What the outside influences have been that have had a civilizing effect on Uganda before it was discovered by Europeans, we do not know; what they have been since, we do know pretty fully, and the results so far have been, on the whole, good.

England, France, Portugal, Germany, and Italy are attempting to obtain titles to the country. England has made annexation of the coast lying adjacent to her colony of Sierra Leone; France is forcing her way on the Senegal and toward the head-waters of the Niger; she threatens to annex the coast from the Gaboon to the Congo, some 250 miles, and is running her lines on the Upper Congo.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization? The Bible contains as good a code for the improvement of mind and manners as any book extant.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-16', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Central Africa and its Great Waterways', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Assuming that the Mobangi and Makua are one and the same river, Mr. Wills points out that this great waterway strikes at the very roots of the slave trade, and renders its suppression easy. Lupton Bey carried ivory from the Makua basin, on the Congo side of the watershed, overland to Meshra, and he claimed to show a net profit of £60,000. Its transport down the Mobangi will be far easier, and cheaper. ""Take away the ivory, turn a lucrative trade from Khartoum to the Congo, and the great incentive to slave-hunting and slave wars is gone."" The power of the Soudan rebels is broken; what will be the position of the slave-hunting tribes of the Soudan if they are approachable from the rear through a country peopled by natives—the Zandehs—who are eager for protection under European administrators, and whose countrymen are the soldiers who have helped Emin to hold out so long? No part of Africa offers a more interesting study to the scientific explorer. Readers of Dr. Schweinfurth will remember the Monbuttus of the region where the Makua rises, their king Mutnza, with his vast hall, and the highly developed political system which gave to their cannibalism something of the character of civilization. Not less remarkable are the Zandehs lower down the river, and the tribes which inhabit its islands and banks still further west. Should the Mobangi prove to be the Makua, the importance of the treaty by which the Free State has extended the boundary of French territory on the west bank of the Congo to a line drawn down the middle of the Mobangi will be vastly increased, as it may enable the French to tap the trade of the whole of the district south-east of Lake Chad to the district of the Nyanzas. Should the Makua be the upper waters of the Shari, the Royal Niger Company is not unlikely to enjoy similar advantages. It is possible, even in the other event—that is, if the Makua joins the Mobangi— that the Royal Niger Company may be able to approach by the Binúé or other rivers close to this magnificent highway to north-eastern Africa. In that case much would depend upon how far France might extend her claim to the north bank.

516,Educated Africans are urged to actively support societal progress and reform by resisting corruption and engaging in community development.,"The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that educated Africans are urged to actively support societal progress and reform, albeit with some differences in emphasis. The General History of Africa highlights the emergence of an educated elite, particularly in West Africa, who played a crucial role in refuting racist ideas and advocating for political and social reforms. Figures like James Africanus Horton and Edward Wilmot Blyden are noted for their intellectual contributions, challenging racial inferiority notions and promoting pan-Africanism. These educated individuals used their literacy and European contacts to implement reforms in traditional state structures, fostering a new consciousness of pride and confidence among black peoples. However, the textbook does not explicitly mention resisting corruption or engaging in community development. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize the active role of educated Africans in resisting corruption and engaging in community development. The articles highlight the importance of their involvement in promoting administrative reforms, resisting corrupt authorities, and supporting educational initiatives. They stress self-reliance and the need for Africans to help themselves, aligning with the claim of engaging in community development. Despite challenges like apathy and slow progress, the articles advocate for the active participation of educated Africans in societal progress and reform. Together, these sources illustrate a comprehensive picture of the roles and expectations of educated Africans in societal advancement, with The African Times providing a more explicit focus on resisting corruption and community engagement.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that align with the claim that educated Africans are urged to support societal progress and reform.

In various places, missionaries seeking converts often received a warm welcome from African rulers who, although very jealous of their inde- pendence and not keen to have their people converted, saw in missionary activities a possible access route to European education which might teach literacy and technical skills such as carpentry, printing and, if possible, also the manufacture of guns and gunpowder. The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces. The rulers tried to use European ideas in diplomacy, judicial reforms, military reorganization and in establishing a constitutional monarchy.$^{13}$ Similarly, beleaguered as they were by aggressive white racialism, a number of the new states in Southern Africa such as Moshoeshoe's kingdom of the Basuto accepted missionaries as their advisers and external champions, protected them and even prom› ulgated laws to assist them in their work of conversion.$^{14}$ In the Fante states on the Gold Coast and at other important missionary centres, notably Abeokuta in south-western Yorubaland, a number of Western-educated African leaders used their literacy and European contacts to get reforms carried out in the traditional state structures. These included the creation of chancelleries to be managed by literate Africans to control diplomatic relations with Europeans and guide the external relations of the states; the reform of tax systems by the introduction of regulated taxes in place of tolls and tribute; and the improvement of the judicial system by the introduction of record-keeping and putting enacted laws into writing. 15"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The abolitionist movement produced other far-reaching consequences for the area; of these, perhaps the most significant were those concerned with the modernization process.

The pioneers of this revolution in West Africa were undoubt› edly James Africanus Horton (1835-83) and Edward Wilmot Blyden (18321912). Among the works of Horton on the themes in question were Political Economy of British Western Africa, with the requirements of the several colonies and settlements: An African view of the Negro place in Nature (1865); West African Countries and Peoples: A Vindication of the African Race (1868); and Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast (1870). In West African Countries and Peoples, Horton refuted the idea of inherent racial inferiority of the black man by arguing that the difference in the stages of civilization between whites and blacks arose 'entirely from the influence of external circumstances'. To those who moved from the assump› tion of racial inferiority of the black to the assumption that he would ultimately disappear from the face of the earth in the face of white power, Horton argued: we find that wherever the African race has been carried to ... they increase, no matter under what depressing and burdensome yoke they may suffer; from which it may be safely inferred that the African people is a permanent and enduring people, and the fancies of those who had determined their destruction will go in the same limbo as the now almost defunct American slavery. 40 Finally, in answer to the proposition that the black was incapable of improvement, he argued: 'Africans are not incapable of improvement, but that by the assistance of good and able men they are destined to figure in the course of time, and to take a prominent part in the history of the civilized world'.$^{41}$ Again in his Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast, Horton wrote in the Preface: Horton not only condemned racism but was also one of the earliest advocates of pan-Africanism.

Blyden concluded: During all the years which have elapsed since the commencement of modern progress, the African race has filled a very humble and subordinate part in the work of human civilization. But the march of events is developing the interesting fact that there is a career before this people which no other people can enter upon. There is a peculiar work for them to accomplish, both in the land of their bondage, and in the land of their fathers, which no other people can achieve. With the present prospects and privileges before his race - with the chances of arduous work, noble suffering, and magnificent achievement before them - I would rather be a member of this race than a Greek in the time of Alexander, a Roman in the Augustin period, or an AngloSaxon in the nineteenth century. 46 It was also Blyden who in his famous speech to the American Col› onization Society in May 1880 gave great publicity to the phrase 'Ethiopia Stretching Out her Hands Unto God' and equated Ethiopian with African; and it was he who first used the term 'African personality' in his lecture delivered on 19 May 1893 in Freetown when he described the African Race as 'a Great Race - great in its vitality, in its power of endurance and its prospect of perpetuity'. He continued: It is sad to think that there are some Africans, especially among those who have enjoyed the advantages of foreign training, who are so blind to the radical facts of humanity as to say, 'Let us do away with the sentiment of Race. Let us do away with our African personality and be if possible in another Race ... Preach this doctrine as much as you like, no one will do it, for no one can do it, for when you have done away with your personality, you have done away with yourselves ... the duty of every man, of every race is to contend for its individuality to keep and develop it ... Therefore, honour and love your Race ... If you are not yourself, if you surrender your personality, you have nothing left to give to the world .. . 47 Another great leader of the intellectual revolution of the time was undoubtedly that fiery Yoruba-Creole evangelist, James Johnson (c. 18361917).

It was assumed that independence was a good thing and to strive for it was natural. Consequently, all those who had resisted European penetration of Africa, in order to preserve its inde› pendence, were heroes to be emulated and given an honourable place in the histories of the countries that had gained their independence through resistance to colonial rule. Put in these terms, this view is an attempt to use the standards of the present, with the aid of hindsight, to interpret the events of the past. In the colonial situation, those who resisted were described by colonial officials as short-sighted while those who collaborated were seen as far-sighted. Today, nationalist historians in East Africa con› demn so-called collaborators, especially chiefs, and praise resisters. 1\nAmong the resisters, there were also divisions. There were those who took to armed confrontation with the intruders - active resistance. Then there were those who, though they did not take to arms, refused to co› operate with the intruders. This form of resistance is referred to as passive resistance. There has not been a similar treatment of the so-called collaborators. They are often put together as simply one undifferentiated group.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.634, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Back-to-Africa movements', 'content': ""While in Liberia, Bishop Turner advised what he called American 'black capitalists' that 'if they would start trading with Liberia they would be worth millions in a few years'. Few responded, although a group did organize the African Development Society in 1899, the chief objective of which was to encourage Afro-Americans to buy land and settle in East Central Africa. The Society would sell shares or land rights offered by African petitioners but only to Afro-American or African purchasers. 4 Bishop Turner also later served as an adviser to the International Migration Society (IMS) of Alabama, which sent about 500 emigrants to Africa before it became defunct in 1900. Some of the 500 remained in Liberia; others returned to the United States. Those who remained fared reasonably well; evidently more than a few of them prospered. On the other hand, those who returned told horror stories of poor land, inadequate food and poor living conditions. These stories reduced the likelihood of any large-scale Afro-American emigration movement, even though prospects for blacks in the United States were declining from 1895 to 1900. Nevertheless, numerous Afro-Americans evidently continued to give serious consider› ation to African emigration, just as others in the United States and the Caribbean simply moved away from overt discriminatory practices into other regions near by.\nAfter the turn of the twentieth century, the back-to-Africa baton was picked up by others. For example, one Captain Dean, early in the twentieth century, hoped to engineer the settlement of American blacks in South Africa to fashion a powerful black state there. After the briefest sojourn meant to arrange for this settlement, however, white authorities expelled Dean from the Cape for what were termed 'provocative activities'. And in 1914, Chief Alfred C. Sam, a Gold Coast African, turned up in Oklahoma, persuaded about sixty black farmers that Africa offered them greater oppor› tunities and sailed with them to Saltpond in the Gold Coast. Finding Chief Sam's claims to be exaggerated and encountering restrictions from the Gold Coast officials which inhibited the entry of American immigrants, most of the Oklahomans eventually returned to the United States. But no one made so deep an impression as an advocate of emigration on Africans and American blacks alike as did Marcus Garvey who was born in Jamaica in 1887."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'The persistence and transformation of African cultural values in Latin America and the Caribbean', 'content': ""The forms of resistance already noted during the colonial period, when small numbers of fugitive slaves including half-castes banded together and attempted to live outside the system imposed by the colonizer, emerged in the late eighteenth century.

There is much to discourage us in our work for Africa and its people. It is so difficult to make those who, for themselves and their posterity, are most interested in the results we may achieve comprehend how hard the task of social and administrative reformation is; and that it is their and our duty to persevere in efforts to obtain and secure it, in spite of all the obstacles that vice and egotism, long enthroned evils in West Africa, may marshal against us. Vicious authority is rampant, insolent, and seductive, and its scoffs and sneers and bribes are not without effect among the victims at whose expense it exists, thrives, and debauches; and it is not difficult for it to induce many of them to range themselves on its side, and against those the best part of whose lives is being consumed in constant and unrewarded exertions to procure for them those changes which are indispensable to their social and national progress. Occasionally our path is cheered by some enthusiastic testimony to the good we are effecting; but for the most part we have to complain of a seeming apathetic indifference, which greatly dishonours those who evince it. We are entitled, after eleven years of unrequited labour, to say, that it is a flagrant disgrace to every African who can read and does not subscribe to this paper and pay for it. Men ought to feel ashamed to borrow it of their neighbours when they can themselves procure it by paying the modest sum of five shillings a-year for it. The letters which appear in this present number show the urgent necessity of administrative reforms as a means of obtaining what is of vital importance; these reforms must be forced upon the Government, Imperial and Local, as they will never be spontaneously accorded; and the only way in which they can be thus forced is by the publicity given to the evidences of need of them, in the columns of the African Times. There are doubtless some of the most intelligent of the educated Africans in every settlement who fully comprehend all this—and to them we say, they do not perform their duty by merely subscribing to and reading our paper; they ought to form themselves everywhere into committees for furthering subscriptions to it. Of course we can only expect this from independent, high-minded men, who are indifferent to paltry official bribes, and fearless of official disfavour; but surely there are some of these to be found in every British settlement on the West Coast, and we leave the matter for the present in their hands.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Great Demonstration in Honour of Mr. Chamerovzow, the Secretary of the Anti-Slavery Society', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Rev. J. Johnson, in seconding the resolution, said: When we remember that on the very spot we stand was a slave mart, whilst now free institutions have sprung up instead, through the exertions of our friends in England, we cannot but be thankful for what has taken place, and do all in our power to show a sense of gratitude to our benefactors. Philanthropists have done much and very much for us, and it is as little as we can do for ourselves to show that we are not ignorant of or ungrateful for their priceless service. When I contrast the present state of the colony with what it was in days gone by I am lost in astonishment at the changes that have been wrought. I remember being on one occasion at the Bananas where I was called upon to preach, and during my discourse I observed an old man who wept bitter tears. After the service was concluded, I asked him what in the discourse so sensibly affected him, when he replied, ""My son, I cannot refrain from weeping when I see our own children preaching to us the Gospel of peace. We had not that privilege, and had any one told me that I should be permitted to see our own children put in such a position I should not have believed it—I should have considered such a thing impossible."" Now I ask you, Gentlemen, by whose influence has this change, with others equally great and beneficial to our race, been brought about? Why, by the efforts of the good people in England. But the time has come when we should not look to them to do all for us; we are now capable to help ourselves, and to benefit by the example which they have set us. Through the kindness of some kind-hearted friends in that land who paid for my education, I owe my present standing. I am grateful for what has been done for my country and myself, and shall always endeavor to prove myself so. But I must say that our native merchants in good and prosperous circumstances do not do their duty to the country as they should. How many of the sons of the soil have been educated by any of them and at their expense? I know not of a single instance. Foreigners have come here and supported at our Grammar-school youths who have turned out a blessing to the country, whilst our own wealthy countrymen have shown themselves destitute of any feeling of their duty in this respect. Are we to leave everything to strangers to do for us? Are we never to put forth an effort to help ourselves? Is the whole burden to be thrown on our Anti-Slavery friends? I say no; we must be aroused to our duty. There is a great work before us, we have been made free, and in our turn we must free others. Slavery, as we all know, exists among the surrounding tribes; we must discourage it by pointing out its evil, and by sending the Gospel to enlighten and subdue them. We must do more than we have all along been doing; we must show our friends in England that their labor has not been spent in vain; we must prove our gratitude by copying their bright example. It is time that we form an Anti-Slavery Society among ourselves, to put down the hateful system wherever it is found in Africa. Those of us who have felt the bitterness know how it brutalizes man, the noblest of God\'s creatures, and how it destroys all his powers, both of body and mind. Now we are here called upon to recognize the claims which Mr. Chamerovzow, the noble Secretary of the Anti-Slavery Society, has on us. It is well known that this gentleman for eighteen years has been spending his time in advocating our cause, and opposing slavery wherever it existed. We have been told by another speaker that his services were so sparingly rewarded, owing to the very limited means of the society, that now that society is virtually extinct, we find Mr. Chamerovzow with a family unprovided for. We are called upon now to show our gratitude by raising a substantial testimonial to the Secretary, and we are to do this liberally in proportion to our means. This is a matter which concerns every son of Africa, for all have been benefited by the exertions of the noble Secretary and the society of which, I may say, he was the life. There must be, I say, no niggardly giving in this matter; we must give freely, liberally, and with all our heart.

If, as stated in my previous correspondence, such a school as the High-class School be amply and efficiently supported, it will prove a great boon to the place. That the educational work that is thus being inaugurated here needs such support as you have pleaded for will be evident from the fact that it has not been undertaken by the Church Missionary Society, as your remarks would seem to indicate, but by the sole efforts of some of the native residents of this place, who, sensible of the great educational wants of the community, have requested the Bishop of Sierra Leone to aid them in the establishment here of the Church of England with a properly-organized school; and the kind-hearted prelate, ever ready to lend a helping hand to every very good work, promised to aid their efforts in the undertaking. From this it will be seen that such needful help as you have advocated is a *sine qua non* in the proper development of education in this place; and should it be afforded, an efficient staff of competent teachers will be secured, and high-class schools, grammar schools, collegiate schools, and other seminaries of learning will be established along this Coast, which will undoubtedly be productive of unspeakable benefit to the country at large. This, Mr. Editor, in my humble opinion, will be the only panacea for the effectual eradication of the moral, social, and intellectual evil under which ""the land is groaning.""\n\nThe hope of this country\'s elevation seems to me to be in the rising and future generations, in the proper development of their intellectual faculties, and the instilment into their minds of the ""sweets"" of education.

And again: ""Religion would be best promoted in the end by making industrial pursuits the first aim (not before religion, but before head knowledge) in point of importance.

The agricultural improvement of the colony demands the special attention of Government authorities; and when, as in this case, a means is pointed out which only requires a better disposal of the revenues raised in the colony itself, by making them instrumental in obtaining reproductive results from the enforced labour of the criminal portion of the population, instead of that labour being wasted, as at present, no trivial objections or inapplicable theories ought to be allowed to stand in the way of its adoption. There is no wealthy landed proprietary in the colony, themselves acquainted practically with agricultural industry, who might, and would, if they existed, initiate efforts and experiments for developing the resources of the soil.

Liberia has been a black republic for forty years; Sierra Leone has been a negro colony for a century; and it cannot be denied that each of these communities has made very gratifying progress. Yet, upon Dr. Blyden's own showing, that progress has been but partial, he still has to complain of his countrymen's imitativeness and lack of backbone. The responsibility for this, undoubtedly, rests to some extent upon the unsuitable character of the education which the civilized negroes have received; but it is more to the purpose to remember that three generations is a very brief period in the development of a pagan people. How slow the work of civilization in Liberia has been may be seen from the fact that, whereas there are some twenty thousand Christian negroes in the republic, there are more than a million who are pagans. And now we inevitably come to the primary question of all: whether or not the presumed racial inferiority of the negro is proved. Dr. Blyden pleads eloquently for his fellows, and triumphantly asks: How could an inferior race have produced Toussaint L'Ouverture? The question is not unnatural, but it is far from logical. The matter, as it fashions itself to us, is, and is likely to remain for a long time to come, an open one. The negro has, as yet, enjoyed no sufficient opportunity of proving either his mental equality with or his inferiority to the white. The experience of Sierra Leone and Liberia, so far as it has gone, has been in his favour; what we know of his moral history in that other black republic, Hayti, and in the United States, is at the best negative. As time goes on, the question, which is far more momentous than would appear to the unthinking, will settle itself. Emigration from America to Liberia, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, is proceeding satisfactorily; and Dr. Blyden states that 200,000 negroes in the United States are prepared to return to the land of their fathers. But colonization by private effort is, at the best, exceedingly slow; and in this instance it is perhaps well that it is so, since the gradual settlement of Liberia is far more likely to provide material for a strong and healthy State than a hasty rush would be. Social reformers for many a year to come will watch the experiment, as they have watched it in the past, with keen interest. The chief danger lies, as Dr. Blyden constantly points out, in the tendency to Europeanize the negro—to supersede customs and practices which are useful and often necessary in Africa by customs utterly out of place there. The ill-directed zeal of some of the less reflective missionaries has, no doubt, been to blame for some of this; but there is, we fancy, very little to complain of upon this head now. Let it be once proved beyond all doubt that negroes can found flourishing colonies, can develop the limitless resources of the continent which has been the cradle of their race; and, above all, that they can govern themselves prudently and self-reliantly,—and there will open up before the black man the assurance of a future as splendid and far-reaching as any that ever presented itself to a white conqueror."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1887#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Mission Work at the Cameroons', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I might go to a far greater length, but I fear I have already trespassed too far upon your column.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.\nThis flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours. This route also linked Yorubaland with Borgu, Hausaland, Borno and beyond. The Christian missionary journeys across the wide expanse of Yorubaland from north to south and east to west and between Yorubaland and Dahomey were made possible because the necess› ary interconnecting routes already existed.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...''

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.71, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The changing balance of power', 'content': 'The general effect of these developments was to intensify the competition among the Europeans. Partly in response to the French forward policy, the British showed no less eagerness to consolidate and defend their positions. The discovery of diamonds in 1869-70 in Griqualand West in South Africa, and the prospects of finding gold in large quantities, began to raise the fever of competition and alter the basis of the relationship between Europeans in Africa and between them and the Africans. Various European activities, hitherto pursued seemingly for their own sake or for humanitarian purposes, began to be re-evaluated from the point of view of their contribution to various European national interests. Explorers were no longer expected merely to satisfy scientific curiosity but were also encouraged to gather strategic intelligence and trade secrets. Missionaries were not just individual servants of God obeying a divine call to evangelize but were regarded as organized national agents of acculturation, part of whose objective was to weaken the cultural and commercial exclusivity of their hosts. Traders were not just seeking profit, but were preparing the way for their own nations to establish control. Thus the widespread collaboration between Africans and Europeans, seemingly to utilize Euro› pean ideas and European technologies for nation-building in the rev› olutionary situation of the nineteenth century began to be seen as subversive, contributing directly to the systematic abortion of the efforts of African leaders to reform and modernize their societies.\nIn the same vein, African rulers generally viewed the activities of abolitionists as negative. In many cases, with the ending of the Atlantic slave trade, and after resisting and stalling, they began to co-operate to the extent that alternative trade in agricultural produce, gold, ivory and other commodities came to replace the slave trade and there was no interference with the holding of slaves and other sources of enforced labour. There was thus a basis for co-operation. As noted above, increased use of slaves was the basis of that co-operation. The Europeans recognized this, but in the 1870s, while not abandoning that position, began to use emancipation as a potential factor for weakening the economic base of African states. It should be specifically noted in this connection that most of the armies the Europeans were raising were manned by emancipated African slaves loyal to their redeemers, who armed and commanded them.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Political structures', 'content': ""Christianity served a similar purpose, providing a cultural framework for creating a Creole society out of disparate groups of peoples settled in Freetown and surrounding villages, as in various settlements on the Liberian coast, or in Libreville, Freretown, and other freed slave settlements. In various places, missionaries seeking converts often received a warm welcome from African rulers who, although very jealous of their inde- pendence and not keen to have their people converted, saw in missionary activities a possible access route to European education which might teach literacy and technical skills such as carpentry, printing and, if possible, also the manufacture of guns and gunpowder. The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces. The rulers tried to use European ideas in diplomacy, judicial reforms, military reorganization and in establishing a constitutional monarchy.$^{13}$ Similarly, beleaguered as they were by aggressive white racialism, a number of the new states in Southern Africa such as Moshoeshoe's kingdom of the Basuto accepted missionaries as their advisers and external champions, protected them and even prom› ulgated laws to assist them in their work of conversion.$^{14}$ In the Fante states on the Gold Coast and at other important missionary centres, notably Abeokuta in south-western Yorubaland, a number of Western-educated African leaders used their literacy and European contacts to get reforms carried out in the traditional state structures. These included the creation of chancelleries to be managed by literate Africans to control diplomatic relations with Europeans and guide the external relations of the states; the reform of tax systems by the introduction of regulated taxes in place of tolls and tribute; and the improvement of the judicial system by the introduction of record-keeping and putting enacted laws into writing. 15"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The structure of Volume VII', 'content': ""Many European historians have condemned the opposers as being romantic and short-sighted and have praised the so-called collaborators as being far-sighted and progressive.

If they were less farsighted, less fortunate or less well-advised, they would see their traditional enemies siding with the invader and would themselves assume an attitude of resistance, which could all too easily end in military defeat, the deposition of chiefs, the loss of land to the native allies of the occupying power, possibly even to the political fragmen› tation of the society or state ...

On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': ""This difference in time factor is important in any attempt to account for the differential impact of the forces of change on the different regions and countries of Africa. That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters.

In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'Military conquest, 1885-1902 > Why were European powers able to conquer Africa?', 'content': ""Fourthly, while the period after the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-8 was marked, according to J. Holland Rose, by 'a state of political equilibrium which made for peace and stagnation in Europe',$^{58}$ the same period in Africa was marked by inter-state and intra-state conflict and rivalry - the Mandingo against the Tukulor, the Asante against the Fante, the Baganda against the Banyoro, the Batoro against the Banyoro, the Mashona against the Ndebele, etc. Thus, while Europe could focus her attention militarily almost exclusively on her imperial activities overseas without any distraction at home, African states and countries had their attention divided. Moreover, in addition to enjoying peace at home, however divided the European powers were on imperial and colonial issues, throughout the era of partition and up to 1914 they always managed to resolve these questions without resort to war. Thus, in spite of the intense competition and the numerous crises in Africa, the European powers involved in the partition displayed a remarkable spirit of solidarity which not only elimi› nated wars among them but also prevented the African rulers and com› munities from effectively playing one European power against the other. Throughout the period under review, various European powers took on the African states one at a time, and on no occasion was an African state assisted by one European power against another.\nBy contrast, the behaviour of the African states was not only marked by lack of solidarity, unity or co-operation but some of them did not hesitate to ally with the invading European forces against their neighbours, only to be vanquished later themselves. The Baganda allied with the British against the Banyoro, and the Barotse with the British against the Ndebele, while the Bambara teamed up with the French against the Tukulor.$^{59}$ As a result of all this, the heroic and memorable stands which the Africans took against the European invaders were - as will be seen in subsequent chapters$^{60}$ - more often than not, isolated forms of uncoordinated resist› ance, even at the regional level."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The structure of Volume VII', 'content': 'A great majority of African rulers, then, did opt for the defence of their sovereignty and independence. It is in the strategies and the tactics that they adopted to achieve this universal objective that they differed. Most African rulers chose the strategy of confrontation, using either diplomatic or military weapons or both. As will be seen below, Samori Ture, and Kabarega of Bunyoro resorted to both weapons while Prempeh I and Mwanga of Buganda relied on diplomacy. Others such as Tofa of Porto Novo (in what is now Benin) chose the strategy of alliance or co-operation, not of collaboration.\nThis question of strategy should be highlighted here because it has been 12.

We are opposed to the use of this term collaboration not only because it is inaccurate but also because it is derogatory and Eurocentric. As we have seen above, the fundamental issue at stake between the 1880s and the 1900s as far as the African rulers were concerned, was that of sove› reignty, and on this, it was quite clear that nobody was prepared to compromise. Those African rulers who have been mistakenly termed collaborators were those who thought that the best way of safeguarding their sovereignty or even regaining the sovereignty that they might have lost to some African power previous to the arrival of the Europeans was not to collaborate but rather to ally with the European invaders. A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation. But as we have seen, the Africans were all faced with the question of surrendering, retaining or regaining their sovereignty. Those who threw in their lot with the Europeans therefore had their own objective, and it is therefore totally wrong to call them collaborators.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'Military conquest, 1885-1902 > Why were European powers able to conquer Africa?', 'content': ""The final and easily the most decisive factor was, of course, the over› whelming logistic and military superiority that Europe enjoyed over Africa. While Europe was using professional and well-drilled armies, very few African states had established standing armies and fewer still had pro› fessional armies. Most African states recruited and mobilized individuals on an ad hoc basis for either defence or offence. Besides, in addition to their own armies, the European powers could always, as A. Isaacman and J. Vansina have contended, rely on African mercenaries and levies which gave them the numerical superiority they needed.$^{61}$ In fact, as A. Laroui puts it, most of the armies were African in recruitment and only European in command. Above all, by the terms of the Brussels Convention of 1890, the imperial powers agreed not to sell arms to Africans. This meant that most African armies were armed with completely outmoded, old and often unserviceable guns, mainly flint-locks or muzzle-loading muskets, and had plates 2.2(a)-(f) Weapons used by Africans and their European opponents during the wars between 1880 and 1935 (for Plate 2.2(f) see next page) no heavy artillery or naval power whatsoever. The European armies, on the other hand, were armed with the most up-to-date heavy artillery, and guns such as the repeater rifle, and above all the Gatling and the Maxim guns. They also used the heavy artillery of naval forces. As Laroui has pointed out, even motor vehicles and aeroplanes62 were used in the later campaigns. It is significant that the two African leaders who were able to inflict some defeats on the Europeans, Samori and Menelik, managed to obtain some of these up-to-date weapons. But in the end even Samori too was overpowered by the French. The overwhelming superiority that Europe enjoyed over Africa is summed up succinctly in Hilaire Belloc's famous couplet already quoted in Chapter 1.\nIn view of these economic, political and above all military and techno¬ logical advantages enjoyed by European powers over African polities, the contest was a most uneven one and it is not at all surprising that the former could vanquish the latter with such relative ease.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

Cre› ativity became especially necessary where a small number of Europeans lived among a large number of Africans as was the case in many colonies of exploitation such as Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Saint-Domingue. Where the European population failed to comprise a critical mass, the Africans had to build a society from a diverse collectivity of individuals who had little more in common than their skin colour and their servility. The adoption of their customs and behaviour by the non-African sector indicated the measure of their success.\nAfricans did not always conform to the society into which they were thrust. For centuries marronage, or the flight from the slave system, existed as an integral aspect of slavery.$^{53}$ In Brazil, the north-east witnessed the establishment of the quilombo of Palmares which lasted almost a century and which was eliminated only with the largest military force ever mounted in the Americas by the Portuguese and Brazilians. Maroon towns existed for equally long periods in Esmeraldas in Ecuador and in parts of the Blue Mountains and the Cockpit Country of Jamaica. Marronage manifested not only the wish to be free, it was an eloquent and visible condemnation of the system of slavery by Africans.\nBy the time African slavery was eliminated in the Americas, the position of the African sector had worsened dramatically from what it had been a century before. The political and economic reconstruction that followed the Civil War in the USA accompanied a movement of legal discrimination and social and economic exclusion of the non-white sector, characterized by segregated institutions, lynchings, and overtly racist societies and organ› izations, which combined until the middle of the twentieth century.$^{54}$ The general conditions experienced by black Americans then compared with those prevailing today in a more extreme way in South Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The diaspora in Europe', 'content': 'This community of Africans in Europe was also concentrated in certain occupations, especially domestic service, this being partly a carry-over from the occupational status of Africans who came by way of West Indian slavery, partly a reflection of the European fad for exotic servants.

Another significant, if smaller, group was made up of students, who began to arrive in Europe in significant numbers by the middle of the eighteenth century and, in increasing numbers, throughout the nineteenth century. In an era in which commercial contact between Europe and Africa was increasing, it was an obvious advantage to African traders to be literate in a Western language and to have some acquaintance with European accounting practices. Many of these students therefore came to Europe through the good offices of European slave-traders operating in Africa and studied under their care in the principal slave-trade ports like Liverpool or Nantes.\nStill another peculiarity of the African communities in Europe was the fact that they were overwhelmingly male. This fact had two important implications. The African community was not self-sustaining. It had to be, and was, constantly replenished from overseas. This is not to say that the Africans had no sexual relations with European women, but the products of these relationships tended to be culturally European rather than African. After a few generations, the African physical appearance tended to disappear into the general European genetic pool.\nSome Africans also found their way into Eastern Europe, in spite of a more attenuated maritime contact with tropical Africa itself. There, the main line of entry was by way of the Ottoman slave trade, which was not mainly a trade in North Africans, but included sub-Saharan Africans drawn across the Sahara to Ottoman-associated ports like Tripoli, or brought north down the Nile from what is now the southern Sudan.$^{32}$ In a few instances, small pockets of African culture persisted in parts of the Ottoman empire into the twentieth century, such as a small Hausa-speaking com› munity in what is now Yugoslavia.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Pan-Africanism: political and cultural aspects', 'content': ""Besides these educational exchanges, a series of pan-Africanist organizations and conferences, as well as commercial and literary or cultural activities 47.

The reputation and resources of Tuskegee, however, were brought to Africa by African and American alumni and, often, by numerous African visitors to Tuskegee or correspondents with Washington who had never been matriculated students. Consequently, through the media of numerous international conferences, visitations, and technical missions, many Africans were touched by the 'Tuskegee Spirit' or drew upon Tuskegee's and other American black resources."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 163, 'article_title': 'Speke and Grant joined by Petherick on the White Nile', 'full_section_title': 'Speke and Grant joined by Petherick on the White Nile', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-18', 'issue_date': '23_05_1863', 'content': 'Sir,—It will be a relief to the public anxiety respecting the fate of Mr. Petherick, whose death had been announced some time ago in a telegram from Alexandria, to hear the good news that he is alive and well, having effected a junction with Captains Speke and Grant at Gondokoro, on the White Nile, on the 23rd of February.\n\nIn reference to the great question of the sources of the Nile, Captain Speke thus writes to me:—\n\n""I said I would do it, and I have done it.

But their good-will was also shown in a more practical form, for from far and near carriers arrived, offering their services; and so Mr. Young had no difficulty in obtaining the number (800) he required, and was served with such right good-will that he tells me many of them carried unusually heavy loads for upwards of sixty miles, that others came from distances of forty miles to participate in the work, and that he only paid each man three fathoms of calico for doing the entire distance of about seventy miles, besides feeding themselves. Mr. Young expected to have his vessel all ""a-tauto"" again by the 6th of October, and fairly launched on the waters of the Upper Shiré, leading to that grand inland sea, Lake Nyassa, and thus, in all probability, be the first person to place a steam-vessel on one of the important African lakes. Mr. Young also found time on his way up to erect an iron cross; sent out by Miss Mackenzie, in memory of her beloved brother the Bishop, who so nobly died at his post in 1862.

We employed 800 carriers to convey our goods and ship across the cataracts, and nothing was lost or injured. I have tried the steamer in a stiff breeze on the lake, and she is a good sea boat, and will steam seven knots with the one boiler. I have left the greater part of the party to build houses near Cape M\'Clear, while I have come down to take up the remainder of our luggage. Thus far I think the whole affair a great success. It\'s true I have worn down a great deal, but have some mettle left in me yet. I start for Nyassa again to-morrow. On Nyassa I came up with one of the slave dhows, but she had no slaves on board, being bound for a cargo. Before we got near her they lowered their sail, and the master, coming from Zanzibar, at once said in broken English, ""Me no got slaves in."" We are a wonder and astonishment to all Arabs and natives; the former shake their heads, no doubt thinking that their game is up. There are five dhows on the lake. Before entering Nyassa, I called on the powerful chief, M\'Punda, through whose dominions all the slaves for the coast pass. He was very civil, and made us presents, and gave us permission to settle on any part of his land. He owns the whole of the Cape M\'Clear peninsula, and for a few pieces of calico I have reason to believe would allow slaves passing through his dominions. If you can do anything to bring it about, it would prove a great blessing to thousands of poor creatures. Please write me, and give me your advice.\n\n""Dr. Stewart has not arrived yet, and if he does not soon I intend going round the lake.\n\n""The whole of the party are very well indeed, and have been so; in fact, we have had no sickness, and the climate of Nyassa is delightful. We sleep with two blankets over us, and during the day we have a beautiful breeze off the lake. There is not a single native we have met with but is rejoiced to see us. I will have a look round, and tell you what the country produces. Had no news from England since leaving the Cape, and am sending this by a negro, in hopes that it may reach you some day.\n\n""There has not been, as far as I am aware, the least hitch with any of the party, and they are all becoming daily more used to their work, especially Dr. Laws and the carpenter, who are particularly well suited to this kind of life, and have most ably assisted me.

An exhibition of his collections in Kimberley, the chief town of the diamond fields, failed to bring him any money, the ignorant inhabitants feeling no interest in his scientific curiosities, and want stared him in the face. But reports of his explorations had reached Europe, and his distress was relieved by the receipt of small remittances of money sent by the Emperor of Austria and the Geographical Society of Vienna. With this money and with what he earned after recovering from his illness, by giving lectures in the towns of Cape Colony and writing articles for scientific journals in Europe, he was able in 1879 to pay his passage money home and ship his scientific treasures. He found many honours awaiting him there, and he has just published at Vienna the first of three volumes describing his travels.

He had not to speak of unthought-of prospects for their trade and fresh fields for philanthropic work. He proposed to carry them into the classic lands of African exploration, redolent of memories in connexion with Park, Clapperton, Denham, Lander, Barth, and a host of others. His object was to remind them of the heritage bequeathed to the British through the enterprise of those great travellers, and won at the cost of manifold hardships. He undertook the task more readily as there seemed to be an incredible amount of ignorance with regard to the Central Soudan. Few are aware of the existence of semi-civilized negro empires in the very heart of Africa, and the names of Sokoto, Kano, Kukawa, Yakoba, Illorin, and Bida are known but to the student. The geographical knowledge of the many is restricted to a hazy idea of the existence of a town named Timbuctoo, near which the Niger flows on its way to the Atlantic. It must not, however, be imagined, though the world was thus ignorant of this important region, that it had been utterly ignored and left untouched. Far from it. For years past the National African Company has been at work establishing itself on the river. From point to point it has worked its way, till its factories extend far into the very heart of the continent. Till lately the Company had been content to feel its way, laying a solid commercial basis in each district before entering into the heart of Central Africa. With the rise of the African craze and the scramble for Africa, it became of importance that the position of the Company should be secured, lest the labours of half a century should be ruined by some startling development of foreign commercial enterprise. Communication must be opened up with the two great Sultans—viz., Maliké of Gandu and Umuru of Sokoto—into whose territories the Company had found its way. To undertake this work he had been selected, and he embraced the opportunity of seeing something of Western Africa and the Niger basin. Thus it was that he transferred himself from his field of research in Eastern Africa to the other side of the continent. Speaking of the gin trade on the coast, he said that it was a scandal and a shame. Having reached the town of Rabba, the furthest factory of the National African Company, preparations were made for the land journey. The caravan consisted of three Europeans—Mr. Thomson, Mr. Hamilton, his companion from England, and Mr. W. J. Seags, who took charge of the financial matters of the expedition. Then followed two educated Coast natives. The rest of the caravan consisted of natives—Brassmen, Kruboys, and Fantees, from Akra and Elmina. On the 9th of April the caravan set out, taking the road which leads to Koutokora, in the hope that they might proceed direct to Sokoto instead of having to take the circuitous river route. On reaching Jega, we were on the great trade route which connects Timbuctoo and the Western Soudan with Bornu, and the kingdoms of the Chad region. Hitherto we had passed through sparsely populated districts, or countries desolated by war. Now, however, we had reached a healthy densely populated part, which throbbed with commercial activity. The enormous trade carried on along this trunk line was to me a never-failing source of wonderment, so unlike was it to anything I had elsewhere seen or imagined.

This letter takes up the narrative of the expedition from the time when Stanley Pool was left behind. He arrived at that place with his followers on the verge of famine, and his efforts to leave a spot where food was so scarce were for some time frustrated by the reluctance of certain missionaries to surrender their steamers to the use of the expedition. From the moment the flotilla left Stanley Pool all seems to have altered for the better. The gloomy tone of the previous letter changes for high spirits and humour. Thus he narrates how the Stanley, the largest of his steamers, came to grief. She ""had been exploring some ragged reefs on an independent course, and had rashly attempted to plough them up."" The Peace, borrowed from the English Baptist Mission at Stanley Pool, did not begin brilliantly. First she broke her rudder, and was forced to put back for repairs; then she gradually lost vital energy until she began to travel down instead of upstream. Then her engineer, ""smarting under the imputation that his steamer was no better than a mud-scow, took counsel with a canny Scotch colleague,"" and the two hit upon the expedient of screwing the safety-valve down to retain the constantly-escaping steam. The result was that the Peace from that time was ever in the van, instead of the rear, and Mr. Stanley recommends her builder to have the invention patented at once. This cheery tone is explained by the statement that since leaving Bolobo there had been ""no losses in men or goods, no famine, no inconvenience, no cause of anxiety."" Mr. Stanley\'s next letter is that which enables us to disregard the rumours of his death. It is dated June 19, at the Yambuya Rapids, on the Aruwimi River. This was the point at which the route of the expedition leaves the Congo River, and turns inland. Mr. Stanley arrived at Yambuya on the 19th, and immediately began to form a camp as a base of operations for the march along the banks of the Aruwimi to Wadelai. The country in the neighbourhood of his camp is covered with villages. But the natives were being conciliated by kind treatment, and even if they were inclined to be hostile, his information represented the various tribes as too much split up to be capable of much mischief. Everything, therefore, is in favour of an unopposed march to Wadelai.'}, {'id': 5594, 'article_title': 'THE GERMANS IN AFRICA', 'full_section_title': 'THE GERMANS IN AFRICA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1887#article-6', 'issue_date': '01_10_1887', 'content': 'An expedition under Lieut.

The author commenced by saying that he proposed to place before his audience certain facts illustrative of one of the most urgent questions of the day—namely, the influence of the Arab traders in Central Africa. He invited his hearers to accompany him into a region of Central Africa unknown to Arabs and Europeans until 1881. That region was bounded by the Sankuru and the Lomami, the former of which was first crossed by Dr. Pogge and himself, and the latter was first made known through Commander Cameron. This region was inhabited by the Bene Ki, a division of the Basonge. One day in January 1882 he and his party found themselves encamped near the western entrance of a large city, which happened to be occupied by the clan of the Bagna Pesihi. Dr. Pogge, himself, and the black interpreter mounted their oxen and started. With their followers, men and women, they marched along—a procession 200 in number. Glades on either side afforded glimpses of the homesteads of the Bagna Pesihi. There were gardens in front, where wild hemp, tobacco, tomatoes, red pepper, gourds, bananas, sugar cane, and various medicinal plants were cultivated. Pot-bellied goats, with short legs, sheep, and fowls, moved about in all directions. The day of their visit was quite an ""event."" To the natives they were ""two white men from the unknown country where the sun does not set, riding on strange animals."" Rumour said they were sons of the spirit Bena Kalunga. The people, full of expectancy, gathered about the doors, and silence reigned around. Clearly the natives were not quite free from apprehension. As the procession moved along Lieutenant Wissmann shouted, ""Arms down; no war,"" and all distrust was soon removed. They camped at the other end of the town, and between 4,000 and 5,000 Bagna Pesihi visited them, desirous of trading. No discord occurred, and the party presently left the gentle, cheerful savages. Four years later Lieutenant Wissmann again visited the district; but what a change was there! All was silent and solitary, grass grew in the streets, and skulls and human bones lay about. The Bakalanga, with the long white garments, had been there, and they had devastated the district. Then famine and small-pox had come to complete the work. How, asked Lieutenant Wissmann, could these regions be made to participate in the blessings of civilization? The work would require large means, but it was a noble work. It must be undertaken quickly.\n\nSubsequently the Chairman said Sir F. de Winton would make a statement about what he knew, or what he thought probable, regarding the present position of Mr. Stanley.

They discovered unmistakeable traces of gold on the Olchitanda, in Cassinga, and on both sides of the Kunene, the banks of which they describe as very healthy. They infer that a very brisk weapon trade with the natives of German South-West Africa is carried on on the Kunene, from the fact that the Natives wanted to buy ammunition of them, with oxen, ""for the war with the Germans""—a desire which, of course, remains ungratified. The travellers discovered a small and, hitherto, unknown bay, three kilometres broad, about thirty kilometres south of the mouth of the Kunene, and named it the Augusta Victoria Bay, after the German Empress.

The letter is dated from Kuihara, near Taboza, and was written on the 17th of October. The Abbé Debaize naturally begins with his own expedition, which had so far been successful. He says: ""Yesterday the caravan of the French Expedition, with flags flying and music playing, entered Kouikouron, the capital of Unyanyembe. The most sympathetic reception was given to us by the thousands of negroes who gathered round us. The Sultan and the Governor came out to receive us at the entrance to the capital, and conducted us to a vast building, the same as was given to Cameron when he passed here. So far, my journey has been most fortunate, and I am proud to say, for the honour of the Government of the Republic, that the French Expedition promises to be a great success. Of the five hundred men forming my caravan not one has deserted, and I have not lost a single thing. From Zanzibar to the present spot I have not ceased to enjoy perfect health.""\n\nThe other expeditions do not appear to be so well favoured. The Abbé Debaize alludes to two in particular—namely, the Belgian Expedition and that of the Missionary Fathers of Algeria. As regards the Belgians, he says: ""They have experienced troubles of all kinds. At Meromero a revolt broke out in their camp. Two hundred and eighty of their men abandoned them, carrying off with them a quantity of valuable goods. At Mpuapona one of their Zanzibar men was wounded by a native.\n[APRIL 1, 1879.]\n\n---\n\nTo avenge him, they killed five of the inhabitants. The whole of the country rose, and war was imminent. The English were obliged to interfere to put an end to the affair. On arriving at Crumbo, the remainder of the men of the Belgian caravan deserted; fresh servants had to be found, and at length the Expedition reached Mirambo, but almost ruined. The missionaries from Algeria, who are going to establish stations on Lake Tanganyika and in the Uganda country, have not been more fortunate than the Belgians. They had to pay a ruinous sum for the right to pass through the Ugogo. They were abandoned by their native servants, and, in addition, attacked by a band of brigands, who stole several valuable chests from them.

The very atmosphere was electric with the most wonderful schemes—religious, philanthropic, and commercial—for the exclusive benefit of the negro.

The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation. They never heard now of the trader who went to Africa with the merely selfish object of making his fortune. Each and all became pioneers of civilisation, thinking only of the native first and self afterwards. They spoke as if the good to the native had been enormous, and that their intercourse with him had been a benefit and blessing. They pointed with pride to their sacrifices in the suppression of the slave trade, to their West Coast settlements as centres of secular light and leading; to their missionary stations as stars twinkling in the night of heathendom; to the returns of their trade with every entrance to the heart of Africa, as showing the spread of their beneficial influence. They saw that the work of other nations had been pernicious in the extreme, that they had been brutal in their dealings with native races, and had thought only of their own sordid interests and national aggrandisement—all in marked contrast to their aims and methods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICAN EXPLORATION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Four exploring parties are now preparing to start from Belgium for Africa.

We had buried our first-born there, a little boy of six years.\n\nBut poor Africa—what can be done for her?

She needs missionaries and teachers, but these alone will not do the work needed. Accompanying them should be (2) farmers and mechanics, who can teach them civilization, for both must go together—civilization and Christianity: either without the other will fail; but both united will, with God's blessing, lift her up, and soon give her a place among the nations.\n\nShe has natural resources abundant. 1. The people are capable of being educated in the arts and sciences, in which they make rapid proficiency when an opportunity is provided. In managing business, mercantile or other, they manifest an ability equal to the whites. The richest men in Sierra Leone are negroes who were taken out of the slave ship.

Rice, Indian corn, and some smaller grains, suited to exportation, can be produced to any extent. Ginger, pepper, arrowroot, can be supplied to meet the wants of the world. Coffee and cotton of fine quality grow wild abundantly, and can be cultivated to any extent to supply Manchester and every cotton factory in Christendom. There only needs to do this to start it all along the Western Coast, and make a market for them, and the natives will go to producing them. They will work at what they can make the most money by. Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down.

It sent out its first missionaries in January, 1878, and is consequently seven years old this autumn. Its object was to enter Central Africa by means of the great Congo, or Livingstone water-way, just then descended for the first time by Stanley, and demonstrated to be the most important and direct route into the heart of the lost continent. Its plan was to evangelise, by means of industrial mission-stations, the tribes and nations occupying the vast basin of the Congo river, and constituting at that time an almost unknown world, equalling in area the whole of the United States this side of the Rocky Mountains. Even a summary of the history of the undertaking during the past seven years, touching and stirring though it is in all its details, is impossible within the space at command. The Mission was established in connexion with no large society, with no one denomination able to supply it with ample resources; its original council was a very small one, and though some of its members were most liberal, the demands of the Mission soon surpassed its resources. The East London Institute was then led to assume the sole management and financial responsibility of the society; and despite the serious physical, financial, social, and moral obstacles lying at first in the way of the Mission, progress has been made, and satisfactory results achieved. At the outset the climate of the country proved very trying and fatal to Europeans, while the difficulties, dangers, and cost of travelling and transport were immense. Two hundred miles of cataracts and rapids made the river just where it passes through a mountainous country of no use as a highway, and the distance consequently had to be traversed on foot. Carriers had to be imported at heavy cost from a distance of a thousand miles, as the natives refused, from timidity, to act as such. Without carriers, progress was impossible in a country where money is unknown, barter goods bulky, and roads and beasts of burden alike lacking. Large outlay was consequently inevitable if the pioneers of civilization were to penetrate into the interior. The people were found to be sunk in utter ignorance and most degrading superstitions, and addicted in consequence to revolting cruelties and abominations. Their language had to be reduced to writing and systematized, and work of every kind had to be done amid incessant interruptions from sickness and death. Ten Europeans have laid down their lives in this heroic struggle during its brief course, and many others have been invalided home. Fifty brethren and sisters in all have been sent out on the staff, and yet it consists to-day of only six-and-twenty. This may give some idea of the large amount of fruitless outlay necessitated by work in such an unhealthy country. Some constitutions acclimatize with difficulty, others never; while some fall victims to fever as soon as they reach their destination, and before commencing work.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1884#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MR.

Taking a bird's-eye view of the whole situation in time and space, so that each factor might assume its proper relative position and proportion, he unhesitatingly affirmed in the plainest language that so far their intercourse with African races, instead of being a blessing, had been little better than an unmitigated curse to them. These were strong statements, they would say, and required confirmation. If true, what could possibly have caused this frightful miscarriage of the noblest aspirations of a Christian people? The answer was simply the nature of their commerce with Africa in the past and present.

Just a little before the discovery of America thousands of the natives of the Congo were baptised by Catholic missionaries, and the Portuguese devoted themselves to the work of African evangelisation and exploration. They knew then as much of interior Africa as is known now after the great exploits of Livingstone and Stanley. There is a map in the Vatican, 300 years old, which gives the general physical relief and the river and lake systems of Africa with more or less accuracy; but the Arab geographers of a century before had described the mountain system, the great lakes, and the course of the Nile. Just about the time that Portugal was establishing a great empire on that continent, America was discovered, and it became the seat of Portuguese Power. Neither Egyptian, Carthaginian, Persian, or Roman influence was allowed to establish itself on that continent. It would seem that no solution of the African problem was to come from alien sources. Africans were not to share the fate of other dark races who have come in contact with the European. Europe was diverted to the Western Hemisphere. The energies of that conquering race were spent in building up a home for themselves on this side. Africa followed in chains.\n\nThe Negro race was to be preserved for a special work in the future. It is probable that if foreign races had been allowed to enter their country they would have been destroyed. So they were brought over to be helpers in America and at the same time to be preserved. Slavery would seem to be a strange school in which to preserve a people; but God has a way of salting as well as purifying by fire. The Europeans found in America an aboriginal race unable to co-operate with them in the labours required for the construction of the new civilisation. The Indians would not work, and have suffered the consequences of that indisposition: they have passed away. To take their place as accessories in the work to be done, the African was brought, who could work and would work, and could endure the climatic conditions of a new southern country, which Europeans could not. If Europe brought the Negro, Africa furnished the hands for the work which has been achieved. But when the new continent was opened Africa was closed.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

Herr Krause intends to follow the Niger from its mouth upwards for a distance of about 300 miles, and then probably to take up his position in some suitable spot, whence he can make a general survey of the surrounding country, decide on his further course of action and await a favourable opportunity for an advance into the interior. The field for exploration will include the east and central territory of the Fulen (Felata Fulbe) and that of the Haussa Musik people.

He stated that the continent of Africa had an area of nearly a quarter of the entire land of the globe, and it had presented greater obstacles to human enterprise than any other part of the earth's surface. Notwithstanding the many explorations of scientific people and travellers, both recently and in ancient times, of which he quoted several instances, the vast interior of Africa still remained almost a terra incognita, with its natural wealth undeveloped, and its mineral treasures unexplored. It had a climate fully equal to any other part of the world, and capable of yielding tropical and subtropical productions to any extent. Still, it was a lost continent, banished, as it were, from commercial intercourse with the civilized parts of the world. The most considerable part of our commerce with North Central Africa was carried across the Great Desert of Sahara from the shores of the Mediterranean. Caravans now performed dangerous and tedious journeys of many months' duration from Morocco, Algiers, Tripoli, Tunis, and other ports to the kingdom of Soudan. Two thousand miles of sterile and mountainous country had to be traversed and hostile tribes encountered before the nearest market was reached. In spite of those difficulties, about three millions worth of British produce found its way annually from the North to Soudan, which kingdom had no less than twenty millions of inhabitants. The great importance of opening those regions to commerce could not for a moment be doubted, and Timbuctoo formed, he thought, the most favoured spot for such intercourse, situated as it was on the very edge of the Desert. His plan was to open a direct commercial highway from the mouth of the river Belta, in the neighbourhood of Capes Juby and Bogador, on the North-west Coast of Africa, opposite the Canary Islands, to the northern bend of the Niger, at Timbuctoo—a distance of about 800 miles. That would form the shortest route to the interior, and was within easy access of Europe and America, the mouth of the Belta being distant about 1,500 miles from England. The engineering difficulties were inconsiderable, since the physical formation of that part of the Desert of Sahara which had to be crossed favoured the project; a great tract of it, with an area of 126,000 square miles, and known as Eljuf, being a vast depression, considerably below the level of the Atlantic. It was bounded by fertile and populous regions, and inhabited by an industrious class of people, whose only commercial intercourse with Europe was carried on from Mogador. That depression was impregnated with salt, and it had, it was believed, formerly formed part of the bed of the sea. He contended that the climate, the geography, and the people were all favourable to the scheme, and if once the mouth of the Belta was cleared of sand, the waters of the Atlantic would fill their former bed; thus establishing a direct communication with North Central Africa within easy distance of our ports. Instead of a trade of three millions annually, it might be increased tenfold. The great continent of Africa would be opened to every wholesome influence, its vast resources would be developed, and the horrors of the slave-trade would no longer stain its history. He added that the proposed preliminary survey would enable them to obtain the necessary data to carry out the scheme, and that such survey would be comparatively inexpensive."", 'last_edit_date': '1875-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1875#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE ""COMING"" CONTINENT.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In an article, entitled ""Africa for Africans,"" published in a magazine issued in Washington, U.S.A., the vast possibilities of progress and development possessed by this continent are so eloquently and aptly set forth that we quote the passage *in extenso*:\n\n""Africa is to-day the object of more interest on the part of a larger number of people than any other quarter of the globe.

Her Chamber of Deputies has granted the De Brazza mission, by a vote of 449 to 3, a credit of a million and a quarter of francs. The Portuguese Government has appointed explorers and examined the Congo country, and assumes to exercise control over all the territory at the mouth of the Congo. The German Reichstag has increased its annual appropriation for the exploration of Africa. Italy has despatched a party to Abyssinia for geographical and mercantile purposes. She has also concluded treaties which promise to make Assab a centre of commerce. The Sultan of Morocco has authorized Spain to take possession of Santa Cruz del Mar, and the Sultan of Zanzibar has purchased six superior steamers to constitute a regular coast service, in the interest of commerce and for the suppression of the slave-trade. The International African Association, which owes its origin to the philanthropic initiative of Leopold II., King of the Belgians, has received large subscriptions and pushed forward exploring expeditions to start and equip the line of hospitable and scientific stations which are to bound the East and West Coast, and form a civilizing girdle around Central Africa.

He said Africa was the most fertile country in the world. They had heard of the Spice Islands, but here was a spice continent. In Africa there was a great deal more produce than the people could possibly consume. As an illustration of how a trade might grow, he might mention that in 1875 the exports of India-rubber were of the value of 40,000l., in 1876 100,000l., and this year it was expected they would be 250,000l. The great difficulty was the means of communication, but all difficulties might be removed by systematic exploration, and the establishment of stations. The slave-trade was more horrid in its effects than any one who had not witnessed them could conceive. He had known whole villages destroyed, and 500 or 600 people driven into the jungle to perish of starvation or be destroyed by wild beasts, in order to procure 50 or 60 slaves. The slave-trade might be put down by opening up roads and systematic exploration, but it would require a long time to induce the people to abolish domestic slavery, which was so rooted in their habits that if a slave were freed to-day he would complain to-morrow if he were not allowed to have a slave of his own.

It is indeed a compendium. It places before us in brief but luminous sketches, and with the aid of sixteen admirable maps and some seventy illustrations, all that is publicly known about Africa and its peoples—their specific peculiarities, character, manners, customs, and condition, physical and moral; with enumeration of its varied products, its trade and commerce. It is an admirable volume for all who desire general information respecting that great continent, into the dense darkness of which the light of civilization and Christianity has begun to penetrate, through the devoted exertions of missionaries and scientific explorers. Africa does not present us with any very pleasing pictures. They are all of barbarism, and for the most part barbarism of the lowest and most disgusting type, and yet such as awakes and impels to active exertion the warmest sympathies and desires of the Christian and philanthropist. Such books as this of Mr. Stanford\'s are particularly valuable in view of the extremely limited degree of information respecting Africa possessed even by the majority of well-educated people in England. So many active agencies are now at work in and for Africa that some more intimate knowledge of it must be desired; while yet the labour of wading through long and dreary books of African travel, with their sadly monotonous succession of pictures of sparsely-inhabited countries, and of ignorance, suffering, cruelty, and moral degradation everywhere, deters most people from seeking it in their pages. This ""Compendium"" meets such desires, and gets rid of such difficulties, offering as a prize to be gained by a few leisure hours\' reading all that it is essential well-educated people should know of this great continent. The degree of knowledge thus to be obtained may lead some whose attention has not hitherto been called in that direction to desires and sympathies with regard to that long-neglected quarter of the world, and its wretched populations. We therefore hail its appearance with great pleasure, and strongly recommend ""Stanford\'s Compendium—Africa"" to our readers.

It would be little less than absurd for us at present to make extracts (with the small available space which our journal offers) from two volumes, each of between five and six hundred pages, although we purpose doing so from time to time. Our friends know that we do not praise books lightly. We praise these. Our earnest recommendation to all our readers—for they are all, of course, interested in that vast Africa which so much occupies our thoughts—our earnest recommendation is, buy these books, and read them. An African library cannot be complete without them. Dr. Schweinfurth must henceforth occupy the very highest rank among scientific African explorers. Nor is it only to our readers that we feel bound to give advice consequent on the perusal of these volumes. Dr. Schweinfurth is an almost unique African traveller, both as regards his natural and his acquired gifts. He seems to be impervious to African fever. He knows how to obtain the sympathy, respect, and friendship of the people among whom he is thrown; he possesses many qualifications which insure him a welcome everywhere; he is an acute and diligent observer, and knows thoroughly how to place before others what he himself sees, hears, reasons, and feels.

First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': ""The third category of states included geographically and culturally distant peoples such as the Dagomba, the Mamprusi and the Gonja.

In a similar vein, references have been made to the presence of Asante representatives in all types of states and also to the introduction of substantial Asante features into the Dagomba army or interventions by the Asantehene in Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes. 14 It is obvious nevertheless that the mandates of the Asante regional commissioners varied according to the situation.

The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.617, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate and Borno', 'section_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80 > Military and diplomatic activities', 'content': ""In short, the caliphate did not introduce any new strategy or military technology, nor did it possess any overwhelming advantage beyond the size of its potential resources; and these were never mobilized all at once. Guerrilla warfare, brought about by the displacement of peoples after the djihäd, by food shortages due to the dislocation of agriculture, or simply by the profits to be made from the sale of captives, plagued the caliphate for much of the century. Too much can be made of the insecurity, but at least in some areas the expectation of becoming a slave at some period in one's life was high.$^{11}$ Ransoms could be arranged, prisoners freed, a captive might even escape, but if, as often happened, the whole family or village was broken up in a raid, there was little to return to. Trade was seemingly not much affected by warfare, though certain areas might get cut off. Trading expeditions were armed, while for some traders their staple was to supply armies with horses and weapons in return for prisoners to take away and resell at some distance from their home.\nGiven the military limitations, diplomacy was an important aspect of caliphal policy.$^{12}$ The caliphs appear to have handled most of the diplomatic correspondence themselves. No state visits by the caliph took place, nor was any senior member of the caliph's staff sent on embassies overseas. Instead passing scholars, pilgrims and traders acted as bearers of messages, and brought news of political developments abroad. Correspondence was exchanged with Morocco, Tripoli and Britain, and was preserved: but no doubt much more important exchanges were conveyed orally or have been lost. But Muhammad Bello's interest in external relations was as much intellectual as commercial or political. Keen and able to keep up with developments, ideas and inventions in North Africa and the world beyond, he was concerned to bring the caliphate more fully into the metropolitan Muslim world. At the same time, with his concern for the world's approach› ing end and the possibility of having to migrate east to Mecca, he tried to ensure that the road be kept open, and appointed a distant kinsman of the Shaykh to oversee the Baghirmi section of the route."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.606, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""In theory such indirect administration also applied to French colonial activities south of the Sahara, but in fact practice was at severe variance with it. In a statement frequently referred to as most descriptive of the methods which the French actually pursued in this region between the wars, the Governor-General of French West Africa, Joost Van Vollenhoven, remarked in 1917: The chiefs 'have no power of their own, for there are not two authorities in the cercle ... ; there is only one! Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization. The egregious exception, however, was South Africa where the concept of'native authority' was the means by which the white minority assured local administration of Africans now displaced by the policy of segregation to territorial reserves."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.608, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate and Borno', 'section_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80 > Military and diplomatic activities', 'content': 'But diplomacy and warfare aside, the commonest instrument of policy in inter-state relations was economic. Military destruction of crops or grain stores was only one aspect. Particular groups, such as the Tuareg, might be refused access to markets, to certain commodities (like grain) or to wells. Given the local annual variations in rainfall, such bans could be very effective. Less effective were embargoes on the export or import of items such as horses, weapons, salt or types of cloth, while an indiscriminate blockade of towns or areas was difficult to sustain, not least because smuggling offered high profits. But the disruption in the normal flow of caliphal trade caused for example by Ningi and Mbutawa raids was serious enough to require a remedy. Indeed their own experience of severe food shortages and the interruption of the grain trade during the djifiàd had made men like Muhammad Bello acutely aware of the importance of encouraging traders by keeping roads open, establishing markets and enforcing the laws regulating fair trading. In consequence, as the caliphal economy became relatively more efficient and neighbouring peoples depended more heavily on caliphal trade and traders, economic policy was increasingly a more effective instrument of power than warfare.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 170, 'article_title': 'The Merits of the Ashantee War', 'full_section_title': 'The Merits of the Ashantee War', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1863#article-3', 'issue_date': '23_06_1863', 'content': 'Under the above title, we have received the following from a most esteemed correspondent on the West Coast. It is valuable for history of the war, because it seems to show both sides of the question with great impartiality:—\n\n""The ostensible cause of the war is the detention by the British authorities of the runaway captain and eight men from Ashantee, who took refuge in the protected territory. The King of Ashantee was determined to have this man given up to him; but the conditions required by his Excellency Governor Pine, which were just and humane, the King of Ashantee was unable to comply with. Viewing the case impartially, one is led to conclude that both parties are justified in what they have done—the Governor for protecting the man, and the King for declaring war by crossing the Prah, the boundary of the respective territories.\n\n""The Governor is perfectly justified, because, according to the British law, a refugee who cannot be proved to have committed any crime, and who claims protection from our Government, cannot legally be delivered up to a tyrant or a despotic Government, where will is arbitrary in actions. It is well known that the life of these men, if they had been delivered up, would have been sacrificed. No sooner would they have crossed the frontier, than their heads would have been taken off and sent to the King of Ashantee at Comassie. No mercy would be shown to them, and no promise of sparing their lives that might be made to the Governor would be worthy of the least consideration.\n\n""The King is right in declaring war, because—\n\n""Firstly, the very throne on which he sits is at stake. Should he not have acted promptly in this affair, his people would have branded him as a coward unworthy to occupy the stool of the long-famed and brave Kings of Ashantee.\n\n""Secondly, should he have allowed the refugees to remain quietly with us, without making any demonstration regarding them, more important men would also have soon crossed from his territory to seek protection and security under the quiet rule of our Government. It behoved the King, therefore, to show that they could not do this with impunity.\n\n""Thirdly, the peaceful traders of the King of Ashantee had, before there was any commencement of war by him, been molested by the Fantees, their goods seized, and the men themselves put in irons. They were only released by order of Governor Pine, and no compensation was given to them.\n\n""Fourthly, the King of Ashantee\'s generals and captains will, on such an occasion, swear the great oath—viz., that the King has received an unpardonable insult, and that they are determined to avenge it.

He has heard that they are preparing to make another attack upon that town again. That the moment they move against Elmina he would march down his troops, with a drawn sword in his own hands, and drive the Denkerahs and Fantees into the sea. These messengers proceeded further to state that the King upon two occasions sent his traders to Mr. Blankson, of Anamaboe, to purchase some silks and other goods. The Assins wantonly seized the whole of the gold and detained the men, and up to this day he has not seen a vestige of any of them, and was very much surprised indeed to hear that one of his court criers, amongst the lost messengers, had hung himself, and why not all the messengers hung themselves the same way?\n\nThat the kings of Denkerah in former days did receive stipends from the Dutch Government, that Quaskie Fram, the present King of Denkerah, knows very well that these kings have been beaten down and routed by him, and after they had been subdued by the great King of Ashantee and his successors, the stipends that they did receive from the Dutch Government recoiled to him. That the King of Denkerah knows that the same power which subdued and ruled his ancestors is still in existence, and how dared he to attempt to stop the path by which he sends to receive his stipend (annual), and to stop his people from trading as to preventing him from getting access to the place where he eats his salt, drinks his, &c.\n\n2. That if the Fantees and Assins do not return to him the seizure they made of 200 ounces of gold and sixty men that they had detained and plundered within thirty days from the day they arrived here, he, the King, determined to rise from his stool and take his revenge upon them, and drive them into the sea. In conclusion, the King, to show that he was in earnest in what he has said, swore upon all that was sacred to him (then he named different oaths they have in Coomassie).

These date actually from 1870, when negotiations were pending for the transference of the Dutch possessions on the Gold Coast to the British. The King of Ashanti, Koffe Kalkalli, wrote, objecting to the transfer of Elmina, for which, he alleged, tribute had been paid to his ancestors. The agent of the Dutch Government repudiated the claim as ""entirely without foundation,"" but the British representatives refused to proceed further until the Dutch put their title beyond dispute. This having been done, the Treaty was concluded, and the ratifications exchanged in Feb. 1872. In April 1872 the Dutch Commodore wrote to the King, informing him of what had taken place, and requesting him to hand over to the English certain missionaries he held captive in his country. Mr. Pope Hennessy, the Governor, also communicated with the King, telling him that out of the friendship he had for him and his people he had ordered all the trading communications with Ashanti to be opened, and offered to pay double the sum received annually from the Dutch. A long correspondence ensued with regard to the missionaries, for whom a ransom was demanded. While the negotiations were progressing the King was secretly preparing for war, and, on Jan. 22, 1873, a large Ashanti army crossed the Prah and invaded the British Protectorate. The whole of the available Houssa Police were hastily mobilised, and arrangements made for the issue of arms and ammunition to the Fanti Kings. But the tribes could not be brought into line. They were most discouraging material of which to form an army. The Governor urged upon them the necessity for co-operation, as there could be no doubt that all their efforts would be required to arrest the progress of the hordes of the enemy which were at their gates. Reinforcements of troops were drawn from Sierra Leone; but their numbers were but small. Meanwhile the people were in a most distressing state of panic. At last the allied tribes, finding the Ashanti legions upon them, were induced to show fight, and eventually succeeded in holding the foe in check, but nothing could persuade them to follow up their success by an attack. Gaining courage by this the Ashantees moved forward and struck a blow at the Fanti camp. The Fantees managed to hold their own, and the Ashantees achieved no advantage. The cowardice of the allied tribes is almost incomprehensible. In two battles they had not sustained a defeat; if anything the fortunes of the day were in their favour; yet in a few days, they were in full retreat to the Coast. The break-up of the Fanti Army caused the utmost consternation at Cape Coast. The Administrator ordered that a gunboat should be sent to Elmina, as that fort was the principal settlement in the territory they were anxious to repossess, and the loss of which they had never been able to forget. The Ashantees, however, contented themselves by concentrating at a central camp at Dunquah, where they remained until the middle of May. The efforts to reorganise the Fanti tribes proved unsuccessful, and the home Government decided upon despatching such an expedition as would once and for all establish the sovereignty of the British on the Coast. Sir Garnet Wolseley was sent for, and he advised the despatch of an European force, but the Government were unwilling to launch British troops without previous inquiry into a country which was sometimes called ""the white man\'s grave."" On June 9, a body of Marines, under Colonel Festing, was landed. This officer at once assumed command of the Forces, and, collecting all the available material, he advanced upon Ashanti camp and succeeded in driving the army over the Prah, with which he contented himself pending the arrival of fresh troops. The passages of the river were held, and every move of the enemy noted. By this time Sir Garnet had been despatched from England to Cape Coast Castle, constituted Commander of the Forces and Administrator of the Gold Coast. On his arrival he was more than ever convinced that European troops would be the best with which to undertake the mission he was charged with, and the troops he had asked for were sent out. This force, which consisted of three battalions of Infantry with some Royal Engineers and Royal Artillery and Administrative Services, were landed at Cape Coast Castle on Jan. 1, 1874, and on Feb. 4 arrived at Coomassie, having fought several battles on the way, and literally cut a passage through the dense brush and jungle. In addition there were two Native regiments which did excellent service, as also the Marines, Houssas, and West Indians. The Native levies that were raised by Captain Glover, R.N., on the Eastern side of the Protectorate proved quite unreliable. The greatest difficulties of the campaign arose from the almost complete lack of information that existed of the nature or topography of the country and although twenty-one years have since elapsed, but little has been added to the knowledge gained during the progress to Coomassie and the return to the Coast.'}, {'id': 6698, 'article_title': 'THE ASHANTI EXPEDITION.', 'full_section_title': 'THE ASHANTI EXPEDITION.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_02_1896#article-1', 'issue_date': '03_02_1896', 'content': ""The fighting column left the encampment on the banks of the river Adra at 6 o'clock on Jan. 17, and entered the capital without opposition.

We have for the last three months been anticipating what, to all intents and purposes, will prove a reality—viz., a war with the King of Ashantee. In November last, one of the captains of the King being ordered up to Comasie, on a charge of robbing what is regarded as the King's quota of gold, and being apprehensive that the issue would cost his head, escaped with eighty adherents from the kingdom of Ashantee to the coast, and claimed protection from the English Government. The King immediately sent one of his principal chieftains, with a number of sword-bearers, to request that the captain and his men should be given up. On his arrival at Cape Coast Castle a grand palaver was held, in which were present the Governor and Council, the principal merchants at Cape Coast and its vicinity, the chiefs and head men of Cape Coast, the runaway chief, as well as the King's messengers. After a long palaver, the last were unable to substantiate the charges against the man, who swore that he would rather have his head cut off before the fort gate than that he should be sent up to Comasie. After long deliberation it was unanimously agreed that the captain and his followers were not to be delivered up until the King should send down witnesses to corroborate the charges alleged against him. The King demanded that the men should be delivered up unconditionally; or, if not, the Governor must stand the consequence. During this time it was noticed that Ashantees, who came down as peaceful traders, bought almost wholly guns, powder, and lead bar, articles which are decidedly munitions of war. The chiefs in the interior got alarmed at this, and seized the articles as the men passed along their territory. Intelligence of this reached Comasie, and from that time the King gave orders to his captains to make preparations for an invasion. In the meantime the King sent to inform the Governor that he had broken the treaty with his Government, and that he (the King) was going to send down one of his captains, who was then in the interior, to show the Governor the treaty. The Governor promised, whenever that should be done, to deliver the captain up, and even escort him to the frontiers of the King of Ashantee with British soldiers. The next information that reached the coast was that a large Ashantee army had crossed the river Prah (the boundary line between the protectorate territory and the kingdom of his Majesty King Quaku Duah) towards the eastern district, and that the King of Akim had fallen back before them to get the support of the tribes on the seashore. A few days afterwards another army crossed the Prah at Assin, in a direct road to Anamaboe and Cape Coast. Most of the men on the seacoast who are able to bear arms have left for the Fantee camp, at the neighbourhood of Assin, where at least about 14,000 men are at present, waiting the movements of the Ashantees. Scouts have been sent out, and some Ashantee heads have been sent down, to corroborate the report that the Ashantees have invaded the Fantee territory. The report is just now current that pickets of the army of Ajeman, King of Western Akim, met an Ashantee pillaging band, fired at them, and wounded their leader, who was brought before the King as a prisoner. He begged hard for his life, and promised to reveal everything about the war. He was made to swear by his King's stool that all that he was about to say were facts. The information he gave was the following: The King, on hearing that the Governor refused to deliver up the men, turned out all the available force, numbering about 60,000 men. Of these, 20,000 were to form a corps of observation on the eastern district, by descending on Akim, and thus preventing the Accras, Aquamhus, and Akims from joining the Fantees, and the remaining 40,000 were to descend upon the Fantees through Assin, sweeping everything before them, until they arrive at Cape Coast and Anamaboe, both of which places they intend to sack; the victorious were then to march against the Accras.

It had, indeed, under the new aspect of affairs in the protected territories, consequent upon the late Ashantee war, the recommendations of the Parliamentary Committee and the resolves of the Colonial-office, become an _absolute duty_ on the part of Great Britain to arrive at such an understanding with the King of Ashantee as should serve to place the relations between Ashantee and the kingdoms and tribes in the protectorate on the same footing as they were before the war. England having determined that she would not in future take part in any campaign against the Ashantees further than by affording some advice, arms, and ammunition to the Fantees and other tribes of the protectorate who might be involved in war with that people, it became indispensable to put an end to all existing causes of quarrel, which might otherwise afford a reason or a pretext for a new invasion. During the last year of the late war, the natives in the protectorate maintained on all occasions that it was not a war between them and Ashantee, but was a white man\'s palaver—a dispute between the King of Ashantee and the Governor of Cape Coast, through whom they were involved in it. We presume that it is on this ground the present administration at Cape Coast, in endeavoring to bring about pacific relations with Ashantee has thought it right and proper to conduct the negotiations without making the kings and chiefs parties to them. The proceedings have, therefore, we suppose, been, as our correspondent states, ""shrouded in mystery;"" and it appears the peace negotiations have been more protracted than the chief authorities at Cape Coast Castle had anticipated. Since we made the publication above alluded to, accompanied with a copy of the official proclamation, messengers and messages have passed and repassed between Cape Coast and Comassie, the latest messenger who lately made his appearance on the coast having with him a retinue of 100 men. What could this mean? Colonel Conran was so secret in his words and resolves that not the smallest suspicion of the real state of affairs seems to have been entertained. Suddenly, however, one ""Gaynin"" was arrested and secured, and it was made known that he was to be sent off to Sierra Leone by the next mail steamer, which was subsequently effected. At Sierra Leone he was to be allowed 1s. 9d. per diem for subsistence. This ""Gaynin"" was the chief alleged cause of the Ashantee invasion. He was a subject of the King of Ashantee, accused of having appropriated to his own use a lump of gold, all lump gold belonging of right to the King. Summoned to Comassie to give an account of this, he believed his life to be in danger, and sought refuge at Cape Coast. The King of Ashantee demanded him; the Governor refused to give him up; other grievances raised their heads; and the war ensued so big with results for the protectorate. From what has now occurred, it appears that the King of Ashantee, with the obstinacy which characterises the sovereigns of that country, has continued to urge the surrender of ""Gaynin"" as the absolutely indispensable condition of peace relations. This has, no doubt, led to the proposal by the Administrator of a medium course, namely—that he should be sent away from Cape Coast, his presence there being offensive to his late sovereign. We presume, further, that this more moderate course has been acceptable to his Majesty of Ashantee, and think it extremely probable that, as our correspondents suggest, the envoy with his escort of 100 came to Cape Coast that he might assure his master of the fact of ""Gaynin"" having been embarked for Sierra Leone.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1866#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Pretensions and Threats of Ashantee', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—You will perhaps be surprised to hear of the most insulting message which the King of Ashantee has sent to the Fantee kings, through Mr. Simpson, the Acting Administrator.

The telegrams have led many to believe that the Ashantees were within three days\' march of Cape Coast Castle, and that the colony was in imminent danger. It has also been stated that the gold mining districts were likely to be the first invaded. We have agents at all the principal places, and, as we receive the most reliable information, we think it right to assure the public through you that we consider that there is not at present any serious cause for alarm. When the Lieutenant-Governor refused to give up the fugitive, he was informed by the King\'s messenger that he must take the consequences. We hardly think it follows that because the gold axe was sent an invasion of the colony was intended. The Ashantees have enough to do to hold their own, and should they leave their country it would probably be overrun by other tribes. The force that can be brought into the field against us has been grossly exaggerated. It has been computed at 90,000 men, and the same informant states that the King has been recruiting on a large scale to obtain this force. All those acquainted with the Gold Coast are aware that there is no recruiting in the Ashantee kingdom. The King is a despot, and when he makes war every able-bodied man has\n\nabandon peaceful pursuits and join the undisciplined army. We are advised that the Ashantees desire in the first instance to crush the Adansees, who occupy the country immediately beyond our frontier at Prahsue.

Sir Samuel Rowe having had experience in those countries, having been at Coomassie with Sir John Glover, and shared, no doubt, with Sir John the disgust of not being allowed to remain there awhile and place the affairs of the countries beyond the Prah on a permanent peace footing, he knows the people with whom he has to deal, and has no more fear of an Ashantee than of any other untutored savage. Such a man, we hope, will see the necessity of something more than to be content that no invasion has taken place, or that it has been repulsed. It is not compatible with the dignity of the British Government, or with the duty of the latter to the countries under its protection, that the latter should remain liable to a repetition of the “Golden Axe” insult whenever it may suit a vain and ignorant barbarian to inflict it. Sir Samuel Rowe will, we hope, recognize the necessity, and make that necessity to be fully comprehended in Downing-street, that a definite line of policy must be adopted, and certain efficient measures be taken and maintained, as regards Ashanti and the other native States beyond the River Prah such as shall put an end for ever to the possibility of the recurrence of insulting threats, with their disturbing influence on industrial pursuits in the countries of the protectorate, and needless expense both to the Imperial and Colonial Exchequer. To give security to a country as well as to preserve peace and order in it, is one of the first duties of a sovereign power. This security the British Government must now give to the Fantee countries. We have made them dependent on us for protection, and we must make that protection efficient—not spasmodic, according to the varying humour of an insolent neighbouring barbarian, but constant and assured beyond the possibility of doubt. If it be said that the British Parliament, uninstructed by the fate of Old Rome, would not consent to any charge on the British Exchequer for any requisite measurer, then we say that the revenues of the protected territories, now not less than 100,000l. a year, are adequate for securing the interest on a public loan for the small amount that would be required. We have before contended that this revenue should be made available for guaranteeing railroads, and for other works of public improvement, that may aid in the development of the natural resources, vegetable and mineral, of those territories; but though we have the construction of railways there deeply at heart, we would postpone these and all other aids to industry in favour of that one great first aid without which all others are liable to fail in their object—security, perfect security, for life and property against the threat of barbarian invasion. We venture to hope that Sir Samuel Rowe will be the instrument through whom this great aid will be obtained. For ages past Ashanti has been the curse of all neighbouring countries. It was delivered into our hands in 1873-4 for destruction, and we failed in our duty, allowed it to be revived, and again to become insolent, and are now suffering the temporary disturbance of important industries, and compelled to incur considerable expense, because of that insolence.

The order speaks encouragingly of the climate of the interior, and assures the men that the operations beyond the Prah will last only a few weeks. It concludes as follows: ""When once a position has been gained, it is to be held resolutely. In warfare of this nature, there must be no retreats. No village or camp is to be set on fire except by order of the major-general commanding; officers and men are reminded of the danger and delay which occur if a village is set on fire before all the ammunition and baggage have made their way through it. All plundering and unnecessary destruction of property are to be strictly repressed; officers are to be strictly responsible that, when a village or camp is occupied, their men are kept together, and prevented from dispersing to seek plunder. The importance of kindness from all ranks to the friendly natives, who are employed as carriers, is strongly urged: if the carriers are ill-treated, the troops run imminent risk of being left without food and ammunition. It must never be forgotten by the soldiers that Providence has implanted in the heart of every native of Africa a superstitious awe and dread of the white man, that prevents the negro from daring to meet him face to face in combat. A steady advance or a charge, no matter how partial, if made with determination, always means the retreat of the enemy. Although, when at a distance, and even when under a heavy fire, the Ashantees seem brave enough, from their practice of yelling and singing and beating drums in order to frighten the enemies of their own colour with whom they are accustomed to make war, they will not stand against the advance of the white man. English soldiers and sailors are accustomed to fight against immense odds in all parts of the world. It is scarcely necessary to remind them that when in our battles beyond the Prah they find themselves surrounded on all sides by hordes of howling enemies, they must rely upon their old British courage and discipline, and upon the courage of their comrades.

The reputation and resources of Tuskegee, however, were brought to Africa by African and American alumni and, often, by numerous African visitors to Tuskegee or correspondents with Washington who had never been matriculated students. Consequently, through the media of numerous international conferences, visitations, and technical missions, many Africans were touched by the 'Tuskegee Spirit' or drew upon Tuskegee's and other American black resources."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.726, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in Central and Southern Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'Conclusion', 'content': 'To sum up, the Africans of the countries of Southern and Central Africa stood up to colonialism and made a substantial contribution to the preparation of the liberation movement on the African continent which followed after 1935.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.763, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Emergence of the Western-educated elite', 'content': 'The greatest social impact of the missionary revolution, however, was the emergence of an educated elite in Africa.

That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence. The interests of these settlers clashed with those of the Africans and they used their influence with the colonial administration to obstruct or stultify African development."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.723, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'The spread of Christianity, Islam and western education was another important impact of colonialism. There is no doubt that taking advantage of the peace and order as well as the patronage and in some areas the positive encouragement provided by colonialism, Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics pushed their activities further and further inland. As K. Asare Opoku has shown (Chapter 20), Christianity and Islam gained far more ground during the colonial period than had been the case during the previous three or four centuries put together. It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony. It is signifi› cant that except in North Africa, Tanzania, Kenya and Madagascar, these languages have remained the official languages even to this very day.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading. One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

These have remained in many areas and underlie some of the civil wars and rivalries that have occurred in some independent African states. The neglect of higher education and technical training also compelled some Africans who could afford to do so, to send their children to the metropolitan countries as well as to the United States, and it was such people who, partly from their varying experiences of racial discrimination and, even more important still, their deeper appreciation of the evil nature of the colonial system, became on their return, as will be shown in the next volume, the most bitter critics of the system and the leaders of the anti-colonial or nationalist movements.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': 'Nor is the \'traditional-modern\' polar model, with all its attendant implications of conflict and incompatibility, applicable to the entire spectrum of African experience of change under colonialism. There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure.

If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The significance of colonialism for Africa', 'content': ""Finally, in the social field, the significance of colonialism here is clearly a mixed one.

Already, two new groups have been added since independence. One is the political elite made up of the leading members of the political parties that have been mushrooming in Africa and who have become the prime ministers, presidents, ministers, ambassadors, etc. The other is the military elite made up of present and ex-officers of the armed forces of each independent state. The members of these elite groups are definitely different from the people of the rural areas in terms of their dress, life style, tastes and status. Now, had these elite groups constituted a good percentage of the population of Africa, one would have accepted their formation as yet another crucial and fundamental change introduced by colonialism. But as indicated already, the urban or elitist groups constituted by the end of the colonial era only a small fraction of the population, at most about 20%. The remaining people were the rural dwellers who remained predominantly illiterate and maintained their traditional beliefs, values and standards. Indeed, such civilization or socialization that colonial› ism introduced was essentially an urban phenomenon, and did not really affect the rural people, and, since the latter constitute the overwhelming majority of the population of every African state, we can safely and reason› ably conclude that the colonial impact here, interesting as it is, was extremely limited."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Conclusions', 'content': ""What were the effects of colonial African and American black interaction?

Exactly how much is anybody's guess. The effect of colonial African experience with American blacks appears, nevertheless, unique and vital in terms of subsequent social and political activities. For some, the American black component within African nationalist ideology and strategies emerging during the colonial period was striking and unequivocal. In the view of others, for example some African students, interactions within American black arenas were disappointing and unrewarding. The caustic assessment of one such visitor illustrates the latter point: 'One of the things I had decided to find out during my stay in America was the condition of the descendants of former slaves brought here from Africa ... I feel safe in saying that, so far as economic and material progress are concerned the Negro in America is on the average ahead of the West African, but when it comes to integrity and genuine manhood, the American Negro is far below him.' 75 Another view was that many Afro-American missionaries who viewed Africans as 'poor heathen savages' must bear some of the responsibility for perpetuating a distorted and pernicious picture of Africa and Africans in the minds of their fellow American blacks. In other words, in their sedulous campaign to recruit American black workers for foreign missions, missionary churches undoubtedly succumbed occasionally to the tempta- tion of portraying an exotic, erotic and socially inferior Africa much in need of great sacrifice, hard work, and alien redemption."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Finally, what is the record of colonialism in the social field?

Caldwell has shown (Chapter 18), after its decline during the first two or three decades of colonialism. This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization.

To distant people, we form one of the most intelligent and civilized portions of Africa, who, although not under a European Government, are enjoying as much of their influence as if we were born civilized. But to have a proper knowledge of the cotton tree, it is necessary to approach it more closely, when it will be discovered that it is full of thorns. This is the only way I can contrast what our country is with what it is considered to be. Our country is, undoubtedly, a great port for the palm-oil trade; and it appears to me that the only influence existing is that of raking and draining it of every speck of oil that could be got—and nothing more. Sordid avarice and insatiable gain is their only and chief aim. We own that we are poor, ignorant, heathen people, and, perhaps, vile savages too, as we are often styled; but we cannot feel more happy than when we have Europeans among us, whose goodness we feel proud to copy and imitate. I do not think that the days of contraband, when man formed the chief article of trade among us, were worse than ours—the period when lawful commerce takes the lead, and the Christian religion regulates its progress. Trade, from the way it is carried on, has a rather debasing effect on us; religion, from the stingy manner it is introduced and its principles engrafted, tends to steep us in a twofold ignorance, almost as dark as that in which it found us; so that the only improvement resulting from the advantage both of commerce and religion among us, at present, is a low cunning and a doggish reverence. People whose ears are accustomed to hear the fair carol of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in our country through European influence and missionary efforts, might be constrained to denounce my observations as a slander: but if they know the truly meaning of multum in parvo, and how it is unscrupulously practised by their agents abroad, I need not labour to convince them. I do not ignore the fact that faithful workers have from time to time been sent to our country, and that, through them, we should have been better; but the thing is this, those already in the field informed them, ""When you go to Rome, do what Rome does."" The merchant, whose only ambition is to hoard up all he could rake from the negro\'s hide, grins with pleasure and satisfaction at his wretchedness, contrives new methods of aggravating humanity, and uses all his subtle skill in advocating, if possible, the total extinction of the vague, glimmering twilight that shines around us; and the missionary, as a rule, teaches the black man hardly anything beyond the Bible, transcribed in his own tongue. In one of their conferences, held at Gaboon, the missionaries have decided not to give us and our children any intellectual training. We keenly feel the result of such selfishness, not only for ourselves, but for our children and children\'s children. How painful it is to think that there is not a single youth in our country who is capable of being more than a menial servant in any of the European establishments here! Why is it so different at Bonny, at New Calabar, at Brass, and throughout the Niger territory? It is thirty-six years ago now since a mission was planted in our midst; yet we do not present a brighter aspect than that of a dilapidated and neglected plantation. There is nothing of civilizing industry introduced into the country whereby to profit our youths; whereas in the Niger Mission—which is working exclusively by native agency, headed by its Bishop, and a grand train of clerical and lay assistants—industrial training is incorporated with the work. To every mission-station in the Niger is appended a first-class boarding-school, the pupils of which are fit to teach the teachers whom the Mission here laboured so arduously to produce. The Niger is able to furnish herself with a good staff of able and competent artisans, interpreters, clerks, and teachers; and is getting up a theological institution to train their own men. But here no such things are studied, although I am sure of their meeting the ready approval of our benefactors in Britain.'}]","[{'document_title': 'West Coast Government', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'portance, the presence of a continually increasing number of African girls educated in some of the best schools in England.

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs. It shows nice powers of observation—great diligence—a clear appreciation of facts, and a mental daring that does not shrink from the great problems of the future of the various divisions of his race, on which the light of Christian civilisation is only now beginning to shine, and who are for the most part placed under circumstances most unfavourable to its increase. After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries. Showing us their actual condition, and exposing many errors of administration which are opposed to material development and social advancement, he views the whole in connexion with the resolutions of the late House of Commons Committee, 1865, recommending the preparing of the several people for self-government. He shows the great changes that must be induced and fostered to make such self-government possible, safe, or beneficial. Though he has evidently a deep and, we believe, a just faith in his race, he does not shut his eyes to any of the disadvantages of their actual position and the difficulties in the way of their progress toward Christianity, civilisation, and wealth. The book ought to be read and studied by all educated Africans, and we should like to see it have a large circulation in England, as we consider it calculated to arouse sympathies for Africa where they have never yet been felt, and to give them a vigorous impulse where they do already exist.

The lively interest and heartfelt sympathy you have always manifested in the work of Africa\'s regeneration and advancement seems ever to be increasing with the onward march of time, and it is to be hoped that such zealous and benevolent efforts will be crowned with abundant success.\n\nYour remarks on the subject of Education in your last two issues, and the convincing arguments you advanced to recommend the subject to the notice of the ""higher powers,"" have been read by not a few here with feelings of deep gratitude and satisfaction. It is greatly to be hoped that such an earnest appeal will not be suffered to pass by unheard. It is gratifying to state that the Accra Church of England High-class School has been fairly established and set in proper working order, and since its establishment the number of its pupils has been steadily on the increase. If, as stated in my previous correspondence, such a school as the High-class School be amply and efficiently supported, it will prove a great boon to the place. That the educational work that is thus being inaugurated here needs such support as you have pleaded for will be evident from the fact that it has not been undertaken by the Church Missionary Society, as your remarks would seem to indicate, but by the sole efforts of some of the native residents of this place, who, sensible of the great educational wants of the community, have requested the Bishop of Sierra Leone to aid them in the establishment here of the Church of England with a properly-organized school; and the kind-hearted prelate, ever ready to lend a helping hand to every very good work, promised to aid their efforts in the undertaking. From this it will be seen that such needful help as you have advocated is a *sine qua non* in the proper development of education in this place; and should it be afforded, an efficient staff of competent teachers will be secured, and high-class schools, grammar schools, collegiate schools, and other seminaries of learning will be established along this Coast, which will undoubtedly be productive of unspeakable benefit to the country at large. This, Mr. Editor, in my humble opinion, will be the only panacea for the effectual eradication of the moral, social, and intellectual evil under which ""the land is groaning.""\n\nThe hope of this country\'s elevation seems to me to be in the rising and future generations, in the proper development of their intellectual faculties, and the instilment into their minds of the ""sweets"" of education.

We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Roll of African Worthies', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Our heart swells with exultation whenever we are able to point to a name to be inscribed on the historical roll of African worthies.

We refer our readers again to his letter on this very important point, because we feel that as the past has depended, so the future must in no small degree depend, on this of late most calumniated body of men. Whatever may be the other measures adopted for the advancement of Africa, any relaxation of the efforts of missionaries would be a result deeply to be deplored by every one who is looking and labouring for the day of African regeneration. Mr. Rosenbush\'s views so intimately coincide with our own as to the means by which ""improvement and civilization"" may be best advanced in the colony of Sierra Leone, that we may be excused again entering largely upon them at this time. The agricultural improvement of the colony demands the special attention of Government authorities; and when, as in this case, a means is pointed out which only requires a better disposal of the revenues raised in the colony itself, by making them instrumental in obtaining reproductive results from the enforced labour of the criminal portion of the population, instead of that labour being wasted, as at present, no trivial objections or inapplicable theories ought to be allowed to stand in the way of its adoption.

In former times sufficient attention was not always given by the authorities to the suitability of candidates for employment in the minor posts in these then much despised West African possessions. But all this has greatly changed. The growing importance of the West African trade, and the general éclaircissement which followed the operations of the Ashanti War, have brought about a different spirit in the administration of these colonies, and the present colonial service in West Africa is not inferior to any other branch of the service in other parts of the world, and of late has furnished a considerable proportion of remarkable men who have distinguished themselves on the West Coast of Africa, and have been raised to posts of great influence and distinction elsewhere. I think, however, that decidedly more might be done to encourage such work as I have referred to in Lagos, namely, a thorough and scientific examination of the natural history and ethnology of these lands, so that we can be better guided in our administration of them, both by increasing our knowledge of their natural resources and by becoming more acquainted with the character of the races whom we are to rule. Especially should the learning of native languages be fostered among colonial officers. This movement has been already begun on the Gold Coast by Sir Brandford Griffith, and in Lagos by Captain Moloney, but I do not think any official steps have been taken in the matter. In nearly all the great divisions of Africa there is some lingua Franca—some widespread language of general use among native traders, or the ruling caste, which would be understood everywhere, from Benin to Old Calabar, and up the Niger to its confluence with the Benue; the Yoruba tongue, which is prevalent throughout Logos colony and right away to the kingdom of Nupe; the Hausa language, which is a good deal spoken in the Gold Coast colony, and which is one of the leading tongues of the Niger basin; the Mandingo, which is widely spread as a commercial language over the Sierra Leone colony; and the Wolof, which is much spoken on the Gambia. In the learning of each one of these languages in their respective spheres of influence colonial officers should be encouraged by small bounties or some palpable reward. These languages are simple in construction, and are illustrated by grammars and dictionaries published by the various missionary societies.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE FUTURE OF THE BRITISH WEST AFRICAN SETTLEMENTS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Such being the feeling in Great Britain with regard to our colonies generally, Africa is not likely to be made an exception.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization? The Bible contains as good a code for the improvement of mind and manners as any book extant.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-16', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ENGLAND AND HER WEST AFRICAN COLONIES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Macaulay prefaced his remarks on ""England and her West African Colonies"" by stating that he hoped to be able to prove, in the course of his essay, the success attendant upon the ecclesiastical, political, and commercial efforts of British enterprise in the West African Colonies of England, and to picture their early history with the stubborn realities existing at the present time. Although not the first among European nations to plant colonies beyond Europe, England had acquired a more extensive dominion of colonies and dependencies than any other nation in the world. She undertook the colonisation of West Africa, not by any means for renown or direct commercial advantage, but entirely with the magnanimous and philanthropic object of the salvation of the sons of Africa, both temporally and spiritually. The Colonies on the West Coast of Africa were annexed to Great Britain, first, for the suppression of that abominable traffic, the slave trade, and, secondly, for the free propagation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The colonial dependencies of Great Britain on the West Coast of Africa, which formed a portion of the 7,500,000 square miles of the British Empire, included Sierra Leone or the West Africa Settlements, the River Gambia, the Gold Coast Colony and the Slave Coast—now Lagos Colony—a total area of some 40,000 square miles. The lecturer briefly described the geographical position and features of each settlement, and then gave an interesting account of the circumstances under which Sierra Leone, the oldest colony in West Africa, became a British settlement, an episode with which those who have studied history are generally familiar. This colony eventually became peopled, and a foundation was laid for the labours of the Church Missionary Society and other Christian bodies in the year 1791. In the year 1799 a few Englishmen established in London ""The Society for Mission to Africa and the East,"" up to which time the Church of England had done nothing to spread Christianity among the heathen. In 1812 this name was changed to ""The Church Missionary Society for Africa and the East."" The first missionaries were sent to West Africa, because it had ever been, and it was then, the chief theatre of the inhuman slave trade. The great difficulty was to get missionaries, owing to the fatality of the climate to Europeans, the trying difficulties and experiences of the work, and the prevalent but erroneous idea that all efforts to raise the blacks in the social scale must prove fruitless. Ultimately two German missionaries were prevailed upon to enter upon the great and good work, and others subsequently followed from England, and ever since had been from time to time reinforced. In the first month of 1814 the foundation stone of the first Christian Church in Africa was laid at Bassia, and the committee of the above-mentioned society, now co-operating with the British & Foreign Society, were deeply engaged in carrying out the plan of redeeming as many African children as possible from slavery and attaching them to the missionary settlements. Having gone through the early history of the Church on the West Coast of Africa, the lecturer proceeded to detail a few facts to prove the glorious results of the labours of the religious societies in co-operation with the foundation laid by the goodwill and philanthropic energies of many noble-hearted men, whose efforts and constant ambition were devoted to the abolition of slavery and the slave trade. Amongst many results were the most perfect freedom of the meanest subject; the existence, all over the coast line, of peace and tranquillity as set against the unending civil wars and riots that marked the period of slavery; the ecclesiastical establishment of the West African settlements, and the profuse circulation of the Bible throughout the Colonies.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In all the coast region between the Gambia and the Cameroons the most extravagant development of tropical vegetation is seen. The great future wealth of the interior plateaux will certainly lie in their mineral deposits, the riches of the West Coast region lie in its numerous and valuable vegetable products, of which the most striking are palm oil, and ground nuts, benniseed, shea butter, rubber, gums, spices, cotton, dyes, and valuable timbers, among which ebony occupies a prominent place. With regard to animal products, I might mention ivory and monkey skins. Whereas some of the great races of the interior speak languages which connect them with the Hamitic and Semitic families. The native inhabitants of the West Coast are all that there is of most typically Negro in character; yet I do not mean they are races of particularly low development; on the contrary, the typical Negro is a fine specimen of man, and is by no means as low in his mental state as the races of Polynesia and America. I may cite the Kru tribes of that portion of West Africa which is known as Liberia, a country inhabited by an industrious, energetic, hardworking, stalwart population of free men. An element of heterogeneous ex-slave settlers among the tribes of the coast may be found in some parts of the Colonies of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos. These people represent the Nemesis which invariably follows national crimes. We and our American children indulged to a greater extent than any other European nation in the African slave trade, and, as our wrong-doing was violent and exaggerated, so to a certain extent was the abrupt reparation which followed. Although I would not minimise the work done by our blockade on the West Coast, the abolition of the slave trade was more effectually brought about by the abolition of slavery in the United States of America. One result of our suppression of the slave trade in West Africa has not been altogether advantageous. I refer to the Slave Colonies established at Sierra Leone, and at Fernando Po and other points on the coast. It may be taken that the slaves exported from any district are the least worthy people in it, and the result is that a large proportion of this population is descended from the sweepings of West Africa, and has not yet passed through sufficient generations to eliminate the ancestral badness of its progenitors. So, although here and there a negro has shown what the race can attain to under favourable circumstances, still the bulk of the ""S\'a Leone"" people who are scattered up and down the coast are of an undesirable character, and the cause of indiscriminating blame on the part of superficial observers which is most unjustly laid on the shoulders of the entire population of West Africa; whereas many of these races are superior in intelligence, enterprise, and integrity to any of our negro fellow-subjects in South Africa or the West Indies. What admirable recruits to civilised society can be obtained from many of these people may be instanced by such men as Bishop Crowther, Archdeacons Johnson and Crowther, Samuel Lewis, and other divines and lawyers and officials in West Africa, who are on a par with well-educated white men, and in some cases superior in intelligence and acquirements to the whites with whom they come in contact. It is absurd, however, to regard the Negro race, as a whole, on the same average level as the European—they are far below us. Take them in their native wilds, and they are what we were before Julius Caesar landed in this country; indeed, in many cases they are not 2,000 years behind us, but 10,000. They are in the condition of some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and Gaul, and Spain, whose history we can dimly spell out from their implements and scattered remains, who were undoubtedly cannibals and probably naked, and leading a brutish life. Yet we can in a few years drag them from the condition that prevailed 2,000 years before Christ into the year of grace 1889. We can take a cannibal from the Upper Cross River, and transport him to the centres of civilisation in England or America, where everything represents the utmost result of our present development; but what will be usually the result both with the individual and the race? The savage mind will be unable to grasp and assimilate one-third of the wonders presented to his consideration, and will probably even suffer from the shock. We cannot expect the negroes of West Africa to become all at once intelligent, self-governing people. For many years the white races must be their guardians and educators, and we must educate the negro by force if necessary, leaving him to understand us afterwards, when we have raised him to a condition to do so. This, then, is our mission in West Africa: to instruct the natives that idleness is the eighth deadly sin; next, to so instruct the native as to the existence of the resources of this country; and, lastly, to educate him in the principles of civilised society, and so assimilate his views with our own that he and we may be bound together with the ties of commerce and Empire.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}]",True

In view of the persistent argument that Africa was colonized because of its poverty and lack of development, it is noteworthy that at least Madagascar, during the period under review, established important reforms which, as a British admiral observed in March 1881, had made the Malagasy 'a race fit to govern their land; and the fact obviated the necessity for the intervention of any outside nation'. 70 However, when the Scramble came, such developments did not shield Madagascar from the pressures of foreign intervention; in some ways, modernity had weakened the Kingdom;$^{71}$ in other ways, the reforms also strengthened the resistance that the Malagasy were able to muster."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.744, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Madagascar, 1880S-1930S: African initiatives and reaction to colonial conquest and domination', 'section_title': 'A country united by its submission to France and its opposition to colonial domination > The first reactions in opposition to the colonial system', 'content': ""In Antananarivo, seven students from the capital's medical school, which was the only institution providing tuition for the highest degree then open to Malagasy nationals, created the VVS in July 1913, just after the publica› tion of a series of articles written by the Protestant minister Ravelojaona under the title of 'Japan and the Japanese'.$^{28}$ These articles called on the Malagasy to model themselves on Japan, where modernism and tradition had been so skilfully blended.

Victor Augagneur, his successor, saw the reasons as lying in the 'surfeit of administration' (increased taxation, abuses in tax collection, and the tyrannical attitude of heads of military posts or isolated settlers). These explanations were inadequate, since they overlooked an essential aspect of the insurrection (the struggle for the recovery of freedom) and the organizational ability of the insurgents, who attacked all those who personified the colonial administration, whether they were French occupying forces or Malagasy civil servants or schoolteachers. By way of conclusion to his study of the 1904 rebellion, G. Jacob states that it undoubtedly had a twofold significance: 'it was a fight for independence and a struggle against colonial exploitation'.$^{26}$ The suppression of this first revolt against the oppression of the administration forced the Malagasy to seek other forms of struggle.\nOne of the most widespread forms of anti-colonial response was passive resistance: a refusal to comply with orders; the rejection of everything that was regarded as a sign of 'civilization' but was closely bound up with colonization and the foreign presence; keeping children away from school, which was looked upon in some circles as merely being a form of 'colonial forced labour'; and abandonment of the villages created along the roads in the south in an attempt to keep the population together. These refusals to co-operate did not seem dangerous to the colonizers, who believed that peace had finally been established in Madagascar in 1905. But then, suddenly, in 1915, the revolt of the Sadiavahe the nickname given to the insurgents - broke out in the south-west, while in Antananarivo the police discovered the existence of a secret society known as Vy Vato Sakelika or VVS - 'strong and hard like stone and iron' (see Fig. 10.3)."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.745, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Madagascar, 1880S-1930S: African initiatives and reaction to colonial conquest and domination', 'section_title': 'A country united by its submission to France and its opposition to colonial domination > From colonization to the dawning of the national movement', 'content': ""These economic changes and the political upheavals they engendered inevitably caused social and cultural transformations.

The first was the political evolution of the country and the diplomatic interaction between Madagascar and foreign powers, particularly Britain and France. Second, major changes took place in the social organization of the country, par› ticularly in the religious, administrative and economic fields. Political evolution consisted mainly of the consolidation of the Merina monarchy and the expansion of its authority to the rest of the island. The diplomatic relations that this monarchy maintained with both Britain and France became a cornerstone of the country's development. The changes that were effected in administration, particularly in the establishment of law and order, facilitated economic development. This was also a major factor in Madagascar's efforts to modernize itself and to resist foreign domination. The embracing of foreign religions was viewed as part of this process of modernization.\nA brief description of the country and its people may be necessary here. There are some eighteen ethnic groups in Madagascar of which the largest and, as it turned out, the most important in the nineteenth century, are the Merina who live on the central plateau of the island. This central plateau, known as Imerina (the country which one sees from afar), was the home of the Merina among whom there was a privileged class who came to rule the greater part of the island before it was colonized by the French. It is difficult to say what the population of Madagascar was during the period under review, but the British consul in Madagascar estimated it to be 5 million in 1865, of whom about 800 000 were Merina.$^{1}$ All the Malagasy groups speak the same language and have, with few exceptions, similar customs and religious traditions.

That purportedly 'barbarous' kingdom, where the 'forces of darkness' predominated, was, in fact, ruled by a queen and a prime minister who had been converts to Christianity since 2i February 1869. It is true that they had been baptized as Protestants and that the majority of the leaders and the population had followed their example, but they had not prevented people from embracing Catholicism nor had they thwarted the activities of the French missionaries. This liberal attitude goes to show the separation that existed between the churches and the state, even though 'around the chapel in the queen's palace, the Prime Minister may have tried to form a national Church, the Palace Church, composed of Malagasy churchmen and evangelists in his service'. 5 These attempts gave rise to lingering fears among the Jesuits and to an 'incorrigible mistrust' among the representatives of the London Missionary Society (LMS).\nIn 1877, the royal government freed the Masombika slaves imported from the African mainland and arranged for them to be settled on lands allocated to them. In 1878, it recast the legal system, which was henceforward entrusted to three courts whose task it was to conduct investigations, while decision-making lay with the prime minister. The 'Code of 305 Articles, a legislative innovation embracing civil law, criminal law and legal procedure'$^{6}$ was promulgated in 1881.

On the contrary, he started out by attempting, as the Minister had instructed him to do, to combat the Merina hegemony and to embark on the 'politique des races' which had earlier been tried out in the Soudan (French West Africa) and Indochina. Former sovereigns or their sons were accordingly brought into the administration as 'native governors', while 'internal protectorates' were created among the extensive kingdoms in the west and south-west. This system did not prove satis› factory, however, and from 1905 onwards the number of Merina assistants was increased to a disproportionate degree, since the Merina were regarded as being more suitable material for 'progress and adaptation' than the other peoples. Finally, GalliØni introduced French settlers (colons) and Asian immigrant workers into the new colony which greatly alienated the indigenous people.

An occasional correspondent residing at Antananarivo, has favoured us with a lengthy communication on this subject which, we feel sure will be perused with interest by our readers:—\n\nThe Malagasy nation has spoken. Twenty thousand representatives have declared that Madagascar shall not, without a desperate struggle, be subordinated to French rule. The vast arena of Andohalo—the public meeting-place of Antananarivo—presented the appearance of an amphitheatre. On every side huge multitudes stood, listening to the statement of the Prime Minister that M. Le Myre de Vilers has presented such demands to the Malagasy Government as would, if yielded to, for ever make the Malagasy the dependents of France. ""Has the Government been right in rejecting the demands?"" his Excellency asked, as he finished his speech on the French ultimatum. And in answer to the inquiry, there went up a shout of derision at the French demands. There was no doubt left that ""the heart of a people beat with one desire."" Then the national indignation broke through the desire for peace, and a torrent of eloquence rushed from the mouths of scores of orators. The ""love of peace that was full of wrongs and shames"" was over and done. But there was no wish for war. Only a determination to face that alternative, should France assail the independence of the Malagasy.\n\nWe British dwelling among this people believe that the British Government will not exercise every resource which diplomacy admits to attain a revision of an Anglo-French Convention.\n\nThe Europeans in the interior are pursuing their usual vocations; indeed, there is no need for a feeling of uneasiness. The Prime Minister recently received a deputation from them with the greatest cordiality, dwelling affectionately upon the good-will between the British and Norwegians, and the Malagasy. And he assured them that there was no danger for British and Norwegians, and besides they could always rely upon the personal friendship that he had for every one of them.\n\nThe French officials, previous to their departure, burnt up the Residency effects. Imagine a French ambassador in London burning the Embassy\'s belongings, because of strained political relations. Mr. Punch would, surely, not let such an incident pass unsatirised.\n\nProgress in Madagascar cannot be forwarded by aggression.

The paragraph which we published last month from the French papers was one calculated to cause some inquietude, except that, as our friends of the London Missionary Society justly observe, ""Every communication since the death of the late King, coming through the French medium, has proved to be either greatly exaggerated or wholly unfounded. That a revolution so recent, so sudden, and involving the assassination of Radama, who had been greatly beloved by large classes of the people, should be followed by temporary disorder and acts of hostility on the part of outlying tribes, was naturally to be expected. Such events, we have every reason to believe, have actually occurred. The Sakalavas, for instance, have always been forward to assert their independence, and at least a part of that tribe appears to have seized the opportunity to make inroads and commit acts of plunder upon the property of the Hovas.""\n\nIn the last letter received from the Rev. Mr. Ellis (the only dependable authority), dated July 2, these acts of hostility are alluded to, and it would seem that the danger had passed away, and that representatives from the different native tribes were then in the capital, professing their allegiance to the Queen."" The following, on the above subject, and on the general character and proceedings of the Government, are from Mr. Ellis\'s letter:—\n\n""A number of representatives from the Betsileo, the Sakalavas, and the Betsimisaraka, have come and are still coming to take the oath of allegiance to the new sovereign. They have all been most generously treated, admitted to the presence of the Queen, surrounded by all her officers, addressed kindly and encouragingly, as well as gratified by presents of cattle, &c., and are to-morrow to be entertained at a royal banquet at the palace. The affairs of the kingdom constitute now the business of the Government, in which Christians and Hovas are combined, promptitude and activity are everywhere apparent, and all parties are more careful in their public conduct. This state of things is not unfavourable to the Christians. The hereditary policy of the Hovas is \'Things as they have been;\' \'The wisdom of our ancestors cannot be surpassed.\' But so many innovations have turned out improvements and benefits, that the aim now seems to be to adopt what is good in the new, while retaining what they can of the old. All parties are deeply sensible of the advantages depending on the continuance of their friendship with England and France, which it is most ardently to be desired nothing may disturb.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-10-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1863#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'FRANCE AND MADAGASCAR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Malagasy Government has lately published the official correspondence between its Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Consuls of France. A more shameful story of arrogance and high-handed wrong-doing on the part of a first-rate European Power has been seldom given to the world. The first dispute, it seems, arose over the sale of land by the heirs of a former French Consul to a Roman Catholic priest. The Hova Government objected to the sale because the Consul in question, by Malagasy law, which prohibits the owning of land by foreigners, was only a life tenant. Moreover, the title-deeds which the Hova Government declare to have been forged, bore the signature of King Radama II., dated several months after that monarch\'s death. The French Consul attempted to explain this unpleasant fact away by different reckonings of the calendar, but the Hovas are able to prove that not a single document of Radama II.\'s reign bears the date of 1864 except the particular one in dispute. The second dispute arose over the death of four French sailors on the coast. These men were, from the Malagasy standpoint, nothing more nor less than smugglers, who were landing weapons of war and ammunition, contrary to treaty. A Malagasy chief endeavoured to stop this traffic, and was fired upon by the French smugglers, whereupon the fire was returned, with the result that four of the French were killed and the goods in question seized. In the end the Hova Government paid an indemnity under protest. The trumped-up claim of the French to a Protectorate over the North-west Coast rests upon an alleged transfer of power by a certain chief to the French; but, apart from the fact that this man, as a vassal, had no right to alienate lands, the treaty which he did sign only allowed the French to settle for agricultural and commercial purposes, and to keep some armed men ""for their own protection."" We regret to find that the tone of the French officials throughout the controversy is to the last degree insolent and provocative. They appear to have acted upon the principle that weak nations have no rights which France is bound to respect; and that every Frenchman who finds himself in the territory of such a nation has a right to whatever he pleases, no matter what may be the law of the country. It is this kind of treatment of other nations which has more than once drawn down upon France evils and troubles which have shaken the whole commonwealth to its very centre.

The deputation was introduced by Mr. Alexander M\'Arthur, M.P., Chairman of the Madagascar Committee. Lord Granville was accompanied by Sir Charles Dilke (Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs), Sir Julian Pauncefote (Permanent Secretary), and Mr. D. V. Lister. Mr. Alexander M\'Arthur, M.P., in opening the subject, after remarking that the deputation represented nearly all who felt special interest in Madagascar, including the British and Foreign Bible Society and various missionary societies, and alluding to the presence of missionaries who had laboured there, spoke of the great progress made by the country during the last twenty or thirty years in civilization and freedom, and urged that her Majesty\'s Government should try to induce the French Government to leave the people of Madagascar to manage their own affairs, adding that it would be a great misfortune if France should establish a protectorate, notwithstanding their protest against such a step. Mr. F. W. Chesson (honorary secretary) then read a memorial on the subject, in which it was remarked that the French demanded that the Malagasy Government should consent to a French protectorate over the western and north-western coasts of the island, from Cape Ambro to the port of Mojanga; that French vessels entering the ports of the territory now claimed had for many years past paid Customs duties to the Malagasy officials stationed there; that it was believed that there were five times as many English as French subjects in Madagascar; that our trade was quadruple that of the French; and that a large portion of the food supply of the British colony of Mauritius was drawn from Madagascar; and further, that the memorialists could not contemplate without alarm the prospect of Réunion and other French colonies making the north-west provinces of the island the scene of a traffic in African labour—slave trade. The memorial was supported by Mr. W. E. Forster, M.P., who remarked that the deputation had no unfriendly feeling towards France, and pointed out the close bearing of the question of a French protectorate on the slave trade; by Sir Henry Barkly, who, as a former Governor of Mauritius, spoke of the increasing trade between that colony and Madagascar as likely to be seriously injured by the threatened protectorate; by Bishop Ryan, who entered into diplomatic details to show that the claim set up by France had no real foundation, citing words used by the French Envoy, M. Lambert, twenty years ago in support of that view; and by Mr. Marshall, a director of the London Missionary Society; Mr. J. N. Richardson, M.P., representing the Society of Friends; and the Rev. F. Gregory, representing the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, all of whom dwelt on the religious, educational, and civilizing benefits conferred on Madagascar by their respective societies, and deprecated what they considered likely to produce contrary effects.

The officer who gave me this statement informed me also, with evident pleasure, that all the members of the Government had carefully examined the treaty with England, and agreed to accept it, and fulfil its conditions.""\n\nIn further elucidation of the above events, Mr. Ellis writes to a friend:—\n\n""One of the items in the document containing the principles of Government adopted by the present Queen, is that which requires the Sovereign of Madagascar to abstain from all spirituous liquors. They ascribe much that is to be deplored in Radama\'s character to his having been so easily intoxicated, and are determined, if it be possible, to prevent this evil for the future. This was the weak point which laid Radama open to bad advisers; hence the cruelty and treachery of foreign intriguers, who took advantage of his weakness and excitement, which they themselves brought on, to accomplish purposes which he would not have entertained in his sane moments. It was under the influence of their wine that he signed the fatal treaty with a well-known foreigner, and other documents which he did not understand, and it was this evil which finally accelerated the loss of his reason and his life.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1863#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Situation in Madagascar', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Little by little, the truth about Madagascar affairs is obtaining a hearing in Europe. The misapprehension that still largely prevails, however, justifies a reiteration of the relative positions occupied by the contending parties—the Malagasy and the French—and of the serious consequences entailed upon the leading trading nations of the world by the continuance of the present state of affairs. Summarizing, for the benefit of our readers, the more important facts as contained in the latest news to hand from the island, the first point to be noted is that now the excitement created at the outset is over, a great deal of that bitter feeling always existing at the commencement of wars has worn off, and Mauritians and Bourbonnais, English and French, alike all see that the only result of the war is to bring bankruptcy and ruin on everybody except the Malagasy. Fortunately, there is not the least danger for Madagascar at present, for eleven ships and 4,000 men are of no more use to bring the Malagasy to terms than a circus procession would be. There are about twenty-two well-known ports and creeks on the East Coast, and many more than that on the West Coast; and vessels which are determined upon running a blockade will do so. Even for capturing the Malagasy camp situated within cannon-shot of Tamatave, the French forces are not yet sufficient, much less for a march on the capital. Admiral Miot has already made three attempts to attack the Malagasy camp, but has signally failed. The policy of the Malagasy is strictly defensive, so that the outside world have nothing to expect in the way of thrilling accounts of massacres, and M. Jules Ferry is not likely to have any occasion to appeal to the emotions of the Parisians by draping the beautiful Church La Madeleine in black cloth for the loss of an Admiral or a General or a Minister; consequently the solution of the Madagascar question depends entirely upon the balance of ""plain facts"" which are gradually oozing out as to the real truth of the matter, both for and against the French and Malagasy respectively.\n\nThe origin of the present political and military difficulties is to be traced to the undue immigration of poor settlers—men anxious to find labour, but without capital—from the Mauritius and Bourbon Islands. Now the fact is, the Hovas do not want foreign labour, but they do want foreign capital. The Hovas probably now see that they have opened the road to poor immigrants, and then filled that road with formalities which to the poor man are simply obstructions, instead of opening the road to rich capitalists, to whom the aforesaid obstructions would appear merely legitimate sources of revenue to the Malagasy Government.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1884#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Situation in Madagascar', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The consequence is that the Madagascar war has been brought on by the hungry rabble; and where do we see a single capitalist or merchant who will stand up for the Malagasy? Another cause which has left the Malagasy all behind in the race is the power of the press against them. Mauritius and Bourbon count ten newspapers which feed the French papers—i.e., about ten millions of readers hear nothing but bad reports about the Hovas. Even the *Merchants\' and Planters\' Gazette* of Mauritius, in its number for May 20, 1884, believes that it is telling the truth when it represents the English and Americans as ""gaining concessions of land which are relentlessly refused to France."" People seem to confound altogether a ""concession"" and a ""lease,"" but the French people do not; and however much Governments pretend not to be influenced by the public press, it is very certain that all these false reports are only provoking jealousy and fanning the flame of war. When the Malagasy Ambassadors went to Europe, even their presence and influence could not withstand the current of false opinions about the Hova people. Then followed the Malagasy official *Gazette*, which now keeps us informed of the truth, but which is hated like a viper because it does publish the truth. The false structure built up by unprincipled agitators is beginning to totter. The idea of impoverishing the Hovas is absurd. Imerina is rich in cattle, its agricultural resources are unbounded; iron, copper, and lead are plentiful for making arms. Cotton is plentiful for weaving. Imerina could supply the London market with eggs and poultry without any appreciable diminution, and as long as the French leave a single creek open, they might just as well...\n\nas well give up blockading altogether, as far as the Hovas are concerned. Wherever the French settle, even if they succeeded in settling anywhere, the natives would desert them, and they would have to import even rice, or plant it themselves. For every agriculturist who settles, they will require two soldiers to guard him, and a doctor to attend him in the fever. The natives will always prefer to work for the English and Americans, who are friendly with the Hovas, for the same wages, and no fear of punishment, than to work for the French under penalty of having their heads cut off. The Hovas have the most powerful weapon against the French as long as they hold Imerina; they have simply to call in foreign capital to start iron works, lead works, sheep-farming on the healthy hills of the interior, and leave the fever-stricken French Creoles with a gun in one hand and a spade in the other to linger out a jeopardised existence.

That Great Britain had never yielded to the temptation to take possession of that magnificent island when there were none to oppose her in so doing, was a reason why France should not attempt to disturb existing international understandings with regard to it and other independent native African territories. But now a thirst for colonial aggrandisement has clearly taken possession of the French official mind. The Republic must have its glories somewhere. Where? Let her get them on the side of Tonquin, and of Africa. And we do not see that Great Britain can justly take exception to this. She has had her day of conquests and annexations, and why should it follow that because she is sated and ""cares"" now ""for none of these things,"" therefore no such aspirations as those in which she formerly indulged shall be cherished by France or any other European nation? If to conquer and colonize be a sin on the part of France, it is certainly not Britain that should cast the first stone. We may be grieved; there has been a feeling of great interest created in England on behalf of Madagascar, where it has been believed that something like an enlightened and Christian native Government had been established; and there will also be some serious injury sustained by some portion of Her Majesty\'s colonial possessions by Madagascar being shut up against the rest of the world by the jealous French colonial rule and regulations as regards trade. But this cannot be avoided if the French do take possession. Earl Granville has, we are convinced, done all that could possibly be done on behalf of the Madagascar people and Government; but as we have not any territorial rights in Madagascar, having always refrained from acquiring any, so that we might not tempt others to go in also, it seems to us that we cannot do anything but acquiesce should Madagascar be made a French colonial possession. We may nationally as well as individually sympathize and feel deeply, and we do sympathize and feel deeply; but there is a wide gulf between this and going to war with the object of maintaining the independence of Madagascar. If France fancies she has need of the island, and believes that she has a pretext that justifies her in her own eyes in taking possession of it, we do not see how she can be prevented having it. And any armed resistance on the part of the Hovas should be deprecated rather than encouraged by any portion of the British Press or people, because it is absurd to suppose that a nation like France, once embarked on the enterprise of subjugating Madagascar, would desist until she had fully effected her object. In our view, however, there is more than the subjugation of Madagascar at issue in this matter. It is the demand there will be, on the part of French planters and colonists, for negro labour that fills us with apprehension that there will be a great renewal of the foreign slave-trade from East Africa, under the name, perhaps, of free apprenticeships, but in reality bondage, with all its cruelties. This action, moreover, on the part of France may open a new era of European enterprise (not British) to take possession of what are looked upon as, and for the most part are, the hitherto unannexed uncivilized portions of the earth. We have not always agreed with the modern determination of Great Britain against annexing territories the inhabitants of which are uncivilized, and who would fall a ready prey to adventurers from other European countries. Not because we have any land greed, but because, with all its faults, British Crown government has done more than would have been done by any other government for the spread of civilization, while energetic British Missionary Societies never fail to send the message of the Gospel of peace and salvation to peoples thus taken under British rule. There will be trouble on the West Coast of Africa some day through our not having established British rule over the so-called Oil River territories.

Mr. Ellis, who writes on the 16th May, says:—\n\n""The King was addicted to many superstitious notions about dreams and spiritual agencies, habitually enforcing any argument with the expression that he believed it, for it was right, because \'God told him so.\' Any account of supernatural appearances or phenomena had a peculiar charm for him, much more so than any direct reasoning upon cause and effect.""\n\nThe persons interested in the continuance of heathen customs took advantage of this. A species of heathen spiritualism was got up.\n\n""A sort of mental epidemic appeared in the adjacent provinces and in the capital. The subjects of this disease pretended to be unconscious of their actions; to be unable to refrain from leaping, running, dancing, &c. They also saw visions and heard voices from the invisible world. One of these visions, seen by many, was the ancestors of the King, and the voices they heard announced the coming of these ancestors to tell the King what he was to do for the good of the country. Subsequently a message was brought to him as from his ancestors, to the effect that, if he did not stop \'the praying,\' some great calamity would soon befall him. To the surprise of his best friends, the King was exceedingly interested in this strange movement, seemed to believe the pretended message from the world of spirits, and encouraged the frantic dancers, who daily thronged his house, and declared that the disease would continue to increase till \'the praying\' was stopped. It is generally reported that these movements were prompted by the guardians of the idols, and promoted by his own Mena maso,* who bribed parties to come as sick persons in large numbers from the country, in order to continue the delusion.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1863#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE REVOLUTION IN MADAGASCAR', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""It was then proposed to assassinate a number of Christians, as a means of stopping the progress of Christianity, and also to kill the chief nobles who opposed the King\'s proceedings. With a view of increasing the influence of this fanatical party, the King issued an order that all persons meeting any of the so-called sick should take off their hats, and thus show them the same mark of respect as was formerly given to the national idols when they were carried through the city. With the view, also, of shielding the perpetrators of the intended murders, the King announced his intention to issue an order, or law, that any person or persons wishing to fight with fire-arms, swords, or spears, should not be prevented, and that if any one were killed the murderer should not be punished. This alarmed the whole community. On the 7th inst. Radama repeated before his Ministers and others in the palace his determination to issue that order; and among all the Mena maso present only three opposed the issuing of the order; many were silent; the rest expressed their approval. The nobles and heads of the people spent the day in deliberating on the course they should pursue, and the next morning the Prime Minister, with about 100 of the nobles and heads of the people, including the Commander-in-Chief, the King\'s Treasurer, and the first officer of the palace, went to the King, and remonstrated against his legalising murder, and besought him most earnestly not to issue such order. It is said that the Prime Minister went on his knees before him, and begged him not to issue this obnoxious law; but he remained unmoved. The Minister then rose and said to the King: \'Do you say before all these witnesses that if any man is going to fight another with fire-arms, sword, or spear, that you will not prevent him, and that if he kills any one he shall not be punished?\' The King replied: \'I agree to that.\' Then said the Minister, \'It is enough; we must arm;\' and, turning to his followers, said, \'Let us return.\' I saw the long procession as they passed my house, grave and silent, on their way to the Minister\'s dwelling.

The first is the long stretch of east coast from Antongil Bay to Fort Dauphin, forming almost a straight line. It contains not a single really good natural harbour, nor a decently navigable river of any length, and most of its towns are only approached by dangerous roadsteads. From its geographical position it will easily be understood that its foreign element are mostly Mauritians. The natural resources of this coast have been to a great extent exhausted, and the prospects now lie principally in sugar-planting. The Mauritians are naturally acquainted with this industry, and there is a great future before them. Coffee is also a profitable undertaking, but it must not be planted at a lower elevation than 1,500 feet above the level of the sea. Spices of almost every kind can also be cultivated auxiliary to the sugar plantations. The second division is that called the North-east Coast, being that part between Antongil Bay and Cape Amber. It contains two or three harbours, but not very good ones. The forests here are much larger than in any other part, and consequently the natural supplies of India-rubber and gum-copal are still plentiful. This is the most thinly populated part of the island, but exceedingly fertile. Probably in a few more years the natural resources will be exhausted, and foreign residents will then have recourse to agriculture, with better results perhaps than can be obtained on any other part of the East Coast. The third division of the Coast is the North-west, from Cape Amber to Cape St. Andrew, and the part coveted by France. This part contains lignite deposits and valuable woods, and is full of good harbours. Its foreign element consists chiefly of Indians and Muslims, and a few French Creoles. The fourth division is the West Coast, properly called—i.e., from Cape St. Andrew North to St. Augustine South. Full of good harbours and navigable rivers, it is probably the finest part of Madagascar. The foreigners there are mostly Americans and Englishmen, who carry on a trade with the Cape and Natal. The fifth part is the Southern portion, from St. Augustine to Fort Dauphin, about which nothing is really known.\n\nIt will be seen, then, how little is yet known of the vast commercial resources of this island, and of the number of industries that may be opened. The trade of the last few months has been characterised by a little more activity, but at best can only be said to be very slack. The coast merchants are still prevented from exporting such articles as would afford supplies to the French armies, or were prevented up to a very short time ago.

Usually, there was no large standing army as such. War was a kind of enterprise, or a feature of the enterprise in search of political power and control of economic resources. The warrior was often an entrepreneur who, having amassed some wealth from trading, was in a position to attract followers or to recruit or capture slaves to serve in his private army. With this he pursued his interest in search of political and economic power, either independently or as part of the resources available for the use of a state. If successful, he thus acquired title to an office which he used to integrate himself into a political system.

The most intense rivalry was between the British and the French. The British tried to secure their interests by also playing the role of protectors of Portuguese interests. This gave Bismarck the opportunity to play the role of an interested broker by convening an International Conference in Berlin. This Conference in turn gave King Leopold his chance to seek for international support for his ambitions on the Congo by proclaiming free trade and humanitarian antislavery ambitions.$^{24}$ This prepared the way for the Brussels Act which banned the supply of arms to African rulers in the name of an anti-slavery campaign.\nThe truth was that by linking the limitation of arms with the anti-slavery campaign, the British were able to exempt the 'self-governing' settlers in South Africa from the operations of the Brussels Act. By this device also, while constantly fighting African states and negotiating various treaties and conventions with African rulers, they could pretend that, by owning slaves and dealing in slaves, African states enjoyed no recognition in international law. It was thus possible to pretend in the General Act of the Berlin Conference of 1885 and the Brussels Act of 1889 that in international law Africa was a terra nullius and only European powers and settlers had interests there that had to be protected."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.557, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The First World War and its consequences', 'section_title': 'The African involvement in the War', 'content': ""Recruits for both fighting and carrier service were raised by three methods.

In some areas they had no difficulty in obtaining genuine volunteers; in others, men were impressed by the chiefs and presented to the political officers as volunteers. Much of the unpopularity of chiefs in Northern Rhodesia after the war can be attributed to their role in recruitment of soldiers and carriers. 25 Large numbers of soldiers and carriers, however, were formally con› scripted. In French Black Africa, a Decree of 1912 aimed at creating a permanent black army made military service for four years compulsory for all African males between the ages of 20 and 28. The aim was to replace garrison troops in Algeria with black African troops so that the former would be available for service in Europe in the eventuality of war. If such a war were prolonged, General Mangin wrote, 'Our African forces would constitute an almost indefinite reserve, the source of which is beyond the reach of the adversary.' After the outbreak of war, with 14785 Afri› can troops in West Africa alone, it was decided to recruit 50000 more during the 1915-16 recruitment campaign. Thus began in French Africa an exercise called by Governor Angoulvant a vØritable chasse à l'homme$^{26}$ and recently described by Jide Osuntokun as a new slave trade. 27 Chiefs were given quotas of men to fill, and rounded up strangers and former slaves to avoid enlisting their immediate dependants or kinsmen. Since births were not registered, many men above and below military age were recruited. But, as we shall see, the recruitment campaign provoked widespread revolts and the insurgent areas were impossible to recruit in. Desperate for more men and in the hope that an African of high standing might succeed where Frenchmen had not, the French Government resorted to the appointment in 1918 of Blaise Diagne as High Commissioner for the Recruitment of Black Troops.

E. Betts' contribution (Chapter 13), a full-time or standing army. As has been amply demonstrated, most traditional African states south of the Sahara did not have standing armies. In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W. Gutteridge has admitted, the armed forces have 'operated in the longer term against the stability of the ex-colonies'.

In fact, African reactions were the very reverse. It is quite evident that Africans were faced with only two options, either to readily surrender their sovereignty and independence, or to defend them at all costs. It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.\nJohn D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty.

These in turn were under the supervision of four divisional indunas, with Mzilikazi himself at the apex of the system.\nNearly all adult men formed part of the army, and therefore belonged to regiments. These regiments lived in regimental towns. Married members of a regiment were allowed to live in the regimental town with their wives and servants. They constituted a kind of reserve force that could be called up in an emergency. Sons were enrolled in the same regiments as their fathers. Thus, instead of youths being recruited into a single regiment from all the communities forming part of the state (as was the case among the Sotho-Tswana), membership of a regimental town became hereditary. Occasionally, when population growth warranted it, Mzilikazi would select youths from the various regimental towns to form a new regiment which would be placed under its own induna who would then be permitted to build a new regimental town. Each regimental town was under the supervision of both its induna and one of Mizilikazi's queens.\nIt is essential to note, however, that while the regimental system operated in this manner for the purpose of absorbing the youth, not all the conquered people lived in the regimental towns.

Still, I have been able to send many of my things by carts hither, which saved me a good deal of trouble in passing 50lb. loads.\n\n_As for the cotton prospects_, I know this much, that the Crepee people are beginning to have confidence in the promises to buy their cotton, so they have sold a good deal to Mr. Brandt, and will probably farm cotton on a larger scale. There is wanted more energy in buying the cotton, and machinery to cleanse it.

However, the articles also point out contradictions in the King's actions, such as sending reinforcements and not addressing European prisoners, and emphasize the Ashanti's historical resistance to British influence and strategic use of diplomacy. This suggests a more complex relationship with the British, characterized by both pragmatic negotiation and an assertion of sovereignty, rather than a straightforward belief in British superiority.

It thus indicated the way in which the colonial situation, in providing education, was also providing the instrument of its own ultimate destruction. This was the basis of the antagonism that the colonial governments thereafter showed to the educated elite.\nIn 1872 the Asante sent an invasion force south to enforce what they regarded as their ancient right to Elmina and to revive their claims to Assin, Denkyira and Akyem. Having suppressed the Confederation and bought out the Dutch in 1872, the British decided to organize a response that would settle the Asante question once and for all.

In 1850 and 1863 war was narrowly averted but between 1869 and 1872, the Asante launched a three-pronged attack which resulted in the occupation of virtually all the southern and coastal states of the Gold Coast. To beat back the Asante, the British government launched one of the best organized campaigns of the period under the command of one of the most famous British officers of the day, General Garnet Wolseley. Armed with the latest weapons, this army succeeded in pushing the Asante army across the Pra river and entered and sacked Kumasi in February 1874 after a very fierce last-ditch stand by the Asante army at Amoafo near Bekwai. 40 This decisive defeat of the Asante by the British in 1874 had very far-reaching consequences and was to influence, to a great extent, the reactions of the Asante during the period 1880-1900. The first obvious effect was the disintegration of the Asante empire. By the Treaty of Fomena, Asante recognized the independence of all the vassal states south of the Pra. Taking advantage of the weakening of the military power of Asante, the vassal states to the north of the Volta river also broke away. Even the core of the empire that remained began to break up.

He had a twofold objective: to keep Asante at bay and to bring the coastal peoples under his control. He therefore had a tripartite FanteBritish-Asante treaty signed whereby the parties recognized the inde› pendence of the coastal countries south of the Pra river, agreed to bring any conflict before the British party and undertook to keep trade routes open. Maclean tried gradually to acquaint the Fante with English legal principles through a hierarchy of courts ranging from the chiefs' courts to those over which he himself presided.

Those African rulers who have been mistakenly termed collaborators were those who thought that the best way of safeguarding their sovereignty or even regaining the sovereignty that they might have lost to some African power previous to the arrival of the Europeans was not to collaborate but rather to ally with the European invaders. A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation.

But the last straw that really precipitated action was the demand of the British governor, Arnold Hodgson, for the Golden Stool to be sent to him so that he could sit on it. The Golden Stool was the most sacred object of the Asante, which they considered as the embodiment of their soul and a symbol of their survival as a nation. That demand, therefore, could not but touch off an instantaneous rebellion of nearly all the principal states under the leadership of the Queen of Edweso, Nana Yaa Asantewaa (see Plate 6.2). 64 The Asante forces attacked the Governor and his party who had to seek refuge in the fort at Kumasi which the Asante then besieged. When the governor and his party escaped from the fort, the Asante fought several pitched battles with the British which lasted from April to November 1900 when Yaa Asantewaa was arrested and deported with other Asante generals to the Seychelles.\nSimilar revolts, pitched battles and guerrilla warfare raged in the Ivory Coast in response to the brutal methods including forced labour and high taxation used by that cruel Governor, Angoulvant, for the consolidation of French rule and the exploitation of the colony.

The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy.

I do not write this in a boastful spirit but in the clear sense of its meaning ... the cause of Asante is progressing and there is no reason for any Asante man to feel alarm at the prospects or to believe for a single instant that our cause has been driven back by the events of the past hostilities. 2\nIn 1895, Wobogo, the Moro Naba, or King of the Mossi (in modern Upper Volta), told the French officer, Captain Destenave: I know that the whites wish to kill me in order to take my country, and yet you claim that they will help me to organize my country. But I find my country good just as it is. I have no need of them.

Though the Oba himself would have liked to submit, a majority of his chiefs raised an army to beat back the invasion. They were, however, defeated and the capital was looted of its precious bronze treasures and then burnt. 48 In the Niger Delta, as in many other areas of Nigeria, the British had signed treaties of protection with most of the chiefs by 1884. However, while some, like Calabar and Bonny, had allowed missionaries to operate in their states, others had not. Moreover, all of them were insisting on their sovereign rights to regulate trade and to levy duties on British traders. This, the new British consuls, such as Hewett and Johnston, would not tolerate. A typical example of the rulers who stood up to the British consuls and missionaries was Jaja of Opobo (see Plate 6.3). He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order. When Jaja still refused to comply in spite of Johnston's threats to bombard his town with British gunboats, Johnston enticed Jaja on board a ship in 1887 under a promise of safeconduct but arrested him and sent him to Accra$^{49}$ where he was tried and deported to the West Indies. The other Delta states - Old Calabar, New Calabar, Brass and Bonny - stunned by this treatment of one of the most powerful and wealthy rulers of the Delta states and divided internally, surrendered and accepted governing councils imposed on them by Johnston."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': ""However, with the Akan states the problem was essentially one of sovereignty. There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'The Zulu, Ndebele, Bemba and Yao: the politics of confrontation > The Zulu', 'content': ""The Zulu under Cetshwayo and the Ndebele under Lobengula therefore decided on the strategy of confrontation using first the tactics of diplomacy and later those of armed resistance.

His inveterate enemies being the Transvaal Boers, he maintained an effective alliance with the English colonists of the Natal and he developed friendly relations with Theophilus Shepstone, the famous Secretary for Native Affairs in Natal. But when the British annexed the Transvaal in 1877 and made Shepstone the Administrator, Cetshwayo's alliance system quickly collapsed. Shepstone then supported the Boers, who had crossed the Buffalo river into Zululand, pegged out farms and were claiming land titles. The new British High Commissioner for South Africa, Sir Bartle Frere, was also intent on achieving the federation of settler colonies.$^{4}$ Shepstone convinced him that such a federation could not be achieved in South Africa until the military power of the Zulu nation had been broken, and that the very existence of the Zulu nation threatened the security and economic development of Natal.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858.

There were three major contending forces in the Scramble for Bechuanaland (now Botswana). These were the four Bechuanaland rulers (the rulers of the Kwena, the Ngwato, the Ngwaketse and the Tswana) and their missionary allies who wanted British imperial protection and trusteeship; the Transvaal Boers who looked upon Bechuanaland as their natural hinterland for land, livestock, minerals and labour; and the Cape colonists, represented by Rhodes, who wanted to forestall Boer expansion and alliance with the Germans in South West Africa (now Namibia). The African rulers, like Moshoeshoe, sought to forestall settler colonial rule by acquiring pro› tectorate status. When alarmed by a dissident sect of the Dutch Reformed Church in the Transvaal - the Doppers - who wanted to cross through Tswana territories to Damaraland in 1876, Kgama, king of the Ngwato section of the Tswana, had written to the 'Great Queen of the English People' requesting protection. He wanted to know the conditions for protection and he emphasized that the relationship would be guided by 'Christian morality'. Furthermore, his rival brother, Kgamane, had settled in the Transvaal with his followers and was fighting with the Boers in the hope of gaining the Ngwato throne (see Fig. 9.1).\nThe British were bitterly divided over Bechuanaland. The RhodesRobinson group wanted to eliminate the imperial factor in favour of settler colonialism - including joint annexation by the Cape and the Transvaal, which only failed because the Transvaal refused. But the MackenzieWarren humanitarian-imperialist groups, like the African rulers, wanted to forestall settler colonialsim, because they were opposed to the brutality and destructiveness of settler colonialism over their Tswana Christian converts and church schools.

Secondly, overall British imperial supremacy in the Trans¬ vaal was guaranteed through British control of the republic's external relations as well as the British right to station and move military forces and equipment freely about in the Transvaal in time ofwar. The Boers obtained self-government, which indeed proved to be a stepping stone to greater freedom. Further negotiations produced the London Convention of 27 February 1884 under which Britain relinquished its control over the Africans, but retained control of the republic's foreign relations.51\nJust as the imperial forces were struggling to crush the Boer uprising, the Cape colonial forces were fighting the Sotho in a war that broke out on 13 September 1880. Just like the first Anglo-Boer War, the Lesotho armed conflict was intimately related to the British efforts to achieve a South African confederation. Both the Cape colonial government and the British officials at the Cape wanted to disarm the African states as a first step to federation. And it was the Sotho rejection of unilateral disarmament that led to the Cape-Sotho War of 1880-1.\nSince 1872 Lesotho had come under the Cape colonial administration. Indeed as part of the efforts to bring South Africa into a union, Gordon Sprigg, the Cape Prime Minister who had replaced Molteno, had colluded with Frere to have the Peace Preservation Bill passed by the Cape Par› liament in 1878. The legislation empowered the government to order the Africans in the Cape Colony to surrender their guns in return for compensation.

When he ascended the throne in 1894, he seemed to be suspicious of Europeans, mostly missionaries at that time, so he sought to restrict his people's interactions with them. Those among the Baganda who had embraced the Christian faith and who would not obey his orders were put to death as traitors.$^{29}$ Today, Christians regard them as martyrs. Mwanga was, however, violently resisting attempts by British agents to take over his country even though disguised as mission› aries. But his diplomatic ability also became apparent in the way he handled various, often warring religious sects. At one time, he would play the two Christian sects, Catholics and Protestants, against Muslims when he thought the latter were becoming too powerful and therefore threatening his control of the country. At another time, he would ally with Muslims against Catholics or Protestants or both depending on who he thought was dangerous to his rule. Thus, Mwanga was adept at the diplomatic game of divide and rule, a tactic which the colonizing powers were able to use so effectively in controlling Africa. When it was necessary, Mwanga resorted to a revival of some old tradition in an attempt to drive out all foreigners as happened in 1888.$^{30}$ On this occasion, he intended to entice all foreigners and their Baganda followers to a naval parade on an island on Lake Victoria. There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler. Later, however, in 1889, Mwanga managed to regain his throne only to be exiled to Kisimayu, as already indicated, in 1899, where he died in 1903."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': 'The European Scramble for East Africa and the patterns of African resistance > The response in Uganda', 'content': 'There were, however, those among the Baganda who allied themselves firmly with British imperialism in what has come to be known as Baganda sub-imperialism with regard to the rest of Uganda.

Better armed and employing groups of mercenaries, the British imposed their authority only by violence'. 16 On the coast, the Mazrui family resisted the take-over by the IBEAC. This resistance was led by Mbaruk bin Rashid who organized hit-and-run warfare against the superior weapons of the British forces. It took reinforce› ments of Indian troops brought in by the British to defeat him. He fled Tanganyika, only to fall into the hands of the Germans. The Mazrui resistance came about as a result of British attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the coastal societies. After the Mazrui family had settled in Takarungu on the Kenya coast, they had gradually begun to extend their influence to many parts of the coast. They acquired, for example, the monopoly of buying grain from the Mijikenda people along the coast and had thus come to control the sale of food crops on the coast. The monopoly was resisted by the Giriama between 1877 and 1883 when war broke out between the two groups. The Mazrui were defeated. There› after, they had come to some understanding with the Giriama whereupon the two communities became trading partners. The coming of the British interfered with this arrangement as well as the internal organization of the Mazrui society, providing one reason why the Mazrui resisted the imposition of British rule.\nWhen in 1895, the Wali Takarungu died, the IBEAC chose their local friend to succeed him instead of Mbaruk who had a better claim to the throne but was known not to favour the British presence.$^{17}$ It was for this reason that Mbaruk sought to drive the British away from the coast by force."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 242, 'article_title': 'Letter of an Ashantee Prince', 'full_section_title': 'Letter of an Ashantee Prince', 'last_edit_date': '09-16-1863', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1863#article-8', 'issue_date': '23_11_1863', 'content': ""Sir,—Before leaving for Accra you kindly promised to let me have a messenger to escort me as far as the Prah.

All kinds of rumours are afloat as to Kalcalli\'s intentions. Some think he merely desires to blind Sir Garnet, so as to gain time to complete his preparations for defence. I am not of that opinion. I sincerely believe that his game is entirely played out, and that he would gladly accept any terms, provided the white man would not so far disgrace him as to enter his capital! But if his capital were to be taken, I do not think the King and his chiefs would on this occasion resort to the old practice of blowing themselves up. They would trust to the well-known generosity and leniency of the white man. The prisoners give a most deplorable account of the state of affairs in the Ashanti kingdom. I interrogated one, who informed me that he was a slave of the chief of Obogoo, who was killed in one of the recent battles near Abrakrampa. This man states that out of 12,000 men furnished by the King of Juabin as his contingent to the army which invaded Fanti under Amanquatiah, not more than 3,000 returned, and that the chief who commanded them was wounded in the attack on Elmira, and was trampled to death by fugitives running over him. I asked him if any human sacrifices were made on the occasion of Amanquatiah\'s return to Coomassie, and he replied that that General returned home in such haste that there was no time to attend to any ceremonial, but that the King had recently issued a proclamation throughout the kingdom that in twenty days a general ""custom"" was to be made for all those who had fallen in the late war, and the twenty days expired on the very day we attacked them. By this he considered his life was saved, as, being a slave, he would have been assuredly sacrificed before the termination of the custom. Both prisoners agree in saying that the Ashantees have not the means of fighting two pitched battles in the neighbourhood of Coomassie, and that the outlying provinces could offer no resistance at all, so denuded are they of munitions of war. The want of salt alone, they say, will compel the King to choose between rebellion and peace at any price. King Attah is hourly expected at the head of his army, and without his force I doubt if it would be quite wise to advance further into the heart of the enemy\'s country; but with him and the force he has engaged to provide we could advance in safety and with certainty of success, especially as the enemy\'s attention is entirely engaged by the force marching against him on the main road from Cape Coast and Prahsu. I cannot help again repeating that the special commissioner and his subordinate officers deserve the utmost praise for the manner in which they have succeeded in bringing up their force of disciplined troops from the other side of the Volta, through Crubo, Aquapim, and Akim, across the Prah into Ashanti territory. Our whole force at present under arms in camp does not exceed 900 men. The native levies are exceedingly slow in their movements, and take their own time in all things. I have no doubt that if Captain Glover were to wait long enough, or until peace was declared, he might have a hundred thousand men under his command.

He had been trying by all possible means to bring the Juabins to serve under him again, but they refused.

He wanted to have all the chiefs again under his government; but he was told that the British Government is perfectly neutral in the matter; if the chiefs like to return, they may; but if not, they may remain as they are. He was very much annoyed and downcast at this decision, but there was no help for it. He was plainly told, should he go to war against Juabin, that Quocofoo, Mampon, and others would join them; and the result would be, that he would be dethroned and somebody else put in his place. After a good deal of palavering, he gave in, and Captain Lees, after much talk, got him to agree to the five following propositions:—\n\n1. The separation and independence of Juabin.\n2. That there must be general peace between all parties.\n3. That all prisoners in the possession of each party should be delivered, so that those who wish to return may do so.\n4. That roads to the interior be kept opened, and no party shall be molested whilst passing through for trade, &c.\n5. That all old quarrels are to be buried, and not to be raked up again.\n\nAfter the King had agreed to these, Captain Lees went to Juabin, saw the King and Chiefs, and then explained to them all the advantages they would obtain by this arrangement, which they finally agreed to accept. The King of Ashanti wanted them to come and eat fetish with him, or ratify the agreement in Kumasi; but the wily Juabins were too wide awake, and would not, as they said ""Koffee Carry Carry has got very bad fetish."" He, however, sent his messengers to the capital of Juabin, and the five propositions were ratified by the eating of fetish.', 'last_edit_date': '1874-08-31', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_09_1874#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE WOULD-BE ASHANTI ENVOYS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The steamer Accra arrived at Grand Canary on April 16, _en route_ for Liverpool, having on board the _soi-disant_ Ashanti Ambassadors, who are visiting England in the hope of waiting upon the Queen to lay before her Majesty a full statement of their case. The mission of these Envoys marks a stage in a series of negotiations. They are six in number, the chief amongst them being Prince A. A. Ossoo-Ansah, a son of Prince Ansah, who, in 1874, after the Ashanti War and the deposition of King Coffee, visited England for the purpose of clearing himself of imputations as to disloyalty to England during that war, and of obtaining compensation for the destruction of his property by the enemy. Prince Ossoo Ansah is the only one of the six who can speak English, and is appointed to act as interpreter and spokesman. The purpose of the visit has been stated in telegraphic despatches, but some fuller information is now available. It seems that the relations of Great Britain towards Ashanti have, with the sanction of the French Government, assumed somewhat new features, as it has been recognised as falling within the British sphere of influence. With the increased assurance of protection thus afforded, British traders have extended their operations in the country, which is extremely fertile in general produce, and especially rich in gold. The Governor of Cape Coast Castle, Sir W. Brandford Griffith, has consequently been led to propose the extension of British authority in a more formal manner—the establishment of a British Resident at the capital, Coomassie (or Kumasi). This step having been taken, the next would naturally be the definite conversion of the country into a British Protectorate. But to this idea a considerable number of the Natives have expressed the most decided objection; and it is with the idea of expressing the popular feeling upon this point that these six ""ambassadors"" have been appointed with the intention that they should seek an interview with the Queen, and lay before her Majesty the reasons why such a course would be so unpopular among their people.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-05-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_05_1895#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.72, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE MISSION TO KUMASI.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""In order to understand the revolution which is now occurring in Ashanti and the purpose of Captain Lee's mission to Kumasi, it will be necessary to consider for a moment the real nature of the kingdom which is or was governed by Calcalli, and if we trace it to its origin we find that about 200 years ago the Ashantees were a small tribe, vassals of Denkyera, then a powerful state, now part of our Protectorate. The Ashantees being ill-treated, rebelled, gained their independence, and founded Kumasi. They were surrounded by small kingdoms—Becqua, Kokofo, Mampom, Adansi, and Juabin—all of which they conquered; but these states still remained under their own kings, who paid tribute to the King of Ashanti, contributed soldiers when he went to war, attended the capital at certain festivals, and were summoned, as occasion arose, to councils, at which each chief or king spoke in turn, according to his rank. Thus it will be seen that the Ashanti nation was not homogeneous, but composed of various kingdoms which cherished the tradition of their independent sovereignty, which were held together more by the fear of punishment, and which were prepared at any time to secede from tyranny and taxation should any misfortune befall the imperial tribe. This seceding or separating process had already commenced before our troops were out of Ashanti. The Chief of Adansi and his people had been much oppressed by Ashanti. He resisted the white men, but as soon as Kumasi had been taken and the struggle decided he determined to throw off his ancient yoke and place himself in the hands of the stronger and also more merciful Power. He met Sir G. Wolseley in the ruins of Fomano, his own capital, and there made arrangements for migrating into the Protectorate. At the same time a rumour reached the General that the Chief or King of Becqua desired to follow the example of Adansi. Becqua is a powerful state, and its capital which our troops destroyed was not much smaller than Kumasi. Finally, the King of Juabin sent in his submission to Glorer, and afterwards began negotiations with the King of Eastern Akim, with a view to migration to that country. It seems that Becqua and Juabin have now determined to hold their own territory, to cast off their allegiance, and to resist any attempt that Calcalli may make to subdue them. Becqua is supported by Denkyera, and Juabin by Akim. Kumasi and its territory lie just between the rebellious states, and it is, to say the least, doubtful whether Kokofo and Mampom will assist the Ashantees, whose kingdom seems now reduced to its first elements—viz., a small tribe, a city which we may assume is not yet perfectly rebuilt, and a few plantation villages. It is, therefore, not surprising that the King should have sent to the white men for help. He says that he wants peace, and that war will be bad for trade; but as his messengers have passed without being molested through the Becqua territory, it is quite evident that these Becquas do not intend to be the aggressors. They were once free, they became slaves, and now they wish to be free again. Half a century ago, when Bowdich visited Kumasi, Juabin was an independent Power allied with Ashanti; and the early treaties with the English are in the joint names of Ashanti and Juabin. What more natural and laudable than that its chief should desire to regain the power which Ashantea craft and crime had taken from his ancestors? It is to be hoped that Calcalli will be made to understand that we do not deplore the misfortunes which his arrogance and exactions have brought upon himself, and that an attempt to subdue his rebellious vassals will meet with no sympathy from the British Government. A civil war in Ashanti would be injurious to trade, but it is not probable that the Ashantees will make war upon their neighbours. In the long run trade will certainly profit by the dissolution of the kingdom. If Ashanti had retained its ancient imperial power, war would have been the one occupation of that people, as it has been for the last 200 years. They might not have dared to invade the Protectorate, but they had plenty of other hunting grounds. Nor is it probable that the King would have ever made Ashanti a thoroughfare. Behind that country, to the north, are tribes rich in gold and cotton, who desire to reach the sea and trade with Europeans. It has always been the policy of Ashanti to check this enterprising spirit, and so to monopolize the trade. Kumasi was the *ne plus ultra* both for those who came from the north and those who came from the south; and so great was the dread of Ashanti among the neighbouring tribes, that I found in 1868, when I contemplated exploration from the Gold Coast and inspected the ground, it would be impossible to pass into the interior by any route between the Asini and the Volta without being arrested and sent to Kumasi. This cordon is now broken up, and it is probable that before very long the Germans and other tribes at the back of Ashanti will find their way down to the Coast.

B. Griffith, the Governor of the Gold Coast, arrived from Accra at Cape Coast Castle in the middle of November with an escort of 100 Houssa troops, under the command of Captain Aplin and Lieut. Cooper, with four field guns. The purpose of the Governor's visit was to hold a palaver with Prince John, the eldest brother of the King of Ashanti, who was expected daily from Coomassie. Prince John, with a large number of chiefs and 500 warriors, had then crossed the boundary between Ashanti and the Gold Coast, with the intention of embarking by the first steamer for England. The Governor had heard of this move on his part, and in order to prevent it travelled to Cape Coast Castle.\n\nNative traders reaching the coast from Coomassie have lately been constantly reporting that two Frenchmen were staying in the Ashanti capital, having travelled by way of Grand Bassam, and endeavouring to establish French influence. The reason of the visit of the Ashantis to the coast was that the British authorities had declared that if the King allowed French influence to predominate in his country he would be at once called upon to pay the balance of the war indemnity due to the British Government. The Ashantis object to pay this claim, and, with the exception of a few of the tribes, are opposed to a British protectorate; and it was in order to ventilate their views and to place them before the Queen that they intended to visit London. Concerning British action in the direction of Ashanti, the trade road, from Cape Coast to Prahsue, was surveyed in November for the purpose of establishing a telegraph and erecting a bridge over the river into Ashanti territory. This line might possibly be extended to Coomassie. It was reported that three British officials had been suggested as resident, doctor, and constabulary officer at Coomassie, with a suitable escort. There was also talk of constructing a railway from the coast to the Ashanti frontier, connecting with a main line from Accra along the coast to Axim Bay. On Nov. 19, the King of Beyin, who is subject to British rule, and whose country adjoins the French colony of Grand Bassam, asked for protection against the French, who were impressing his people to fight against a Chief with whom they were at war.

They are of the same family as the Fantees, and are superior to them in war merely because they are better disciplined and led. There is as little difference in manners and intelligence between them as there is in language, appearance, and dress. But I became acquainted some years ago with a native of Buntookoo, capital of Geman, four days' journey behind Ashanti. This man, a Moslem by religion, had slipped through to the Coast somehow or other, and used to give me, as we played draughts together, an account of his country, which is still a blank space on the maps. It is just such a country as I afterwards travelled in on the banks of the Niger. The inhabitants are Moslems for the most part, have schools and mosques, wage war on horseback, grow their own cotton and tobacco, have rich gold mines, which they work with industry, and live in large walled towns, with weekly markets, and governed as municipal communities. Compared with such a people, the Ashantees are squalling, throat-cutting savages, and it is this people they have always prevented from coming down to our settlements to trade. I, therefore, cannot believe that the breakup of Ashanti would be a misfortune; its power was always exercised more for evil than for good; its policy always was war, its traffic was chiefly in slaves, and the gold mines of the country were neglected. Captain Lees, who is probably now at Kumasi, is of all men on the Coast the one best adapted for this delicate and difficult mission. Formerly in the 23rd Regiment, he entered the Colonial Service and acted as Colonial Secretary at Lagos, where he became popular both with the natives and the merchants. While Sir G. Wolseley was marching on Kumasi Captain Lees was brought up from Lagos expressly to administer the Civil Government of the Gold Coast. Under the new régime instituted by Lord Carnarvon (whose scheme merits the highest praise) Captain Lees was appointed Administrator or Lieutenant-Governor of Lagos. He has, therefore, had much African experience, and also a natural gift for diplomacy. I do not doubt that he will succeed in establishing peace if it can be effected by skilful arbitration.

A most intelligent and trustworthy correspondent lately gave us, apropos of a desired tramway, some account of the rapid progress of palm-oil tree plantations in the Eastern district. All this, and a great deal more, seems, however, to be threatened, through that long indecision, that long delay in arriving at a wise decision, on the part of Earl Kimberley, of which we have ventured to complain. The existing danger is not a danger arising from any present military superiority of the Ashantis over the people of the Protected Territories. Under the, for a long time, efficacious protection of Great Britain, the population of those territories has so greatly increased since the time of the old Ashanti triumphs above alluded to, that we do not hesitate to say they are fully capable of their own protection and defence against Ashanti, if permitted to organize and act in their own way, and furnished with those supplies of arms and ammunition and other sinews of war, which it is the indisputable duty of the British Government, as the sole recipients of the customs revenues (the only revenues) to place at their disposal. And here the complete organization for defence against Ashanti, as projected and arranged by the Fanti Confederation, comes naturally before us once again for recommendation and insistence with Her Majesty's Government. Under actual British West African policy, as inaugurated after the decision of the House of Commons' Committee in 1865, such confederation, whether for eventual good (as we believe) or eventual evil, has become an absolute necessity of the position. This is no new assertion of ours. We have insisted on it again and again, no doubt to the disgust of the Colonial office. But it is the fault of Earl Kimberley, not our fault, that we are compelled again to reproduce the leading facts in our columns. After the ill-blown and disastrous Ashanti war bubble, which led to the sitting of the aforesaid Parliamentary Committee, the people of the Protected Territories were informed by the British authorities that in the future they must depend entirely on themselves as against Ashanti. Some arms and ammunition might be served out to them, and a British officer or two be lent to them - but nothing more. From that time the Home Government set resolutely to work to reduce the military expenditure on the West Coast. What remains for now some time past at Cape Coast and Accra, is nothing more than a mere guard for the sacred persons of the British authorities, and for the British flag which floats there. While thus, however, repudiating all obligation to defend, and withdrawing all their means for defending, they kept and keep within their own hand all power to direct the policy and negotiations of the territories as regards Ashanti; and as regarded the habitual allies of the Ashantis, the Dutch; as well as the whole public revenue of the country. Hence the treaty with Holland for exchange of territories, which, most unwisely, handed over towns to the Dutch without the consent of the people; and whole provinces which we had no power whatever to give, much less any shadow of right to give; and which opened to the traditional Ashanti enemy constant access to Elmina and other then Dutch coast towns. The kings, chiefs, and people saw the injustice and the danger, and met it boldly. Combined native forces assembled for operations against the Dutch. These operations led eventually to the sale by the Dutch of all their Gold Coast possessions to Great Britain. The assemblage of those combined native forces had in it the fruitful and vigorous germ of the Fanti Confederation, which became an acknowledged and influential fact during their progress. We have before claimed, and we claim again, for that Confederation the great victory of the entire withdrawal of the Dutch from the West Coast. Meanwhile the Ashantis—as the fruit of what ought to have been nipped in the bud at Addah by the British authorities at Cape Coast if they had been worth their salt as rulers—had laid waste whole districts in the extreme east of the territories, destroyed the cotton plantations and the people of Krepee, and committed all those other horrible excesses which uniformly attend their invasions. Was it likely, was it reasonable, that the kings and chiefs, alive to their constant peril on the side of Ashanti—long since forewarned that they must provide for their own defence; and seeing the Coast quite denuded (so far as regards all practical purposes connected with internal policy) of British troops—should dissolve their infant but provedly effective union, which had only been effected at the price of many mutual concessions; fold their arms in apathetic resignation, and deliver their throats to the Ashanti knife? It was neither likely, nor reasonable. What was likely and reasonable was, that they should endeavour to cement and extend their union; that they should organize it for internal administration and defence, under the friendly care of the British Government. They did this. The British authorities had often shown them that, before they could be regarded as a real organization, they must form something of a constitution, setting forth their objects, aims, and proposed means of action. This they did also. They met at Mankessim, joined and assisted by educated natives. They drafted and signed a Constitution, appointed officers, sent some of these latter, with the said Constitution, to be submitted to the British Coast authorities and the Colonial authorities at home, for their examination and approval. Then burst the storm. The Acting Administrator, Mr. Salmon, received the Fanti Confederation officials with a burst of ungovernable fury; refused to take and transmit the documents, charged the bearing officials with high treason, arrested and imprisoned them. He made the British Government to be like the dog in the manger—unable and unwilling to govern and defend the interior provinces, but at the same time determined that the Fanti Confederation, which could, and offered to do this, should not do it either. We do not intend here to re-state the persecutions and prosecutions which resulted from this dog-in-the-manger policy of an Administrator who was clearly unfit for the office he then filled, under circumstances that demanded a wise and prudent course of conduct. Immediately the atrocious folly came to our knowledge, we supplied Earl Kimberley with a copy of the Fanti Constitution, and detail of what had taken place, referring the whole matter to his consideration, and praying a speedy decision. Hitherto no such decision has been communicated. The territories remain without any effective native organization for their defence. The kings of some of the frontier provinces have therefore acted according to their own will. Hence the detention by them of the Ashanti chieftain, whose cruelties at Elmina and elsewhere had made him very odious to them; and, as a further consequence, the reported Ashanti inroad, with its usual atrocities and horrors. Both these are the direct results of the non-adoption of the Fanti Confederation by Earl Kimberley; while he has been at the same time carrying out the economic Government policy of the withdrawal of troops from the Coast. Had the Fanti Confederation been thus adopted, and its organization and action been approved and regulated by the British Government, the Confederation would have acted in accord with the British authorities as to the return of the Ashanti captain to his country. He would not have been detained as he has been, to the disgrace of the British authorities and the anger of the King of Ashanti. Nor this alone; but in addition, it is beyond doubt that the King of Ashanti would never have ventured an inroad into the Fanti countries had their organization for defence been approved and perfected. The so-called Protected Territories could only be a prey for the Ashantis when there existed division among their kings and chiefs, or some mere temporary rope of sand their union, ready to fall in pieces at the Ashanti touch. United, as they have sought to unite themselves, for general policy and combined action, with the assent of the British Government, they would be a power with which Ashanti could not cope. Unless the British Government has entirely changed its policy, and intends to undertake the military defence of the Protected Territories and their permanent internal administration, in defiance of the Parliamentary recommendation, it is imperatively called upon, by"", 'last_edit_date': '1873-01-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_01_1873#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""Mr. Gladstone's Declaration on the Ashanti War"", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'we shall, I hope, seek to draw from what has happened a lesson on the duty of avoiding in future the first entrance into equivocal and entangling engagements. Meantime, we repose the utmost confidence in the British General, officers, and soldiers; and we cherish the hope that we are about to emerge at an early date, and on good terms, from the conflict."" The address from which this extract is taken, is one of great power and intense interest, shadowing forth, as it does, changes of extreme importance to the whole British community, and which must influence materially the future destinies of the country. Nor have we any fault to find with the above observations relative to the Ashanti War, except in the paragraphs as to ""the establishment of friendship with the Ashantees,"" and ""the duty of avoiding in future the first entrance into equivocal and entangling engagements."" The latter is a fine phrase, meaning nothing, and copied out of Mr. Bright\'s textbook—a bad volume for a Minister to study as regards foreign relations. Should equivocal and entangling engagements appear to be necessary in the future, for forwarding some great object of Imperial policy, they will be entered into then as they have been entered into in the past. One unacquainted with the history of our connection with the Gold Coast countries, would imagine that, by some act of official stupidity, we had recently entered into engagements which had led to this Ashanti War. Nothing can be farther from the truth. Our engagements with the Gold Coast at this time—those engagements which have forced us into the present Ashanti War—are the unavoidable legacy of the foreign slave trade we ruthlessly carried on there for more than a century, and the efforts since made by the conscience-stricken British nation to put a final end to that abominable traffic. We were thus naturally led to, and detained on, the Gold Coast. We could not remain there without being supreme, and asserting and exercising our supremacy. In the exercise of this supremacy, we became naturally the protectors of the Gold Coast against enemies by sea or land. We consequently took upon ourselves the direction of its external relations, among the chief of which were those with Ashanti; and if there is now a war between us and Ashanti, that war is not the result of Fantee action, nor of ""our having entered into equivocal engagements,"" but of a culpable neglect and mismanagement on our part, the responsibility for which does not attach to the present Administration alone, but to many successive Administrations, which have chosen to shut their eyes to, and take no efficient measures to prevent, results which every unofficial person connected with those countries could foresee. Then, as regards friendship with Ashanti, as a result of the present advance on Kumasi. Should the Ashanti power survive the victory which we are bound to obtain over it at whatever cost, there could not be any friendship between it and us, except by a total change in its principles, customs, and character. Kumasi is a charnel-house, a slaughter-pen, where the blood of innocent human victims is incessantly flowing. Hitherto we have not been responsible for this, save that by a national effort, such as Ashanti has now forced upon us, we might have put an end to it. But if we entered into relations with it (after having conquered it) that would re-establish and perpetuate it, we should be responsible, and guilty as a nation, before God and man. Friendship between light and darkness is not less impossible than friendship, under such circumstances, between Christian Britain and the Ashanti which has been known of up to this present time. But our own opinion, expressed at the commencement of the present operations, and which we still retain, is that there will not be any danger of our falling into such a snare of guilty complicity with a murderous superstition, because the Ashanti power, losing all its prestige by our successful advance on Kumasi, will fall in pieces. It has only existed hitherto through the mutual jealousies of divers people, whom it has played one against another, while using them all for its aggressive operations. We may be mistaken; but this, we repeat, is our confirmed opinion; and it will be well for the Administration of which Mr. Gladstone is the head that this contingency should be maturely considered, in order that they may be able to deal in the most advantageous manner with the emergency should it arise.', 'last_edit_date': '1874-01-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_01_1874#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE ASHANTI KINGDOM', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—There are two passages in the very interesting account which you published on the 29th ult. of the King and people of Ashanti of great importance in relation to this war:—\n\n1.

Rightly refused it may be, because, no doubt, his surrender would have been quickly followed by his execution. But if extradition treaties are the rule of the day between civilized nations, the King of Ashanti is clearly as well entitled to some arrangement which shall prevent robbers of his revenue finding protection among the Fantis.\n\n2.

It appeared to them to be a great pity that our Government should have retired as they did in 1872 without doing anything for the development of the trade there. It was most important for the development of trade and the civilisation of the Natives that we should remain in the country and administer it along with the Gold Coast Colony. We had the French on one side and Germany on the other. He did not want to remark on the administration of either of these countries, but he wished to point out in regard to the hinterland that two or three years ago an expedition, strongly supported by that Chamber, practically annexed the hinterland of Lagos, and since then trade had enormously increased. A new industry in rubber had been started, which promised to attain large dimensions, and the interior was now under an administration of such a character as secured the lives and property of the Natives. They wanted the same thing to be done in connexion with the hinterland of the Gold Coast Colony, and not merely a resident in Coomassie to see that justice was administered in Ashanti.\n\nMr. A. L. Jones seconded the resolution. He thought the present a very suitable time to urge upon the Government the desirability of taking over Ashanti. Nothing could be more ridiculous than the way in which we had dealt with Ashanti in the past. Twenty years ago we sent an expedition there, on which we spent nearly one million sterling, and then we went away and left the place. Now that Mr. Chamberlain was giving attention to British interests in various parts of the world, the present was a very opportune time to press forward the question of the annexation of Ashanti. He knew from a number of officials that such a step was most desirable. These officials held the opinion that the place must absolutely be annexed before they could do any good. The country behind the Gold Coast was a very valuable one, but at present there was no protection for anyone to trade there. He believed we would be conferring a great blessing upon the people of Ashanti if we annexed that country. They had seen what could be done in these regions in the way of developing trade by what had taken place in the hinterland of Lagos, and he was sure they would have exactly the same result in the hinterland of the Gold Coast if we had Ashanti freed from the Native rule, which was interested in every way in keeping down the people.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-01-10', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_02_1896#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Eighteen Hundred and Seventy-four', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""It is not often that years so fulfil the promises of their early days, and the hopes born of those promises, as the year One Thousand Eight Hundred and Seventy-four has done.

In our retrospect, it is not alone from a West African point of view that we have to regard—we have to look also from a Christian and an Imperial one; and from one and all we find cause of rejoicing and of praise. When writing in December, 1873, we had before us the fact of almost matured preparations on the Gold Coast for a march into Ashanti, within the territory of which all that remained of a late invading army had withdrawn. The Prah was to be crossed on the first days of the new year, provided the important question of supplies for the advancing army could be satisfactorily solved.

With us it was a foregone conclusion that if the army could, and was allowed to, advance, there was no enemy, however naturally brave, that could successfully withstand it—there were no obstacles that it could not overcome—there was no resisting power that could survive the British hostile impact. There was, perhaps, a slight tinge of fear on our thoughts that temporary political considerations might triumph over Imperial and West African interests—that some overtures might be made by the enemy, and fatally accepted, with a view to the announcement at the meeting of the Imperial Parliament that the Gold Coast operations had successfully terminated, and our forces were on their homeward march. The tinge, however, was but slight and transient. We had faith in the ignorant obstinacy of the Ashantees; and that faith was fully justified. The enemy slipped away from all the encouragements offered him to propose or accept suitable terms of accommodation. The British forces, with their few dependable and effective African allies, advanced, fought, conquered, and took and burnt Kumasi. The Ashanti power was thenceforth at an end, as we had always felt convinced that it would be. The King thought to free himself from his difficulties and recover his lost prestige by sundry diplomatic wrigglings; but the fatal word of High Heaven's decree, had been traced on the smouldering ruins of his hideously blood-stained capital, and no earthly power nor earthly blunder could efface or revoke it. As M. Bonnat, the French prisoner of three or four years at Kumasi, has very justly and correctly expressed it, the Ashantees, according to African ideas and customs, now considered that they belonged to the conqueror. He had overcome them; they were henceforth his, and their only wonder would be his declining to avail himself to the fullest extent of his rights by conquest. That the conqueror has not yet done so, we deplore; that he will yet find it necessary, and be therefore compelled to do so, we do not hesitate to affirm. Ashanti—all the combined and tributary states and kingdoms known under that name, from the Prah to the summits of the Kong Mountains and to the frontier of Dahomey—belongs, according to all native African precedent and ideas, to Great Britain; and she may effectively possess, rule, and govern it whenever it may seem good in her eyes for her to do so. As Great Britain has declined for the present to interfere among the lately combined kings and tributaries, further than to advise them to be at peace one with another, they have, according to our this month's advices, deposed their King, Koffee Kalkalli, who has submitted to a decree he had not the power to resist. They are now endeavouring to form combinations for a new general organization; but any such organization in native Africa, that has no power to surround itself with the prestige of great military success, is but a rope of sand. We scarcely need say that if we could have our will, Great Britain would not confine herself to the mere rôle of unimpassioned observer and occasional adviser at so important a time as the present. She has the power to shape the future course and rule the future destinies of those countries. Unsought, unwished for, God has given them into her hand; and it is her duty to fulfil the trust thus confided to her. While that issue was being fought out in Ashanti, a series of unexpected occurrences led to a change of the occupants of political power in Great Britain. The Government who had made the Ashanti War had passed away in their hour of victory, and Lord Kimberley was succeeded by Lord Carnarvon. The Gold Coast War had brought into prominence many facts before unknown or disregarded, or wilfully ignored; and the new Ministry comprehended that West African affairs, after such Imperial sacrifices as had been made in the late war, could no longer be allowed to drift as they had heretofore done, no one knowing or caring whither. Since it was determined that we could not cease to occupy, it was also determined that we must govern, and must have some distinct and comprehensible policy.

It wielded undisputed economic and political power over the coast and over the dependent kingdoms to the north. Towards the centre, kingdoms associated with the Oyoko clan from Kumasi gradually became subjugated and tributary on account of structural reforms carried out by Osei Kodjo, first, in the kingdom of Kumasi, and then at the expense of the neighbouring Akan kingdoms: Mampong, Nsuta, Dwaben, Bekwai, Kokofu, Bono, as also Denkyira, Ahafo, Sefwi, Adansi, etc. In this region, the Kumasihene (king of Kumasi) became the Asantehene. From this base, the Asante dynasty held political and economic sway over the coastal kingdoms (Wassa, Nzima, Twifu, Akwamu, Akyem, Akuapem, Ga and Adangbe), and more especially the coastal strip of the Fante chief› taincies. Similarly, to the north, the kingdoms of Gyaman, Gonja, Dagomba and Mamprusi came under the sway of Asante, sanctioned by a yearly tribute (ayibuade) of two thousand slaves, especially after the 1794 treaty.\nThe nineteenth century was to start with the reign of one of the greatest of the Asantehenes, Osei Bonsu (1801-24), whose victorious armies pushed through to the coast in a series of campaigns (1807, 1811 and 1814). The British, who at the time were caught up in the Napoleonic Wars and had no clear policy for their Gold Coast settlements, could not but recognize, through the President of the Council of Merchants, Colonel Torrane, and his successors, the reality of the suzerainty, or even sovereignty, of Asante over all the coastal peoples.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Patterns of authority', 'content': ""Kano and Bunafu thus represented two different models of the way in which the power structure affected agricultural development in Africa in the early nineteenth century, one where authority was centralized and structured, the other where it was diffuse and informal.

Thus, Mwanga was adept at the diplomatic game of divide and rule, a tactic which the colonizing powers were able to use so effectively in controlling Africa.

There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler.

His influence through all the troubled times of Uganda had done much to ensure the safety of British communications with the east coast'.$^{20}$ The same sentiments were echoed by another colonial official on the occasion of Mumia's death in 1949.

The more they alienated their people by the enforcement of such measures, the more they were forced to rely on missionaries.\nIn fact the connection these kings had with the missionaries lay at the heart of their resistance through diplomacy to those who sought to dis› possess them of their lands.

In some ways Makana's teaching was an African version of the Protestant Christian ideology of sovereignty, which later gave Wittboi confidence in the divine right of the Red Captains. Makana explored the fundamental differences between black and white - different customs, different divinities, different destinies. The creator was Dali'dephu, great ancestor of the Xhosa, who had made Uthixo to be the god of the white men. Uthixo was an inferior to Dali'dephu, and the white men were morally the inferior of the Xhosa - continually vexed with the idea of sin. But this difference did not matter until the two moral universes came into contact and into conflict; then Dali'dephu would assert himself to ensure that his own particular children, the Xhosa, and their own particular and superior way of life triumphed over the super› ficial powers of the whites. Makana appealed for pan-Xhosa unity; for confidence in their moral universe. Dali'dephu would sweep the whites away; the Xhosa dead would return; 'a new era would begin'. 26 Conceptual and symbolic innovations such as Makana's had a relevance which long outlasted the particular resistance with which they were first associated. So far from being desperate nonsense, prophetic messages of this kind were a systematic attempt to widen and redefine the idea of deity and its relation to the moral order, and involved wide-ranging changes in Xhosa internal assumptions and relationships as well as providing the 'bedrock of ideology for resistance'. Peter Rigby has argued strongly against the idea that African prophetism was 'merely the result of exogenous forces of disruption during the colonial period' or sprang 'from a breakdown of African religions'.

The first treaty was that of 1873, which gave Ja Ja power to fine all European traders who attempted to trade beyond certain defined limits in his territory. The treaty of 1884, concluded after the Berlin Congress, established a protectorate over Opobo. All went well until 1886, when, trade in palm oil being depressed, traders wished to get rid of the middlemen and trade directly beyond the districts opened to Europeans in Opobo. To this King Ja Ja objected. Consul Hewitt had assured him that by the protectorate the Queen did not want to take his country or his markets; that she had no wish to disturb his rule. Nevertheless, because King Ja Ja refused to allow the European traders to break the express terms of his treaty by trading directly in the reserved region, he has been first fined, then his trade has been destroyed, and lastly, he has been arrested under circumstances of great treachery by Consul Johnston, and carried off a prisoner to the Gold Coast.

The countries on the sea-coast are divided into districts, to each of which a Commissioner is appointed by the Governor. The interior countries, however, are not thus provided for, but are left to be ruled by their chiefs and kings, as formerly. The authority of these kings and chiefs was not formally acknowledged, and any offence which, according to custom, is visited with severe punishment, is immediately reported to the Government authorities on the sea-coast; and the chieftain or king who ordered the punishment is brought before the Court and treated as the commonest fellow.\n\nThis action on the part of the Government terrifies and paralyzes a good many of these chiefs and kings, so that in a great many instances the wicked go unpunished. On the other hand, others use the name of the Government to acquire territories which they have not the least right to. Amongst these I may mention the name of one ""Sakiaty,"" who is of great notoriety in Eastern Croboe, interior of Accra. This man was a chief of Odumase, a country of Eastern Croboe, before the Ashanti Campaign, but immediately after the war, he assumed the authority and title of king, which he said was vested in him by Sir John Glover for the valuable services he rendered in the war. Not contented with the throne which he has thus usurped, he is now intriguing to acquire Western Croboe also. The present king of Western Croboe, who is now being molested, forbears to say anything, lest his opposition may end in a contest, and he may be thereby brought to the sea-coast and treated with ignominy. But there is sure to come a successor who will dispute every inch of ground that ""Sakiaty"" has thus acquired. This will undoubtedly end in strife, when people will have the mortification again to see that their royalties are treated contemptuously by those who are their protectors. If the present system of government in the interior countries is to continue, I would, Sir, respectfully recommend that the following plans be carried out: (1) that every chieftain or king in the interior should prove his claim; (2) that the right of government by native chiefs and kings in the interior, so far as it is compatible with common sense and humanity, be proclaimed as supported by the British authorities on the sea-coast; and (3), that any unnecessary interference and aggression of one chief or king with another, be met with the highest displeasure of the Governor.', 'last_edit_date': '1880-06-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_08_1880#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Letters to the Editor: The Arrest of King Ja Ja', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'SIR,—I note in some of the daily newspapers an announcement of the arrest of King Ja Ja, of Opobo, West Africa, by the British Consul, on account of his disregard of certain trade obligations.

One of the conditions of the treaty which Ja Ja signed (Article 6) expressly prohibited strangers going to the interior markets; this condition being further substantiated by a letter from the Consul to Ja Ja; the effect and intention of this being to secure that the European agents should only obtain their goods from the interior through Ja Ja and his chiefs.\n\nAbout two years ago, owing to the depression in the oil trade, some of these agents agreed among themselves that the price of the oil and other native productions should be reduced; and Ja Ja accordingly was communicated with upon the subject, and he expressed his readiness to accept their terms; but that the ""topside"" (a general term among the traders there, meaning commission) should be allowed to him and his chiefs, as before. This the agents would not agree to; they were willing to continue the usual topside to Ja Ja himself, but not to his chiefs. Ja Ja remonstrated with them, and pointed out that Opobo was made by himself and his chiefs. Immediately a white flag was hoisted in five of the factories, which meant that they stop all further business with the natives.

At this custom all the royal maidens are required to fetch water from the sacred streams of Golutar. This water is sprinkled in the royal mausoleum, after which sacrifices of sheep and oxen are made by the fetish priest, followed by a human sacrifice, the victim being commissioned to convey messages to the spirits of the deceased kings, and to invoke their guidance and protection for the throne and kingdom. The chiefs, in support of the foregoing, assert that of the 4,000 Yorubas captured in the last raid at Abeokuta four years ago, not one has been offered in sacrifice, and that it is a capital offence to shed human blood in Dahomey, and also that any chief or prince who would cause one of his servants to be beaten so that he fainted would be imprisoned for life.

When the King denied having been a party to this, Mahabah\'s life was in danger, the King declaring that since Mahabah was a friend of the British, and they had been satisfied with his statement relative to peace, it must have been he who encouraged the British to make war.

In this strait, Mahabah sallied from the town with his followers, gave battle to the Badiboos, defeated them, took their King prisoner, beheaded him, pursued the fugitives through the kingdoms of Barra and Salem, and even called upon the King of Keyang, on the other side of the river, to destroy those who had fled thither for protection.\n\nThis is at least a clear and intelligible statement, such as we were quite unable to extract from preceding accounts.

One was a celebrated slavetrader, now dead; the other an equally well-known native merchant. The King of Dahomey, on a certain occasion, expressed a curiosity to ascertain the exact appearance presented by an infant whilst in the womb, and in order to gratify that diabolical curiosity, this religious monarch ordered one of his female subjects who was in an advanced state of pregnancy to be brought before him. I cannot write what followed, as it would be too disgusting; but suffice it to say, that the King, having satisfied his curiosity, exclaimed, ""Is that all?"" There are those still living that can corroborate this. Now, I should say that one whose religion would not deter him from committing a crime which I believe to be unparalleled would not hesitate to order the slaughter of any number of his helpless dependents.

According to the estimate of Colonel Grant, who was his guest twenty-three years ago, M\'tesa was probably not more than forty-eight years of age at the time of his death, and, having succeeded his father, Suna, in 1857, he has reigned twenty-eight years. The Waganda have the names of thirty-five kings who have reigned down to the time of M\'tesa in regular succession, and this, as Colonel Grant points out, may probably account for the ""blue blood"" and vanity which certainly ran in the veins of M\'tesa. Probably, however, no other native African prince has been able to organize a state so completely and make so great an advance towards civilization as the King who has just died. Colonel Grant, who knew him well, speaks of him in terms of real respect, and his estimate is supported by Sir Samuel Baker and Mr. Stanley. As we know, the result of Mr. Stanley\'s visit was that missions were established in the country, which have had gratifying success. But M\'tesa was much perplexed when he learned that there are two Christian religions, the adherents of which are as hostile to each other as both are to Mahomedanism or heathenism. Doubtless from the European point of view M\'tesa was guilty of great cruelties; but these apparently indiscriminate sacrifices of human life were really the recognized and organized modes of administering justice in Uganda. M\'tesa himself was evidently a man governed largely by impulse. When Baker was all but defeated by the Wanyoro, a force from Uganda arriving in the distance was the cause of the dispersion of the enemy. M\'tesa forwarded letters from Baker to Livingstone by his swift-footed soldiers, who, after a journey of 600 miles, found the veteran traveller was dead. These and other facts show that M\'tesa was capable of taking a real interest in matters far outside the range of the ordinary savage mind. His army, wonderfully organized and disciplined, Mr. Stanley estimates at 125,000 men, and his fleet at 500 canoes. The population of Uganda proper is probably about 1,000,000, but, with neighbouring dependent territories, about 3,000,000. The capital is finely situated on the slopes of the north shore of Lake Victoria Nyanza. It is gratifying to learn that there have been comparatively little violence and bloodshed at the change of monarchy. It used to be the custom at the coronation for a new king to sacrifice his brothers—a custom which the latter evidently regarded as perfectly natural. M\'tesa\'s brothers, at the time of Colonel Grant\'s visit, went about in chains, but all the same, and though conscious of their fate, ""conversed and attended picnics, and boated, and played musical instruments with their brother, the King, with perfect freedom of action and of speech.""

This context challenges the notion of purely religious motivations in resistance movements, emphasizing a blend of political, cultural, and religious factors. In contrast, The African Times articles offer detailed accounts supporting the claim that Quaku Duah was an absolute and despotic monarch who frequently used violence to assert control, including ordering executions and mass killings for personal gain or amusement, rather than religious duty. While the articles acknowledge that some actions were influenced by local beliefs, they largely depict Quaku Duah's rule as characterized by absolute power and violent methods, challenging the idea that his actions were purely religiously motivated. Together, these sources highlight the complexity of motivations behind leadership actions in the Ashantee context, blending political, cultural, and religious elements.","The General History of Africa textbook does not provide specific information about Quaku Duah, the King of Ashantee, or his use of absolute power, violence, and destruction to assert control.

This uprising was not purely religiously motivated but was a defense of political sovereignty and cultural identity. The text also highlights the role of religious ideas in resistance movements across Africa, suggesting that while religious motivations were significant, they were often intertwined with political and cultural factors. Therefore, the textbook does not directly support or refute the claim about Quaku Duah, but it does provide context that challenges the notion of purely religious motivations in resistance, emphasizing a blend of political, cultural, and religious factors.

What they have found bears little resemblance either to the \'fanatical witch-doctors\' of colonial reports, or to \'the magic of despair\'. They have found, to begin with, that religious teachings and symbols often bore very directly on the question of sovereignty and legitimacy. Rulers were legitimized through ritual recognition, and when a ruler and his people determined to defend their sovereignty they naturally drew heavily on religious symbols and ideas. Rodney, in a paper on Ovimbundu resistance in Angola, remarks that \'a great deal of attention has been paid to spiritual resistance in a later stage of the African struggle notably in cases like the Maji Maji wars ... but for ""primary resistances"" there is a tendency to under-emphasize the fact that African peoples every› where automatically resisted not only in material terms but also with their own metaphysical religious weapons.\' 21 In another paper, this time on the resistance of the Gaza state to the Portuguese in southern Mozambique, Rodney writes of the possible traumatic consequences of the commitment of spiritual resources to the struggle. \'The Ngoni of Gaza suffered not only the destruction of their political capital but also the defilement of their principal shrine\'; after military defeat in 1895 the royal ritual objects were lost; diviners threw away their divining bones after the incomprehensible event of defeat; the \'high priestess\' was dismissed and executed. \'Awareness of crisis at a deep spiritual level was quite widespread.\' 22 It was,out of crises of legitimacy of this sort that the great movements which attempted to redefine sovereignty often emerged. Such movements almost invariably had the advantage of spiritual leaders, enunciating the message of wider unity. Sometimes this sort of development took place in the context of Islam - and Islamic ideologies of millennialism and resistance spread right across the Sudanic belt from east to west. Some› times it happened because of the influence of Christian ideas - and Hendrik Wittboi drew upon Protestant Christianity for his doctrine of sovereignty, while an African independent Christian prophet was active among the Nama at the time of their rising against the Germans.

But the last straw that really precipitated action was the demand of the British governor, Arnold Hodgson, for the Golden Stool to be sent to him so that he could sit on it. The Golden Stool was the most sacred object of the Asante, which they considered as the embodiment of their soul and a symbol of their survival as a nation. That demand, therefore, could not but touch off an instantaneous rebellion of nearly all the principal states under the leadership of the Queen of Edweso, Nana Yaa Asantewaa (see Plate 6.2). 64 The Asante forces attacked the Governor and his party who had to seek refuge in the fort at Kumasi which the Asante then besieged. When the governor and his party escaped from the fort, the Asante fought several pitched battles with the British which lasted from April to November 1900 when Yaa Asantewaa was arrested and deported with other Asante generals to the Seychelles.\nSimilar revolts, pitched battles and guerrilla warfare raged in the Ivory Coast in response to the brutal methods including forced labour and high taxation used by that cruel Governor, Angoulvant, for the consolidation of French rule and the exploitation of the colony.

In some ways Makana's teaching was an African version of the Protestant Christian ideology of sovereignty, which later gave Wittboi confidence in the divine right of the Red Captains. Makana explored the fundamental differences between black and white - different customs, different divinities, different destinies. The creator was Dali'dephu, great ancestor of the Xhosa, who had made Uthixo to be the god of the white men. Uthixo was an inferior to Dali'dephu, and the white men were morally the inferior of the Xhosa - continually vexed with the idea of sin. But this difference did not matter until the two moral universes came into contact and into conflict; then Dali'dephu would assert himself to ensure that his own particular children, the Xhosa, and their own particular and superior way of life triumphed over the super› ficial powers of the whites.

Jules Gerard, who *is* acquainted with him, is what we, who are ""so mentally poor,"" cannot conceive.\n\nThose who are really familiar with the subjects upon which ""An African"" displays such profound ignorance will perceive at a glance that what he essays to describe is not, as he asserts, from actual experience gained by him on the Coast, but has been related to him by one only a shade better acquainted therewith than himself. All his information respecting Badahung and Dahomey was obtained from the master of an English brig trading between the Gold Coast and Whydah, who again derived his from no less a personage than Badahung\'s friend and agent at Whydah, the celebrated slaver dealer, Senhor Domingo José Martinez. Those who have the pleasure of that gentleman\'s acquaintance are well aware that he is not the kind of person to expose the secrets of his friend the King (I don\'t mean *friend* to\n\nthe light that ""An African"" does) to one who he knew was purposely fishing for information for an English Government official. Therefore, those who choose to accept such as is obtained in this manner must make up their minds to be served with an article not quite genuine.\n\nI have reason to be quite certain that it was from this source that the erroneous information respecting Dahomey was obtained which was published last year in a letter addressed to the *Times*; and there is more than very strong presumptive and circumstantial evidence to justify the public in identifying this pseudo-African with the author of that letter, as well as of another published in the same journal in December last, relative to the mutiny of the Gold Coast Artillery, and signed ""Africanus.""'}, {'id': 4741, 'article_title': 'Massacre in Ashanti', 'full_section_title': 'Massacre in Ashanti', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1883#article-9', 'issue_date': '01_12_1883', 'content': 'Owosucorcor having managed to get Quacoe Duah on the throne, is now endeavouring to make his name a terror.

Laing, both of whom are still in the land of the living. I have the permission of one of these living and trustworthy witnesses to state that nothing of the kind ever occurred at any interview between the King and the Governor, and the one never met the other but in the presence of the two missionaries; and at that particular interview during which the subject of human sacrifices was brought on the tapis, the King and the Governor were seated at least fifteen yards apart; so that it would have been impossible for the former to touch with his finger the *left* (how suspiciously precise) epaulet of the latter without rising from his seat.

The news he brings is truly distressing. Quacoe Duah, the aged King of that extraordinary country, is really dead. He died suddenly, and was found dead in his bed on the 27th April, 1867. No one knew of the king's death but the principal Ocrah in the palace, and as the principal chiefs went to pay their accustomed respects to their sovereign they were all seized, the door locked, and everyone was slaughtered there and then to accompany the king to the other world. Of course this was a grand signal for the commencement of the decapitation, and for weeks on an average there were forty human beings killed per day.\n\nThe Princes of Ashantee went about shooting, stabbing, and otherwise butchering any one they met in the streets or in houses. I am happy, however, to say that Prince Ansah assured me he did not imbrue his hands in human blood, although he could if he had liked, and in fact he was expected to do his share, but he wisely and creditably declined the honour, and in giving me a history of the fearful doings at Ashantee, he appeared to be as horrified as I was at the barbarities he was forced to gaze on. Two instances of great devotion were displayed by two of the late king's wives; they followed the procession to the grave, and as their lord the king was placed in his sepulchre, they drank bowls of poison and threw themselves alongside of him. The rest of his wives were decapitated by force. The prince informs me that the stench in Kumasi was dreadful, and he was glad to get away from the horrors that surrounded him. The King Quacoe Duah had reigned thirty-seven years, the longest reign known in Ashantee. He is succeeded by his nephew, named Coffee Culcary, who has ascended the throne of his uncle, the late King, and is about thirty-five years old. He is very fond of Prince John Osso Ansah, and it is to be hoped the Government will see the desirability of encouraging the Prince in frequent visits to Kumasi, so that he may by his experience of European manners and customs induce his less fortunate relations in Kumasi to imitate and practise them.

He was chiefly known to Englishmen as the Ashantee general who was sent down to the coast by the then King with the golden axe as a present for our Queen on the occasion of what was known as the Ashanti War scare three years ago. In honour of the funeral of Quacow Duah, 300 of his subjects were killed.

The successor to the throne will, it is supposed, be Mensah, who was king up to a few months ago, but who was deposed on account of his barbarous cruelties. In view of the terror which this belief has inspired, the Ashantee chiefs have sent a deputation to the Governor of Cape Coast Castle, asking that their country shall be annexed to the British protectorate.

There I could hear nothing but the war cry. Every man I approached on the subject of Christianity would answer me something about the war. I said to a great many persons that they ought to throw away their gods, serve the Great God, and become Christians, but they would generally say, ""We will see about it after the war is over."" The great multitudes scorn the cause of Christ, and serve their idols. I went with a friend to Porto Novo, a city about the same distance from Lagos as Abeokuta. The city and its country have a population of 90,000. Soon after our arrival we went to salute the King (Tofa). We found him to be a very intelligent-looking man. We told him that we came to see if he would allow us to come and live in his country, build a school and chapel, and teach his people the Christian\'s religion. He said he only knew two religions—viz., the Wesleyans and Catholics; those were enough, and he wanted no other religion in his country. We attempted to tell him that we all taught the same religion, but he soon stopped us by saying, ""I have no more to say on the subject."" He is a great tyrant, and much devoted to his gods. Just a few days before we went there he sacrificed twenty human souls to his gods. He has about three hundred wives, and told us that he had a very strict law, which prohibited us speaking to any woman or girl, as they were all his wives there. When we meet a woman or girl, we must give half of the walk and not touch them. He had a bottle of beer and lemonade brought for us to drink. After a little more talk we took a glass of lemonade and left with the understanding that we could look at his town if we let the women pass. On leaving his palace we noticed in his yard some half-dozen or more gods. These gods are to be seen by the thousands. Many of the heathen temples are decorated with human skulls, which have been offered as sacrifices to the gods. In one of these temples I counted as many as thirteen. I saw a dog that had been killed, no doubt as a sacrifice, and tied to the neck of one of the gods in the market. A German merchant there had one of the native boys to steal some money from him. He took him to the King to be punished for the deed. The King said, ""All right; I will try by one of my gods; if I find him to be guilty I will punish him."" The merchant said, ""I don\'t believe in your fetishes."" ""What,"" said the King, ""you don\'t believe in my gods!

We need scarcely add that had this want of unity between Agiman and Attah been prevented in time, the Ashantees would not have dared to make any such pretensions, much less to strike a blow, seeing that they understand very well the strength of the whole Akim in unity.

A brief skirmish followed in which the Ansßr achieved a quick and easy victory, and the administration was thrown into utter confusion. The Mahdï and his followers considered their victory to have been a miracle. 23 The Mahdfs political foresight and his military genius was clearly reflected in his decision to 'emigrate' after this encounter from Abä to Djabal Kadir in the Nuba mountains. Apart from being another parallel with the life of the Prophet, this hidjra moved the revolution from an open and defenceless area that was within reach of the government's forces to a remote and strategically fortified region. This hidjra was indeed a turning-point in the history of the Mahdiyya. Its main significance was that in moving the revolution from the riverain regions to the western Sudan, the westerners thenceforward became its key administrators and military commanders, while the riverain people in the movement declined in significance. 24 Another turning-point in the history of the Mahdist revolution was the battle at Shaykän on 5 November 1883.

Many of the Lunda and Shona states had also undergone a process of political fractionalization. North of the Zambezi, the slave trade intensified internal rivalries in the kingdoms of the Lunda of Kazembe, Undi, Kalonga and Lundu that left them vulnerable to the seditious activities and attacks of the slave traders and their Nguni counterparts. To the south, cleavages within the Shona aristocracy, coupled with the devastating raids of the Zwangendaba and Gaza Nguni, substantially weakened the regional powers. The incursions of Zwangendaba, for example, are generally credited with destroying the badly divided Rozwi kingdom of Changamire, while the division of the Barue state into two competing factions, coupled with the debilitating Gaza raids, enabled the Goan adventurer Gouveia to usurp temporarily the Barue throne around 1875. 97 Gouveia's success was part of a larger process by which Yao, ArabSwahili, Chikunda and Nguni invaders took advantage of the power vacuum to impose conquest states. While these new military states were undoubt› edly stronger than the polities they had vanquished, the subject peoples often perceived them as alien interlopers and resented their authoritarian rule. As a result, the leaders were compelled to intensify their coercive practices, which heightened the level of hostility and increased the fre› quency of insurrections. The revolts of the lakeside Tonga, Tumbuka and Henga against the Mbwela Nguni, and of the Tonga and Chopi against the Gaza, demonstrate the growing antipathy of the oppressed. A similar spirit of defiance motivated the Tawara and Tonga to periodically challenge the Afro-Portuguese and their Chikunda allies, who had carved out large territorial holdings along the southern margin of the Zambezi. The Swahili ruler, who governed the coastal sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona, faced similar opposition. Such animosity did not lend itself to a unified struggle against the Europeans.

He seems to consider that the chief Mahabah is performing a duty which the Government neglected to do, and for doing which it envies the man who is really performing very important public services, and preparing the way for the progressive civilization of the country. That man, Mahabah, he says, is not seeking his own interests only, but that of all British subjects. British merchants have been without any real, efficient protection in the river of late years, and Mahabah has made a vast improvement in this respect during the last 24 months. It is true, he proceeds, that, partly owing to the war, and partly to the famine that prevailed during the rainy season, there has been a great deficiency of produce, ""but it is far better to prepare the ground before sowing seed, than to sow it in unprepared soil."" The Pagsoos, in this river, are a people that do not work, but who go about plundering those who do work; pillaging the merchants and traders, and committing many other and great enormities. They are, in fact, a lazy, predatory, and degraded people. The late war between the British and Badiboo was caused by such deeds as are above alluded to. The British effected really nothing, but Mahabah has made an entire change. These people, before so troublesome, having been brought by him under subjection, are now learning to depend on their own labour for the means of support; so that British merchants, who previously scarcely dared to commission any traders in that part, have now been able to find employment as traders there for those who have been (so arbitrarily, as he contends) dismissed from the Government service.'}, {'id': 1119, 'article_title': 'Gold Coast', 'full_section_title': 'Gold Coast', 'last_edit_date': '05-07-1867', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_06_1867#article-4', 'issue_date': '22_06_1867', 'content': 'Governor Blackall has ""settled"" the Awoonlah palaver, and ""made peace"" with the Awoonlahs, without paying the slightest regard to any of the suggestions offered to him here; a peace made with our enemies without our concurrence or knowledge, or one farthing of indemnification, after the great losses by our traders in Krepee, and the almost ruinous expenses incurred by us during the war. The result is that we are all more and more convinced that the system which renders a reference to the Governor-in-chief at Sierra Leone requisite in all cases before any measure can be carried into effect, is one that tends very materially to retard the progress and injure the real interests of the settlements.

A glance at the past will show us what we may expect in the future, and also how to deal with it.\n\nMahba, King of Badiboo, formidable alike to all the native kings and to the French and to the English Government, sent last September a menacing despatch (in Arabic) to Colonel D'Arcy, the officer administering the Government of the Gambia, very warlike in its tone, and by subsequent actions violated all existing treaties. He detained all the British traders within the kingdom of Badiboo, with their goods and chattels, not allowing one man to leave the place, and also prevented all ingress into Badiboo, thus putting a stop to the trade of an extensive country, whose yearly quota of ground-nuts and hides adds greatly to the revenue of the colony. What was the *casus belli*?\n\nThe ostensible cause of this warlike and menacing attitude was, that a woman with a few children* availed themselves of Mahba's temporary absence from his capital, and made their escape to the British town of Bathurst. He at once sent to Colonel D'Arcy that, unless the woman and children were delivered up, all friendly diplomatic relation must stop, and trade cease, and the ports of Badiboo must, consequently, be considered closed to English merchants.\n\nBut the real cause, to all those who have studied the character of these Marabouts, inhabitants of the River Gambia, is to be found in that ambitious, overbearing, and covetous disposition of the Mussulmans, who view with discontent the rich prize they would obtain, could they have an opportunity of making one midnight raid on the rich Babboo Christian merchants at Bathurst. The toleration of this overbearing disposition of the Marabout chieftains in the River Gambia will always lead to serious complications; they must be made to understand that the British Government, although desirous of peace, yet still will never tolerate any nonsense from them.\n\nWe have not as yet forgotten the outrageous attack of Mahfal, the Commander-in-Chief of south-eastern Badiboo, on towns in British grounds, which led to the battle of Zoobabocolong; and at present, if reports from traders are correct, the greater part of Mahba's force is threatening Albreda. But the unhappy manner in which that most justifiable war was received by the home authorities, must for ever fetter the hands of all subsequent administrators of the Government of British Gambia."", 'last_edit_date': '1867-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1867#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.628, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'River Gambia', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""DEFEAT AND DEATH OF THE MAHOMETAN CHIEF AND WARRIOR MABA, OR MAHABA.**\n\nWe have often had to report in the African Times the successes and excesses of Maba, who has been the scourge of the countries between the Senegal and the Gambia, and thus brought himself occasionally into collision with both the French and the English. In 1861 he was an unimportant chief in the kingdom of Baddiboo, against which the last great war expedition of the British authorities in the Gambia was directed. Maba was a bigoted Mahometan, and watching his opportunity, he in 1861 rebelled against the King of Baddiboo, whom he put to death, raising himself to be supreme ruler of Baddiboo. He then declared a propaganda of Mahometanism, which he endeavoured to force by fire and sword in all the adjacent countries. His last recorded exploit was a successful attack upon some 300 French troops (Europeans), who were all slain except nine, the officer in command putting an end to his own existence.\n\nThe last French mail from Senegal brought to Europe the intelligence that this restless and cruel fanatic chief has at last met with the fate he has constantly provoked. He was therein stated to have been taken prisoner in battle by the Joloffe King of Sein, and by him put to death, his head and hands being sent by the Joloffe King to the French Governor of Senegal.\n\nBy the mail of the 2nd inst. from Bathurst we have a confirmation of this important news. As we are not of those who believe that the forcible spread of Mahometanism in Africa (and it never spreads in any other way) is desirable, we unfeignedly rejoice that this great warrior-chief, for such he undoubtedly was, exists no more to trouble the Gambia countries. He has interfered very much with the development of the ground-nut cultivation, on which the trade in the Gambia chiefly depends, and many British traders up the river have suffered severely in the troubles he was constantly exciting, and the wars he was as constantly waging; and we hope now to hear of a new era of trading prosperity there which may compensate them for their losses, and promote the spread of civilisation in those important countries. In this case we feel certain the British authorities will again find it necessary to place a small force at M'Carthy's Island, the former British outpost in the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1867-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1867#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.631, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Policy of Non-Intervention in Western Africa: Its Mischievous Tendency on the Good Government of the Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In the first case this would have delayed the expedition for two or three weeks; the Marabouts would have had everything their own way; they would have become masters of the stockaded towns in British Neomy, or Barra, from whence they might have marched on to Albreda, burnt it down, and pillaged the property of British and French merchants. Mahba, finding his captain-general so successful, might have sent down a large army, and swept away the whole of the Jollof population before we could even make an armed protest against them. The Marabouts at Goonjour, who were watching what turn events would take, would have pounced on the British towns of Newcastle, Jassewrang, Hamilton Town, and the towns in their ""father\'s ground"" at Sabajee; and destruction, confusion and perplexity would have been the result.\n\nHad the Marabouts been allowed to glory in their victory, and all expeditionary movement been disapproved of, the British Government would have lost all prestige in the river; the Governor of the Gambia would have been a nonentity, except in the town of Bathurst, and the Marabouts would have attempted to dictate terms to him in British grounds. As it was, they told Masamba Kokie before the war that the Governor of the Gambia speaks only soft words to them; ""he will never defend you against us;"" and Mahfal studiously made it to be believed amongst the whole of his people that there was an agreement between Mahba and the British Governor that they should fight against the Jollof Soninkees, and that nothing would be done to them; and had not the expedition taken place, it would have been impossible to persuade them to believe otherwise, and Masamba Kokie, the British chief, and all his people, would have been destroyed or driven from British ground by these foreign Marabouts.\n\nThe war had a most beneficial effect in the whole river. Mahba, on hearing of the success of the British arms at Zoobabocolong, sent immediately to the Governor disowning all connexion with Mahfal; all the British traders were looked upon with respect and fear; the Marabouts in native Neomy were ready at that moment to ask pardon for what they have done, and begged to be received again in British territory; the Goonjour people laid down their arms, and nothing more was heard of their intended marauding expedition, and British prestige was held up and respected in the rivers.\n\nWe have always freely complained of the many grievous errors in Colonel D\'Arcy\'s administration—but in that expedition Colonel D\'Arcy staked everything. He was determined to uphold the prestige of the British Government in the river, to moderate the Marabout influence, and to save British subjects from their murderous attacks. He staked his life and government in the undertaking. A short, inexpensive, decisive, and successful expedition would have been the only means to save the influence of the Gambia Government, and how far this was realized in the Zoobabocolong war former reports have told.\n\n---', 'last_edit_date': '1867-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1867#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Leader', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'all went well; ""peace, quietness, and justice began to reign in the land,"" we are told; but soon discussions arose, the Arab traders saw that the growth of Christian influence was fatal to the slave trade, and they began to intrigue against the Christian ministers of the new King Kiwewa, who, they got him to believe, were plotting against him—the idea being that the Christians wished to be governed by a woman, as in England. The chief of the Christian party managed also to offend the King, and this became the signal for the outbreak of a fresh revolution. The Mohammedans attacked the Christians—who were obliged to flee for their lives, two of the chief among the latter being killed. The Mohammedans, supported by the Arabs, were now in the ascendant, new officers of state were appointed, and the missionaries—both French and English—were cast into prison, being after a few days released, and told to leave the country, with the injunction: ""Let no white man come to Buganda for two years. We do not want to see a white teacher back in Buganda till we have converted the whole people to the Mohammedan faith.""\n\nThere is a lesson to be learnt from this case, and what has lately happened to the German East African Company in Zanzibar. In both cases the Arab traders were the instigators, though in the latter case they seem to have had matters simplified for them by the action of the German East African and Imperial authorities. If it be true that the German ships have occasionally been guilty of promiscuously shelling the coast, ""simply to overawe the natives,"" we can hardly wonder at the influence obtained by these Arab traders. In the ordinary way there is not much reason for this alliance between the natives and the Arabs—as the intercourse of the latter is generally confined to kidnapping and enslaving the former. But the presence of a common enemy is sure to drive them into alliance together. And let us remember the native mind does not grasp the difference between one European power and another. It is not in the interests of the Arab to enlighten them—on the contrary, it is clearly to his advantage to persuade them that all Europeans are bent upon their destruction. The Arab influence in East Africa is already immense. The chief obstacle to its further development lies in the hostility of the native tribes, who have trusted Europeans in preference, because they found that these have been just and considerate; but according to latest accounts, the Germans seem bent upon changing all this, and forcing the natives to make common cause with the Arabs.

That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

His worshippers seem to have forgotten what atrocities he had committed. The reason why they are opposed to the Soninkee Government was, that at certain times the people generally came to the factors and begged or demanded certain articles from them, and if refused in an obstinate manner, they considered it an insult to them, as the factors were occupying the ground of their fathers. The affray then generally terminated by the traders receiving a good flogging, and being made to pay a larger demand. I do not wonder at this being complained of; but if the traders were polite and obliging to them, and showed them that the goods did not really belong to the traders, at the same time making them small presents, they generally returned double the amount in a few days in cattle.\n\nWhen Badiboo was under the Soninkee Government, traders from every part of the country came down to trade in it, as it is situated near the large and populous kingdom of Salom. At Badiboo are the best cotton and phangs, numerous bandy cloth, and an immense quantity of ground-nuts; so much so, that Badiboo, under the government of the Soninkees, produced more nuts than any other kingdom on the River Gambia. The principal ground-nut marts were Swarak, Cindah, Bany, Kintak Cundah, and Sabaj. In these towns kola are sold in great abundance for phangs, and afterwards exchanged for ground-nuts, from which the petty traders derive great benefit.\n\nThe people at Badiboo are an intermixture of Jollof, Mandigo, and Foolahs, and from them the people at Bathurst receive yearly several head of cattle, with some fresh butter, corn, and rice. Although the Soninkees are universally considered to be lazy, yet still the lower class are hard-working, and when a Soninkee chief has rule over Marabouts, it is his general practice to compel them to work, so as to pay him a portion of their earnings. But when Mahaba became chief, trade almost ceased, the people in the interior being afraid to come down, as their property would not be secured from the ravages of Mahaba's people. The Cabuncas, who occupy an extensive region in the interior of Badiboo, reaching to Rio Nunez, on the other hand, were in the habit of coming down by land to Tenderbar, and from there cross over to Badiboo for the express purpose of purchasing horses and phangs, but they have since been afraid to do so."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-11-10', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1864#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BASUTOLAND.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We learn by telegram from Durban (Dec. 5) that all the Basuto chiefs, except Masupha, Joel, and Ramanella, having accepted the proposals of the Imperial Government, the issue practically rests with these malcontents.

In 1885 differences existed in the kingdom of Baddiboo, a country which, under favourable circumstances, contributes greatly to the prosperity of Gambia, because it grows the staple product of the settlement—ground nuts. The Baddiboo war, in conjunction with the simultaneous depression in the value of this staple, produced a disastrous decline in the revenue of Gambia, and therefore special efforts were made to bring about a settlement of the difficulty. After prolonged negotiations the Acting Administrator arranged a basis of peace, and the two rival chiefs, Beram Ceasey and Saide Mattie, signed treaties with the Government of Gambia in 1887, guaranteeing to stop the war, and to engage in no further hostilities without reference to the Governor at Bathurst.\n\nFor a short time matters went on satisfactorily, and preparations to cultivate Baddiboo were being renewed, when, unhappily, Saide Mattie, in opposition to the emphatic advice of the Administrator, persisted in going to the adjoining kingdom of Saloum to obtain redress for some wrong, imaginary or real, committed by the King of that country against him. Soon after the treaty was signed he proceeded with a strong contingent of his army to Saloum. The latter chief sought assistance from the French, who espoused his cause and warned Saide Mattie to return to Baddiboo. He was, however, defiant, and a fight ensued in which he and his army were utterly routed and driven back. They were pursued and dispersed, and Saide Mattie, seeing that all was over, took refuge in Albareda, and laid down his arms at the English Governor's request. He consented to go to the English settlement at Bathurst, and there he has remained ever since.\n\nThe difference made by a tribal war of this kind in the trade of the settlements on the adjacent coasts is shown by the circumstance that the trade of Gambia in ground nuts, which, in 1883, prior to the Baddiboo war, amounted to over 23,000 tons, had fallen in 1887 to less than 3,000.

This capture is looked upon as an earnest of the settlement of the disturbances which were the result of this chief's raids into the peaceful towns and villages in the Sulymah district. The British expedition which effected the capture of the chief was under the direction of Governor J. S. Hay, assisted by Captain Garrett. His Excellency had been in the bush in the interior since last December, and had succeeded in subduing all the warlike chiefs with the exception of Makiah. The latter has been driven from his stronghold at Largo, where Governor Hay found no fewer than 1,000 British subjects who had been captured by the rebellious chief; the chief made his escape, and the British force subsequently destroyed Wendeh, liberating from that place over 3,000 captives. The unhealthy nature of the bush was telling greatly upon Governor Hay; but, having got on the trail of Makiah, his Excellency was unwilling to give up the pursuit. Being run to earth and deprived of his followers, Makiah at last reached Gorpendeh, a hotly pressed fugitive. The chief of Gorpendeh was requested by Governor Hay to give up Makiah, but he hesitated, and appeared as if he intended to show fight; and, having a numerous following, would likely have caused much bloodshed. His Excellency, however, made a hurried march, and decided the matter by taking Makiah prisoner. This bold front, shown at a critical moment, had the desired effect upon the chief of Gorpendeh, who subsequently showed every friendliness to the British. Governor Hay then brought Makiah down to Sierra Leone, and lodged him the prison at Freetown. This crowning effort of the Governor's expedition was received with rejoicing at the British settlement, as Makiah has for a long time past interfered with the trade of the district.\n\nThe months which his Excellency had spent in the bush told severely on his health, and on his arrival at Sierra Leone he was quite prostrated.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

A few of those thus favoured rose to prominent public or political positions, like Dr Benjamin W.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': 'Nor is the \'traditional-modern\' polar model, with all its attendant implications of conflict and incompatibility, applicable to the entire spectrum of African experience of change under colonialism. There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure.

In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

The tragedy of the gifted poet from Madagascar, Jean-Joseph RabØarivelo (??-i937) who committed suicide through his - it was believed - failure to resolve this internal wrench in his colonial psyche, was a dramatic example. This gave a discernible ambiguous quality to the writings of many articulate Africans in the early period of colonial affirmation.

This comparison is clear, and can be easily grasped by the simplest minds.\n\nNow, before I conclude, let me give honour to your schoolmaster. It is but tiresome for him year after year to plod on the same course, to go over the old ground of instruction day after day. The small salary is not a sufficient reward for this labour; but with a well-regulated mind this labour becomes one of love, and his conscience tells him that his vocation is peculiarly honoured. Superficially, to those who do not reflect, the aged, poverty-stricken village master, teaching the mechanical art of reading or writing, is supposed only to teach that alone; while in truth he is protecting life, insuring property, fencing the altar, guarding the throne, giving peace and liberty to all the fine powers of man, and lifting him up to his own place in the order of creation. This is essentially true; for without education we should be like the wild nations around us, every man\'s hand against his neighbour.\n\nYou have, as I often told you, much to be thankful for—born in a Christian country, governed by a constitutional Christian Queen, to whom the words of our poet may be so truthfully applied—\n\n> Thou art alone  \n> (Of thy rare qualities, sweet gentleness,  \n> Thy meekness, saint-like, wife-like government,  \n> Obeying in commanding, and thy parts)  \n> The Queen of earthly queens.\n\nYour education, moreover, is superintended by ministers of the Gospel, who one after the other are compelled through sickness to leave their posts, and yet the good people of England send others to fill their places equally kind, equally zealous.\n\nI trust you will all grow up with life-long feelings of gratitude for all the advantages you are enjoying.

The lecturer said: The future of South Africa was much bound up with this question of administration, and especially the educational part of it. A proper education meant an assimilation of the coloured man to the ideal of the white man, with regard to habits of mind and of thought. The question of education was visibly affected by political disturbances. With regard to the general question, which was viewed in many different ways by white people both in the colony and at home, he said the great desideratum of the hour in South Africa was to raise the discussion of important matters beyond the atmosphere of party. Nothing had so much injured the native as the custom of using him for the purpose of a party cry. Premising that he should confine himself principally to the state of affairs in the Cape Colony, the Lecturer said he should show that there had existed and did still exist in that colony a State scheme for the instruction of the natives in nearly everything they might require to know, whether it was to shoe a horse, make a wheel, or learn Greek. As he had himself endeavoured to instruct the Caffre in the Greek declensions, in his capacity as Government Lecturer in the colony, he might say that the loftiness and catholicity of the scheme had come home to him. Remarking upon the difficulties in the way of applying such a scheme in a sparsely-peopled savage country like South Africa, he said the number of white colonists at the Cape was about equal to the population of Leeds, and these had to legislate for the reclamation of more than a million blacks, who were scattered over an immense tract. Other difficulties lay in the unequal social developments among the black people, in the bi-lingual character of the white population, and in the want of unanimity on the part of the white colonists as to the proper lines upon which native education ought to go. To bring under one system of State education men of different religious views, hard though it might be, was an easy task for the political legislator compared with that encountered in an attempt to group under one plan men so intellectually and, if he might use the term, spiritually distinct as the European and the African aboriginal races. The difference between the races was, practically speaking, one absolutely of kind, not of degree. Undeterred by difficulties, legislators at the Cape had boldly grappled with the question, and they had established a complete educational ladder, with the kraal schools at the bottom and the university at the top. After going with some detail into the working of the scheme in that colony, and suggesting some possible improvements in the system, he remarked that though philanthropy in theory, in practice it was unphilosophic. A cardinal fact was ignored—the generic difference between the European and the Caffre. The principle of heredity was ignored. He was inclined to believe that the Caffre would be influenced by a simple and rather an autocratic system. Advocating a certain measure of compulsion in order to make the Caffre industrious, and to compel him to be taught, he said the educationist should walk hand in hand with the white magistrate and the missionary; these three classes of men really replace the autocracy of the chiefs. He thought that if the philanthropist could be persuaded to believe that all men were not equal, and if the Boer could be persuaded to believe that they might be equal in course of time—in fact, that there was a germ which might be worked upon in the native, there would be some chance of an agreement. If both philanthropist and Boer should take the scientific view that the Caffre was really nothing more than he was by descent, a savage pure and simple, but that he had in him the makings of a good citizen, there would be considerably less friction in South Africa.'}]","[{'document_title': 'West Coast Government', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'portance, the presence of a continually increasing number of African girls educated in some of the best schools in England.

In your paper alluded to, it was said to be desired here that the Primitive Methodist Committee at home should send a European school teacher; but we do not all think thus, and I must say in plain words that the school we have at Fernando Po does not require a European school teacher, because we believe that an African school teacher is preferable to a European school teacher. An African teacher can better understand the ways, manners, and conduct of his country\'s children than a European teacher, especially in our island. Again, great men have said that if Africa should be evangelised, it would be by her own sons. Why should African young men, well qualified to teach their country\'s children in different branches of education, be put aside and a European teacher be sent for? We are confident enough that there are young men better qualified to fill the post of school teachers than such European teachers as would be sent for. Let the Primitive Committee at home observe that all down the Western Coast of Africa all schools are under the government of African young men. Let them look to Sierra Leone. There they will see a grammar-school, under the superintendence of an African clergyman as principal, whose boys are displaying his good tuition in institutions, colleges, and universities in England.

Short of Christianity, no subject is more intimately connected with the welfare of a subject or a protected people than that of their education, and yet there is not one that the Government has so much neglected in its West African settlements. The work of educating the people has been relegated entirely to Christian Missionary Societies. It cannot be that the Government is of opinion that African races are not capable of mental improvement and development, or that they do not need it, and that its government over those entrusted to it should simply be that of a police force for the preservation of order. If this is not its opinion, it is difficult to understand its policy. Whatever may be the ultimate intention for which it holds its settlements on the Coast—whether it be to make them eventually independent and self-governing, or to make them always appendages to the British territory—there is an obligation on its part to furnish them with the means of a liberal education, especially when they are not themselves in a position so to do, so that they may properly discharge their own obligations and answer the end of their existence. They have responsibilities which they cannot discharge without education. These settlements were acquired, and the position held by the Government secured, with the constantly avowed object of thereby aiding to suppress the slave-trade and correct the many untold evils it has inflicted upon Africa, and of making them renovating centres for Western Africa. The object is noble and laudable; but, I ask, what has the Government done to compass this end? What amount of education has it given to the people? For ignorance is as much a hindrance and weakens as education of the right sort is power, and progress. The development of the capabilities of the mind is a power of no little magnitude for developing the resources of a country that is poor and low in the midst of an abundance of the elements of wealth and greatness. The people should be educated to a strong sense of their privileges, duties, and responsibilities. Why is it, then, that the Government has all along neglected this duty, when it stands in loco parenta to these settlements? or has it no faith in the power of education? But for the Missionary Societies, and particularly the Church Missionary Society, which have established themselves in them, these settlements would not have been worth their present value. The efforts made by Government to educate have been very feeble; it has not convinced the people of its earnestness on the subject. I am one of those who think that the funds of Missionary Societies are sacred, and should be employed solely for the work of preaching the Gospel to the heathen. It is for this object they appeal to their friends for support constantly; it is not theirs to establish abroad schools of learning. If educational work is done by them, it should not generally exceed the barely elementary one which would enable converts to read the Scriptures for themselves, and that of raising up native missionaries and pastors to enforce on the people the truths they read. It is all the more necessary that this should be the case, because the area of ground to be covered in heathendom is large, and the funds of great missionary societies have not for many years now shown a large and steady increase. The claims upon them are many and urgent, and in some places there are doors of usefulness open to them already which they are urgently invited to occupy. Now, can they do this with an almost limited income if they must spend a considerable portion of it upon educational work?', 'last_edit_date': '1875-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1875#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.623, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I consider that, as far as may be expected of Missionary Societies, they have been liberal in their efforts to educate the people in some parts of the Coast, and particularly in Sierra Leone, where, besides the Missionary Colleges of the Church Missionary Society and the Wesleyan Missionary Society, the former has had a public Grammar School since 1845, and a Female Institution which is nearly as old, if not older, and training masters from England. The Government is indebted to them for the measure of educated native intelligence which it brings into requisition in its service. These Societies have shown that Africans are capable of any degree of improvement, and created a thirst for learning which the people are now anxious to have satisfied.\n\nI am not aware that their general educational work was subsidized by Government all the while they were at it; and it was hardly to be expected that the people themselves, mostly poor liberated slaves, could have contributed much for its support. The Government holds a position on the Gold Coast; this position is enhanced, and its responsibility increased, by the Act which has recently liberated hundreds of thousands of slaves from bondage, or at least placed them on the way to claim their freedom. Untold blessings to the Coast and the interior of Africa will, I expect, result from it if the efforts to discharge duties and responsibilities are of the right kind, and are properly directed. It is the duty, and will be to the honour of the Government to seek to liberate from slavery the minds of those whose bodies only have been made free.

From this it will be seen that such needful help as you have advocated is a *sine qua non* in the proper development of education in this place; and should it be afforded, an efficient staff of competent teachers will be secured, and high-class schools, grammar schools, collegiate schools, and other seminaries of learning will be established along this Coast, which will undoubtedly be productive of unspeakable benefit to the country at large. This, Mr. Editor, in my humble opinion, will be the only panacea for the effectual eradication of the moral, social, and intellectual evil under which ""the land is groaning.""\n\nThe hope of this country\'s elevation seems to me to be in the rising and future generations, in the proper development of their intellectual faculties, and the instilment into their minds of the ""sweets"" of education.

The clamours that are abroad in some parts of the world for a barely secular education are not likely to be raised by Africans if they are not educated to them; and the disputes which have been raised in some of the West African settlements about disestablishment, &c., are foreign to the genius of the African mind. African education, such as it is, is always allied with religion. Africans are, as a people, intensely religious; they are bold to assert the claims of religion everywhere, and parents are always careful to instruct their children in their religious faith. We want no Government restriction in the matter of religious education, whilst we would not compel any child to be instructed in Christianity. Nothing should be done to injure or destroy the intense native religious feeling of the African. The greatness of England, and, indeed, of Europe, is the greatness of religion—the greatness which has sprung from the Christian religion. This is the conviction of every thoughtful person who has seen it and inquired into it, though infidels and others say the contrary. Africa’s forms of religion have much to answer for her misery; her redemption is to be achieved both by the Christian religion and by education founded on it. The matter of African idiosyncrasies has yet to be studied and have its proper place accorded to it in the matter of education and religion.', 'last_edit_date': '1875-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1875#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.628, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Industrial Education in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Every month's experience justifies more and more the views of the African-Aid Society upon this question—views which they have only not carried into practical operation because, hitherto, there have been no funds for the work. To raise the industrial status of the African people, they must be taught those things which the civilised world has bit by bit acquired. Leave them to themselves, and they will never learn them. Why should they? They have not the same physical necessities that more northern people have. And physical necessity has been one of the great spurs to northern advancement. From a barbarism almost as degraded as that of the African, we have, under its impulse, gradually progressed to our present industrial, scientific, and social elevation. But there is no reason why the Africans should be condemned to a similar tortoise-like advance. The knowledge we have laboriously and tediously gained, in part from earlier civilizations, we could easily and rapidly impart, but it seems to have been almost the last thing thought of. In our anxiety to Christianise we have too much lost sight of the material aid that a spread of the arts, conveniences, and industrial facilities of civilization can bring to the inculcation of moral and religious truth. The African-Aid Society was formed that it might apply and urge the application of what was evidently so much needed. When it expressed its desire to conduct an emigration of coloured people from Canada and the United States to Africa, it was that it might introduce in their persons engineers, machinists, carpenters, blacksmiths, masons, cabinetmakers, brick and tile makers, trained agriculturists, millwrights, wheelwrights, coopers, waggon builders, road makers, &c., &c., &c. The progress of conviction as to the necessity of this has been slow in England. And this is not surprising, because it had not possessed the missionary mind in Africa. Any imaginable sum might be asked for religious missionary purposes in Africa, and it would be obtained. But ask for a small sum to teach the Africans the comforts and decencies, conveniences and industrial appliances of civilised life, and no national sentiment responded to the appeal. This is manifestly wrong. What we have freely received we ought freely to give. We, as a people, two thousand years ago had aid to help us out of our barbarism. The Britons were not left to imagine the utility of roads, and the advantage of clearings through forests: the Romans made roads and clearings for them. They were not left to imagine the advantage and comfort of solidly-constructed and comparatively commodious edifices: the Romans built towns and villages among them. And their work was not intended for mere temporary use alone. Substantial traces of it remain to this day. They are continually challenging our gratitude and admiration. And shall we not imitate in some degree the beneficial example? Shall we not strive to confer solid material benefits upon that Africa we so long assisted to rob of its most valuable possession—its human life; that we so long assisted to plunge deeper and deeper into the thick mire of barbarism, instead of helping her out of it? Our responsibilities toward Africa are far heavier than the public conscience has yet acknowledged. We know all the difference that exists between Great Britain now in Africa, and Rome formerly in Britain. Rome was laying the foundation for a permanent domination. We are not. Nationally, therefore, there is no analogy. But Rome had no such hideous debt of blood to Britain as we have to Africa. And we are Christian, not Pagan. We profess to be governed by higher principles than the Romans knew. We must, therefore, both as Government and people, do more than we have hitherto done for Africa. We must send her other teachers, as well as religious ones. We must establish centres of mechanical and other industry. The missionary mind in Africa is opening to this great truth.

We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Industrial Education in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '* An improvement in the native dwellings, however, cannot be effected as long as grass and leaves are used to cover them; many houses in which improvements had been made, by opening windows and giving more light and air, have been again restored to the windowless condition of native dwellings, through fear of fire.

The system of building in large compounds is connected with the laws and superstitions of the country; a general change and improvement in house building will go hand in hand with changes in Government and religion. It would be very desirable, however, for Europeans to introduce better roofing materials. Now iron will not do unless it could be effectually lined by some non-conductor of heat and sound. A lining is again attended with this evil, that the space between becomes the resort of vermin. Some other material should be obtained; tiles would be better than iron, and good clay can be found everywhere; but there is no workman skilled in tile making to teach the natives, and no European has yet seriously attempted to introduce the art. A native, who returned from the Brazils, made a few and covered his own house in a rough way. He died without communicating his art to others. A great impediment exists in the fact, that it is apparently an easier and more genteel employment for lads to become clerks, or to do a little trade on their own account, than to engage in mechanical employments. The ease with which credit is obtained, which is again the result of large profits, produces a host of petty traders, who end in becoming hopelessly involved in debt, giving the white merchant reason to call the people dishonest.

Religion would be best promoted in the end by making industrial pursuits the first aim (not before religion, but before head knowledge) in point of importance.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'The spread of Christianity, Islam and western education was another important impact of colonialism. There is no doubt that taking advantage of the peace and order as well as the patronage and in some areas the positive encouragement provided by colonialism, Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics pushed their activities further and further inland. As K. Asare Opoku has shown (Chapter 20), Christianity and Islam gained far more ground during the colonial period than had been the case during the previous three or four centuries put together. It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony.

The Glasgow Missionary Society, for instance, established a seminary at Lovedale in Natal in July 1841 to which an industrial department was attached. This taught masonry, carpentry, waggon-making and smithing, and from 1861 on, printing and book-binding.$^{19}$ The Roman Catholics had also established a convent of the Sisters of the Holy Family with a boarding school, primary school and home of refuge in Natal and another one in the Orange Free State by 1877.

The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence. The interests of these settlers clashed with those of the Africans and they used their influence with the colonial administration to obstruct or stultify African development."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Emergence of the Western-educated elite', 'content': 'The greatest social impact of the missionary revolution, however, was the emergence of an educated elite in Africa.

Three typical examples were James Africanus Horton who was born in 1835 in Sierra Leone, trained in Britain as a doctor from 1853 to 1859 and entered the West African Medical Service as a Staff Assistant Surgeon; Samuel Ajayi Crowther who was one of the first products of Fourah Bay College and the first African to be ordained as a Bishop of the Anglican Church; and James Johnson, that fiery intellectual and evangel¬ ist.28 Others included Broughton Davies, who qualified as a doctor in 1859, and Samuel Lewis, the lawyer, the first African to receive a knighthood.29 Liberia also produced a few intellectuals, among whom was Edward Wilmot Blyden, who was born in the West Indies. Slightly larger were the numbers in Nigeria and the Gold Coast. In Nigeria, the elite included people like Essien Ukpabio, D. B. Vincent (later known as Mojóla Agbebi), H. E. Macaulay, G. W.

With respect to the spread of education, the triumph of the new economic forces, the expansion of urbanization and therefore the rise of the new elites, West Africa would appear to have witnessed the greatest advances, followed by Egypt and the Maghrib, South Africa, East Africa and Central Africa. If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind.

The British colonies where substantial transforma- tions were registered included Egypt, Gold Coast, Nigeria, Uganda and Sierra Leone, with Kenya and the Rhodesias (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) coming after.

In Francophone Africa, on the other hand, the West African colonies would come first, followed by the North African colonies and then French Equatorial Africa. Within French West Africa, Senegal and Dahomey (now Benin) led the way with the other colonies lagging rather far behind.\nThe fact was that the spread and impact of the forces of change were controlled by more factors than any colonial government or African group was in a position to master completely. First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape. These provided good stepping stones for the forces of western education, western Christianity and western commerce to penetrate the interior. The east coast of the continent, on the other hand, came under sustained European contact only from about the 1870s."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'But not all those classified as belonging to the new elite in colonial Africa owed their membership of that class to education, nor did all those who owed it to education attain a uniform standard. As Professor Lucy Mair and a number of other scholars have shown, some gained entry into that class because they had made money from either large-scale farming or business and could help to finance the political agitation of their better educated but poorer brethren.$^{6}$ Some cotton and coffee farmers of Uganda, cocoa farmers of western Nigeria and the Gold Coast, coffee farmers of Ivory Coast and groundnut farmers of Senegal and The Gambia were able to gain membership of the new elite class on grounds of their success in that profession. Similarly, in West Africa especially, where many indifferently educated Africans were able to interpose themselves as middlemen between the primary producers and the big European commercial companies, commercial success also provided a ready passport to the new elite status. There were, however, others who qualified for consideration as members of the elite because they controlled mass organizations like labour unions and could give the better-educated elite the kind of mass support which they needed to convince the colonial powers that they spoke for the people. On the contrary, in East and Central Africa relatively few Africans gained admission into the elite group as a result of the deliberate policies pursued by the colonial rulers and the activities of the Indians and Portuguese and Greek petty traders. In fact, in many of these areas, the old central elite virtually disappeared.\nIt is largely this wide variation in their qualifications and background that makes it so difficult to define precisely in those terms who were the new elite of colonial Africa. One can thus justifiably argue that the issue of the rise of a new elite among any African people in the colonial era was largely a question of what amount and kind of educational and economic opportunities were available to the people and how far they put those opportunities to effective use. All the studies so far carried out on this aspect of the matter suggest that regions or colonies which witnessed the most intensive efforts in the propagation of western education and which offered Africans more opportunities for meaningful participation in trade and commercial agriculture produced the largest number of people of elite status.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.723, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Furthermore, though colonialism did introduce some social services as has been pointed out already, it must be emphasized that not only were these services grossly inadequate and unevenly distributed in each colony, but they were all by and large meant primarily for the benefit of the few white settlers and administrators, hence their concentration in the towns. Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi. It was not until after the Second World War that technical schools and univer› sity colleges were established in most parts of Africa. And significantly, only one university college each was established in the Gold Coast in 1947, in Nigeria in 1948, in Uganda in 1950, in Senegal and Madagascar in 1950, in Salisbury in 1953, in Congo Leopoldville in 1954 and Elizabethville in 1956.

Some were even of the servile class or were as yet unassimilated immigrants. This was because in such places it was members of these classes who first embraced western education, tried their hands at the new professions and moved to the urban centres while the traditional elite tended to stand back. But as soon as the benefits of western education and the new professions were demonstrated, members of the traditional elite also joined in. Some colonial powers, especially France and Britain, deliberately set out with varying results to encourage this belatedly awakened traditional elite group, for instance by establishing special schools for them. With the wealth they derived from their estates and/or their salaries as local authorities they were usually able to train their sons not only locally but also in higher institutions in Europe and America.\nIn some other parts of Africa, however, the traditional elite responded early to the call of western education and modern commercial ventures. In Egypt it was this class which took the lead in establishing western-type institutions. In Buganda this same class quickly recognized the advantages of western education and commercial farming. In Ethiopia they reacted in a similar manner to western education, sending their children to Europe and America to be educated. In this way they were able to retain the leadership of their countries.\nThus the fact that the ranks of the new elite contained people from different strata of society makes it risky to talk in easy terms of conflict between the new elite and the traditional rulers. In Sierra Leone and Liberia where for much of the period the new elites were made up of people who were not indigenous to these territories, there was an under› standable tendency for the elite communities of the coast to be in conflict and competition with the traditional societies of the interior. They were inclined to be contemptuous of the traditional leaders who in turn harboured an abiding suspicion of them.

Nor are they adequately explained in currently available scholarship. What appears to have occurred, particu› larly among Africans in British colonies, was an altered perspective of the American-educated African colliding with an inhospitable colonial reception (which was prompted by educational experiences completely outside the colonial orbit). 47 American education, however, was not universally or categorically opposed or disdained in the African colonies. Indications are that industrial or vocational training was welcomed by the colonial entrepreneur since it enabled him to secure well-trained artisans to drive motor lorries, build his houses, and manage his mechanical or electrical plant. Government officials and white missionaries encouraged this kind of training for different reasons: government officials because they believed that the commercial and economic development of the territory would be advanced, missionaries because they believed that Booker T.

This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization. As A. E. Afigbo has emphasized (Chapter 19), urban› ization was of course not unknown in pre-colonial Africa. The kingdoms and empires of Africa had such capitals or political centres as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, Gao and Great Zimbabwe; such commercial centres as Kano, Jenne, Sofala and Malindi, and such educational centres as Timbuktu, Cairo and Fez.

But other factors stifled local initiatives. First of all, general official policy, as would be expected in a colonial situation, was geared primarily towards the advancement of imperialist interests. Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction. By the first decade of the twentieth century, following the construction of railways, European firms were squeezing African traders in two related ways. Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

For some, the American black component within African nationalist ideology and strategies emerging during the colonial period was striking and unequivocal. In the view of others, for example some African students, interactions within American black arenas were disappointing and unrewarding. The caustic assessment of one such visitor illustrates the latter point: 'One of the things I had decided to find out during my stay in America was the condition of the descendants of former slaves brought here from Africa ... I feel safe in saying that, so far as economic and material progress are concerned the Negro in America is on the average ahead of the West African, but when it comes to integrity and genuine manhood, the American Negro is far below him.' 75 Another view was that many Afro-American missionaries who viewed Africans as 'poor heathen savages' must bear some of the responsibility for perpetuating a distorted and pernicious picture of Africa and Africans in the minds of their fellow American blacks. In other words, in their sedulous campaign to recruit American black workers for foreign missions, missionary churches undoubtedly succumbed occasionally to the tempta- tion of portraying an exotic, erotic and socially inferior Africa much in need of great sacrifice, hard work, and alien redemption."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 428, 'article_title': 'Cape Coast Castle Native Female School, Gold Coast, West Africa', 'full_section_title': 'Cape Coast Castle Native Female School, Gold Coast, West Africa', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1864#article-14', 'issue_date': '23_08_1864', 'content': 'Donations and subscriptions, however small, are earnestly solicited from the Christian and benevolent public, on behalf of a school for the spiritual and industrial instruction of the native converts and population at Cape Coast Castle, an institution the most highly calculated to raise and ameliorate the religious and social condition of the poor benighted Africans, by teaching them\n\n* The first transport corps for the supply of the troops on the Ashantee frontier, ninety miles from Cape Coast, with provisions and military stores, was a female one!\n\nto help themselves, and imparting that legitimate ambition for home and domestic improvement and industry, which would secure both their moral and social elevation, and render them not only a prosperous and industrious, but happy Christian people.\n\n250l. or 300l. is at present required to commence the work and open the school, which, when once established, would in a great measure be supported by the native king, chiefs, merchants, and other residents at Cape Coast Castle.

Jones, of Liverpool, to obtain a national grant for them in recognition of their father's valuable services to the country. In the meantime the old ladies are in absolute want, and although one or two private individuals have subscribed to relieve their present pressing needs, yet this is but a temporary relief, and it is hoped that the public may be induced to give a little comfort to cheer the declining days of the poor old ladies, which cannot now be many.\n\nIt may be that some of the readers of the *African Times* will remember the late Consul and his work for West Africa, and be pleased to help his daughters in their distress.

The scheme is one for the establishment of an institute for the training of negro girls to be run on lines similar to those followed in the working of the Congo Institute at Colwyn Bay, where young men are educated, trained up in Gospel truths on unsectarian lines, and taught a trade, whereby they can earn their own living by craftsmanship, and impart in their native tongue the knowledge they possess to their benighted fellow countrymen instructing them not only in ethics, but useful trades. Mr. Hughes, the principal, wishes to extend the benefactions to girls, and for this purpose makes an appeal for funds, which it is hoped will be responded to in a manner worthy the cause, not only for the sake of the spiritual leaven, but in the interests of commerce, which such an effort induces and stimulates.\n\nThe scheme of education as carried out at the Colwyn Bay Institute has been found to work most satisfactorily. Among its chief advantages may be pointed out: (1) The boys are taken away from old and injurious surroundings, from old practices, superstitions, temptations, and evil influences; (2) They for four or five years are residents in a Christian country and under new and beneficial influence, and see the benefits of civilisation; (3) They acquire without difficulty the English language, and, indeed, are able to read and study English books and translate them into their native language; (4) The youths are educated to become thorough masters of some handicraft.\n\nIt should perhaps be mentioned that carpentering, printing, tailoring, &c., are taught them free, for the Welsh people have never charged a single apprenticeship fee; and Messrs. Elder, Dempster & Co., the great African shippers, convey the students to and from Africa free.\n\nMost successfully has the scheme worked; the boys who have returned to Africa have all done well. They carry back with them tools and other appliances, which enable them to earn an honest living, and, at the same time, to impart instruction to others.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-04-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_04_1897#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ENGLAND AND HER WEST AFRICAN COLONIES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Macaulay prefaced his remarks on ""England and her West African Colonies"" by stating that he hoped to be able to prove, in the course of his essay, the success attendant upon the ecclesiastical, political, and commercial efforts of British enterprise in the West African Colonies of England, and to picture their early history with the stubborn realities existing at the present time. Although not the first among European nations to plant colonies beyond Europe, England had acquired a more extensive dominion of colonies and dependencies than any other nation in the world. She undertook the colonisation of West Africa, not by any means for renown or direct commercial advantage, but entirely with the magnanimous and philanthropic object of the salvation of the sons of Africa, both temporally and spiritually. The Colonies on the West Coast of Africa were annexed to Great Britain, first, for the suppression of that abominable traffic, the slave trade, and, secondly, for the free propagation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The colonial dependencies of Great Britain on the West Coast of Africa, which formed a portion of the 7,500,000 square miles of the British Empire, included Sierra Leone or the West Africa Settlements, the River Gambia, the Gold Coast Colony and the Slave Coast—now Lagos Colony—a total area of some 40,000 square miles. The lecturer briefly described the geographical position and features of each settlement, and then gave an interesting account of the circumstances under which Sierra Leone, the oldest colony in West Africa, became a British settlement, an episode with which those who have studied history are generally familiar. This colony eventually became peopled, and a foundation was laid for the labours of the Church Missionary Society and other Christian bodies in the year 1791. In the year 1799 a few Englishmen established in London ""The Society for Mission to Africa and the East,"" up to which time the Church of England had done nothing to spread Christianity among the heathen. In 1812 this name was changed to ""The Church Missionary Society for Africa and the East."" The first missionaries were sent to West Africa, because it had ever been, and it was then, the chief theatre of the inhuman slave trade. The great difficulty was to get missionaries, owing to the fatality of the climate to Europeans, the trying difficulties and experiences of the work, and the prevalent but erroneous idea that all efforts to raise the blacks in the social scale must prove fruitless. Ultimately two German missionaries were prevailed upon to enter upon the great and good work, and others subsequently followed from England, and ever since had been from time to time reinforced. In the first month of 1814 the foundation stone of the first Christian Church in Africa was laid at Bassia, and the committee of the above-mentioned society, now co-operating with the British & Foreign Society, were deeply engaged in carrying out the plan of redeeming as many African children as possible from slavery and attaching them to the missionary settlements. Having gone through the early history of the Church on the West Coast of Africa, the lecturer proceeded to detail a few facts to prove the glorious results of the labours of the religious societies in co-operation with the foundation laid by the goodwill and philanthropic energies of many noble-hearted men, whose efforts and constant ambition were devoted to the abolition of slavery and the slave trade. Amongst many results were the most perfect freedom of the meanest subject; the existence, all over the coast line, of peace and tranquillity as set against the unending civil wars and riots that marked the period of slavery; the ecclesiastical establishment of the West African settlements, and the profuse circulation of the Bible throughout the Colonies.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Too much praise cannot be given you for your unwearied and long-continued efforts on behalf of poor Africa and her unfortunate sons. The lively interest and heartfelt sympathy you have always manifested in the work of Africa\'s regeneration and advancement seems ever to be increasing with the onward march of time, and it is to be hoped that such zealous and benevolent efforts will be crowned with abundant success.\n\nYour remarks on the subject of Education in your last two issues, and the convincing arguments you advanced to recommend the subject to the notice of the ""higher powers,"" have been read by not a few here with feelings of deep gratitude and satisfaction. It is greatly to be hoped that such an earnest appeal will not be suffered to pass by unheard. It is gratifying to state that the Accra Church of England High-class School has been fairly established and set in proper working order, and since its establishment the number of its pupils has been steadily on the increase. If, as stated in my previous correspondence, such a school as the High-class School be amply and efficiently supported, it will prove a great boon to the place. That the educational work that is thus being inaugurated here needs such support as you have pleaded for will be evident from the fact that it has not been undertaken by the Church Missionary Society, as your remarks would seem to indicate, but by the sole efforts of some of the native residents of this place, who, sensible of the great educational wants of the community, have requested the Bishop of Sierra Leone to aid them in the establishment here of the Church of England with a properly-organized school; and the kind-hearted prelate, ever ready to lend a helping hand to every very good work, promised to aid their efforts in the undertaking. From this it will be seen that such needful help as you have advocated is a *sine qua non* in the proper development of education in this place; and should it be afforded, an efficient staff of competent teachers will be secured, and high-class schools, grammar schools, collegiate schools, and other seminaries of learning will be established along this Coast, which will undoubtedly be productive of unspeakable benefit to the country at large. This, Mr. Editor, in my humble opinion, will be the only panacea for the effectual eradication of the moral, social, and intellectual evil under which ""the land is groaning.""\n\nThe hope of this country\'s elevation seems to me to be in the rising and future generations, in the proper development of their intellectual faculties, and the instilment into their minds of the ""sweets"" of education.

We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE ACTION OF THE AFRICAN-AID SOCIETY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Africa, anything beyond the mere egotism of surface philanthropy, it will find fresh support.

England had extended to her West African dependencies the privileges of British legitimate trade and commerce, which was a powerful vehicle for the advancement of civilisation.\n\nBringing forward the commercial advancement of the West African Colonies, he said the question had often been asked, ""Do the Colonies pay?"" He could answer with an emphatic affirmative. In 1837 the total external trade of England with all the Colonies was £28,341,471; it was now nearly £300,000,000, thus showing an increase of about ten times. The British shipping in connexion with the Colonies in 1837 was 3,677,975 tons; in 1885 it was 56,611,075 tons. The English Customs returns reckoned the exports to the Colonies in 1837 at £11,283,363; and this had since risen to £54,545,553. Her Majesty\'s Colonies, he said, furnished more than a quarter of the whole world\'s annual supply of gold. He then referred to the commercial geography of the British African Colonies, gave the value of their exports and imports, and reviewed the trade generally. The construction of a railway to the interior of Africa from Lagos was a recent proposition and a new feature in the history of the West African Colonies. It was obvious that Africa was, or would be, the only continent open for the future expansion of British manufacture; in such a case the interior would play an important part. He maintained, with eminent authorities on the subject, that by native agency alone, under foreign supervision necessarily, could tropical Africa be gradually and definitely developed on any permanent basis, and that the negro should be educated industrially and otherwise with the generous help of Europe and America. Whatever was accomplished by native agency, England certainly should carry the credit of effecting such accomplishment in the civilisation of Africa. It was beyond doubt that the English were acknowledged the best colonisers; and the marked consideration invariably shown by them to the people whom they undertook to govern, the extreme liberty and entire privileges of a British subject extended to every native, and the judicious caution characteristic of the policy of the British Government had altogether won for England this success and the preference to all other civilised nations.

There is a demand for this; and since the Government has rendered very little help to educational work, it is right for us to expect that it would take up such a work earnestly. The people unaided are unable to provide themselves with such establishments. The practice has been adopted of sending young men and young women to England for education, but it is a very expensive one and is attended with a great risk, and comparatively very few persons can use it. The success that has attended it is one of a doubtful character. Some have returned home with enfeebled constitutions. English teachers have not generally been able to imbue the minds of their African scholars with patriotism, and a sense of their obligations and responsibility to their country. There has been too much of being wrapt up in self. Expensiveness and the fear of their succumbing to the effects of a foreign and trying climate have often necessitated a short stay, and placed them at a disadvantage. Colleges such as I have spoken of will be a boon to the whole Coast, and be hailed with gladness; and if, after successful residence in them, visits are made to England for a finishing, much good will, I think, be done thereby.\n\nIn this matter, as in that of elementary schools for the Gold Coast, the Government will find it most helpful to ask the aid and co-operation of the Church Missionary Society, that has already a very good foundation to work upon. I would not ask that any burden be laid upon British taxpayers; local funds should be economized for this work, and a combination of local Government efforts would remove much of the pecuniary difficulty that may be raised in the matter of superior colleges.—I am, dear Sir, yours truly,', 'last_edit_date': '1875-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1875#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICA FOR AFRICANS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.\n\nSIR,—Allow me to excite the interest of your readers in a scheme which I am at present promoting, on behalf of the African race, of which I am a member.\n\nThe project, briefly stated, is to acquire a tract of land in British Central Africa, and to utilise the descendants of the race now resident in the British West Indies for the purpose of developing its resources, and for the furtherance of civilisation among the Natives. A grant of 10,000 acres, situated near a civilised centre, is required as a basis. The land will be divided into ten sections of 1,000 acres each; and, upon each of these divisions, ten carefully selected and well-trained families will be located. A sum of £25,000 will be required to enable the settlers to hold out for the first three years, while adjusting themselves to their new habitat, and to pay for the land should it be found necessary to purchase it.\n\nDuring this period each head of a family would receive sufficient food and clothing for himself and his household, but would not be entitled to any further remuneration. At the beginning of the fourth year, however, an additional allowance of £30 per annum would, in like manner, be given, as it is hoped that by that time an income would be obtained from the land under cultivation. This arrangement would continue until the close of the tenth year, when the land would become the property of the people. The net proceeds of their earnings during this said period would be employed in the spread of civilisation among the Natives, and in the assisting of other enterprising Africans who were desirous of returning and settling down in their Fatherland.\n\nThe £25,000 necessary to float the scheme is not required at present. It will be raised with the help of a Committee\n\nwhen the proper time arrives. I purpose, first of all, to go, spy out, and secure the land; secondly, to proceed to the West Indies to select the first 100 families as pioneers.\n\nTo meet this preliminary expense and charges already incurred in connexion with the maturing and developing of the scheme, a sum of not less than £650 is required. About £300 of this moderate amount has already been subscribed by more than 200 highly representative friends, and further contributions are earnestly solicited from all who take an interest in the progress of the African race.\n\nSubscriptions can be sent to the Treasurers—Edward P. Thomson, Esq., W.S., 76 George Street, Edinburgh; and Alexander Breingan, Esq., Bank of Scotland, Helensburgh, N.B.—who will duly acknowledge the same. The name and address of each subscriber, together with the amount given, will then be entered in one of the official books, specially provided for the purpose. As soon as the necessary sum is obtained, a printed list of all the subscriptions will be published, along with a statement of the expenditure, and a copy sent to each subscriber.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1896#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Development of Tropical Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. H. H. Johnston said ever since the end of last century the attention of the British had been given to the opening up of tropical Africa. It was, however, directed by the instinct of commercial expansion and the desire of planting among the natives our ideas of religion and philanthropy. On many occasions the Government had disavowed any intention of political aggrandisement. It was only lately that we could thank those who held the reins of Government for the position we now occupied as an African Power. Whatever had been done previously had been accomplished by traders and missionaries. This country was the first to send out a surveying expedition to the Congo, and yet we were ready to give in once to the partition of its territory among various European countries. It was the same after a magnificent campaign in Ashantee and Abyssinia. Millions of money had been spent and brave men had lost their lives from 1799 to 1890 to practically no purpose. But it was querulous to make complaints about what had been done in view of what had recently occurred. The result of Lord Salisbury\'s action in respect of African affairs would be of stupendous import, and the possession of such territory was a matter of great moment, for it was a fact that nowhere did Englishmen and their civilising work thrive so well as they did under conditions of existence and regulations made by themselves. Let other countries have their fair share of the Dark Continent as a theatre for their expansion, and let England now set herself to the duty of developing the resources of those lands which she had secured. There were two ways in which Africa might be governed under the British flag. One was by chartered companies, and the other by direct Imperial rule; and it would almost seem better if Africa were always governed direct, in some form or other of Imperial Government, though this was not always practically possible. A Parliament always grumbled over the cost to the Exchequer of such a place as Bechuanaland was not likely to vote money in an extension of such sway. The majority of men sent to Parliament were badly instructed in geography, and were indifferent to the interests of Great Britain, and the object of some of them seemed to be to hinder the expansion and maintenance of the British Empire. It was well, therefore, that there should be conferred upon the great administrating companies rights and privileges in return for the work they did and the money they were called upon to expend. He was thankful that such companies were formed to make their experiments in empire-founding. Yet, if a considerable amount of money, say £250,000 a year, were expended imperially in opening up and governing Africa, what an immense return it would make, and what an effect it would have upon the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, London, and other places. Africa would take their hardware, cotton goods, agricultural implements, sewing machines, knives, needles, steel railways, tin provisions, coals, pianos, harmoniums, fireworks, and other products, which would have an ever-widening consumption. In return there would be a most profitable exchange. Great as our Indian Empire was, it was only able to employ half of the well-conducted British youth. Africa would find employment for the remainder if a similar Government service were inaugurated there, and he did not think that with the changes which would be effected by the inauguration of the British, Africa would be a bit more unhealthy than India. But Africa should not be a theatre for the failures of life here—of the bankrupt, the ne\'er-do-weels, and such like. Men should be trained for the work, as they were in China and elsewhere. To succeed in Africa, a man must have a liking for the place, he must be enthusiastic in his work, and ready to bear up against the monotony which prevailed everywhere in an uncivilised land. He must be abstemious and self-denying; there must be no gluttony, or high living. Reviewing the wealth of Africa, he enumerated its valuable wild beasts, which he would like to see preserved to give colour to our existence, as well as for their intrinsic worth. Adverting to the vegetable products of the tropical regions he pointed out that they were all of commercial value, and that with the establishing of a settled government, and the introduction of systematic cultivation, they might be extended almost indefinitely. As for rubber, indigo, gums, reeds, etc., there was at present a great export, while cotton might be grown profitably to an enormous extent. The palm oil trade led to the settlement of the ""oil rivers,"" which from a swamp had been transformed into a comparatively healthy residential and commercial district. Besides these kinds of produce, ranging from £10 to £25 per ton, there were dyewoods and forests of timber of most valuable kind. Gold was found running all the way up the continent from the south, at any rate as far as Darfur and the Soudan, and diagonally westwards into the Niger basins. Silver was found in the western portions of the continent in conjunction with antimony, and as the latter metal had been found in other parts, it was reasonable to suppose that silver would be found also. Copper was found in South Central Africa, and iron was found in abundance, while good coal had been discovered on the shores of Lake Nyassa and the Zambesi, as well as other places. He need scarcely allude to the diamond fields, but it was certain that other precious stones—topazes, opals, &c.—were found in certain districts. What he had named were only a small portion of the products of these regions, and many more were to be discovered and utilised.

Every year the missionary schools discharge a number of educated men and women who almost invariably embark in trade. Most of them have some small capital, which they use to trade with the interior natives, and the produce they thus obtain they either ship on consignment to England, to obtain the proceeds in British and other goods and silver coin, or sell it to the large British and foreign mercantile houses on the Coast, receiving goods from them in exchange for a renewal of operations with the producers in the interior. These native traders almost universally prefer to remit their produce to Europe for sale; but in this they labour under the great disadvantage of having their capital locked up until they obtain from Europe the proceeds of the sales, in goods or money. They estimate their loss through such delays at something like 25 per cent., and there can be no doubt that the facilities a bank might safely afford would be productive of great gain, both to the traders and the bank; while, if the limits of our article would permit, we could point out how the European mercantile establishments may also be largely benefited thereby. To every one acquainted with the business of the West Coast, and the mode in which it is conducted, it is patent that the establishment of a well-conducted bank, with adequate capital, will lead to a greatly increased production on the West Coast—in a few years, it may be, to 100 per cent. increase. A bank, moreover, that is capable of offering ample guarantees for the safety of moneys deposited with it, cannot fail of being highly useful to the public service as bankers to the several Administrations, receiving from the Colonial Treasurers the proceeds of the Customs' duties and other sources of revenue, and holding them at the disposal of the Government in the shape most convenient to the latter. Such a bank will link West Africa, now isolated, with the great financial system of the civilized world, giving her a recognized position therein—a fact of enormous importance for the British West African Settlements, when we consider that almost everything that can be accomplished by capital has yet to be effected there. All the aids and appliances of civilization for facilitating communications between the Coast and the interior, for economizing labour, for the transport of goods and produce, and for the development of the abounding natural and mineral resources, have yet to be introduced; and a well-established bank, giving large dividends to its shareholders, will show European capital the way to further profitable investment in those too long neglected countries. We have always steadfastly maintained that ere many years the West Africa Settlements will take rank among the most valuable colonial possessions of Great Britain, and every fresh step towards the realization of this prediction is to us a source of real delight. The bank is such a step, and we shall welcome it with all our heart. We can assure it, too, a welcome all along the West Coast, to which it cannot fail to prove a benefactor. Our only regret at this moment is, that it will not be brought before the public in time for us to advertise it more fully in this number of our journal.

It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain. If we gave away the Gold Coasts or Lagos, or the Niger, for instance, in exchange for concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or the North Atlantic, the ratio of loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be far greater than the gain to the Australians or the Newfoundlanders. To those who argue that our missionaries and merchants might go on working in West Africa just the same, even if the rule in our possession were transferred to another Power, I would ask, \'How many British merchants are there in French Senegambia? What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value. Then as to Zanzibar and British East Africa, they, in their turn, besides securing the southern approach to the dominions of our Egyptian ward, are a necessity to the trade and overflow emigration of our great Indian Empire, with its nearly 300,000,000 of people and its yearly trade with the British Empire of some £90,000,000. The trade of the British Empire with British Africa amounts to about £25,200,000 yearly. Among the more valuable products which British Africa sends us, or supplies to herself, may be cited the following: gold, silver, copper, coal, diamonds, ivory, rubber, palm oil, palm kernels, gums, cotton, dyewoods, indigo, coffee, sugar, rice, Indian corn, horses, cattle, donkeys, hides, amomum seeds, red peppers, and many other valuable dyes, spices, oils, timber, drugs, skins, and farinaceous foods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE NEWEST BRITISH COLONY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Further and very gratifying progress has been made during the past year by the Colonial movement.

Germany can now be numbered among the Colonial Powers, for her empire beyond the sea has reached great dimensions. The advance made during the closing year relates chiefly to East Africa, where the German East African Company has continued its career of activity. Several additions have been made to the vast region under Germany's protection in that part of the Dark Continent, and, what is more, steps have been taken to accelerate the development of the lands acquired, and to prepare the way for trade. One of the latest East African acquisitions of importance is the Vitu region, the protection of which has been arranged by the German Colonial Association; but since this land was secured the East African Company has added to its possessions, the fresh acquisition taking in Port Durnford and a considerable stretch of coastland. Steps are now being taken to form a plantation company which will carry on operations in East Africa, and will cultivate tobacco, cotton, cocoa, &c. As yet great difficulty has been experienced in regard to the labour question. The natives are well behaved, but they do not show any inclination to work unless for the satisfaction of immediate needs, and directly these needs are covered, they betake themselves to idleness.

The point was that nationalism was taking a reverse course to the expression of the same phenomenon in Europe. Contrary to what happened in Europe, the state was created before the cultural nations that would make it a meaningful political community were welded together. It is in this sense that one should take James Coleman's observation that: ... the drive behind African nationalism in many instances is not the consciousness of belonging to a distinct politico-cultural unit which is seeking to protect or assert itself, but rather it is the movement of racially-conscious modernists seeking to create new political and cultural nationalities out of the heterogenous people within the artificial boundaries imposed by the European master ... '\nWe must recognize that colonialism, as a system of relations, rests upon some kind of racialism, and that since development in a colonial situation is a product of interactions between the colonizer and the colonized, racial consciousness is basic to the growth of nationalism as a search for sovereignty and independence.\nThat African nationalists are regarded as 'modernists' is a reflection of the fact that they were operating within an externally defined setting which imposed alien systems of values, norms, and definitions of political and social developments to which they had to subscribe as a condition for success. That nationalism in Africa is a dynamic, ongoing phenomenon is clear from the extensive literature on themes like nation-building and irredentism.

They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure. The point is that colonial Africans were probably not unaware of the elementary fact that accepting \'new forms [would] increase the range of alternatives\'$^{3}$ available to them.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A common pattern of the movement of cultural forms and their concrete manifestations, the incident provides an apt model of survival, even renewal of cultural values in the face of religious and other more socially intensive forms of domination.

The slave trade had intensified internecine warfare for over two centuries, leading to cultural devastation on an unprecedented scale. Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent. Different methods of foreign control or interaction with the African populace naturally evoked or created different cultural responses from the displaced African. Belgian and Portuguese colonialism, as well as British settler colonialism in East Africa, are easily recognized as the most ruthless on the continent. They created conditions for the truly displaced African in the most literal sense of the word.

In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

However, colonialism proved just as ephemeral as any other institution created and maintained by force. Within a matter of only some forty-five years from 1935, the colonial system had been uprooted from over 90% of Africa and confined only to that part of the continent south of the Limpopo River. That is to say, colonial› ism lasted in most parts of Africa for under a hundred years, indeed from the 1880s to the 1960s. In the history of a people and a whole continent, this is a very brief span indeed. How and why this incredible feat of the uprooting of colonialism was accomplished, or, to quote the words of Margery Perham, why this 'astonishingly rapid emancipation since 1950' ' form two of the main themes of the concluding volume of this History. In the concluding chapter of this volume, however, we would like to address ourselves to two main questions. First, what legacies did colonialism bequeath to Africa, or what impact did it make on Africa? The second question is, in view of this impact or balance sheet, what is the significance of colonialism for Africa? Does it constitute a revolutionary or important episode in the history of the continent? Was it a major break with the past of the continent, or was it, after all, a mere passing event which did not constitute a break in the history of the continent? Or as L. H. Gann and Peter Duignan have posed the same question, what is 'the place of the colonial era within the wider context of African history'? 2"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The structure of Volume VII', 'content': ""The second section deals with a theme that had until the 1960s either been grossly misrepresented or entirely ignored by the colonial school of African historiography, namely, African initiatives and reactions in the face of the conquest and occupation of Africa. To the members of this school such as H. H. Johnston, Sir Alan Burns and, more recently, Margery Perham, Lewis H. Gann and Peter Duignan,$^{10}$ Africans in fact welcomed the establishment of colonial rule since not only did it save them from anarchy and internecine warfare but it also brought them some concrete benefits. Thus Margery Perham: most of the tribes quickly accepted European rule as part of an irresist› ible order, one which brought many benefits, above all peace, and exciting novelties, railways and roads, lamps, bicycles, ploughs, new foods and crops, and all that could be acquired and experienced in town and city. For the ruling classes, traditional or created, it brought a new strength and security of status and new forms of wealth and power. For many years after annexation, though there was much bewilderment, revolts were very few, and there does not appear to have been much sense of indignity at being ruled. ' ' Such ideas are also reflected in the use of such Eurocentric terms as 'pacification', Pax Britannica and Pax Gallica used to describe what amounted to the conquest and occupation of Africa between 1890 and 1914. Those historians who did pay some attention to this subject mentioned it almost accidentally or casually. In their A Short History of Africa which first appeared in 1962, one of the very first modern professional surveys of the history of Africa, the English historians, Roland Oliver and J. D. Fage, devoted only a single paragraph to what they termed 'bitter resistance' by Africans in a chapter of fourteen pages dealing with what has become known as the European Scramble for African colonies. It is to correct this wrong interpretation of the colonial school and to redress the balance and highlight the African perspective that we have devoted as many as seven chapters to this theme of African initiatives and reactions."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The significance of colonialism for Africa', 'content': ""This leads us on, then, to the second question posed at the beginning of the chapter, namely, the real significance of colonialism for Africa. Does it constitute a break with Africa's past or was it just a mere episode in its history, an episode which is of limited importance and which did not affect the course of African development? Here again, conflicting answers have been given to this question. To some historians, indeed a very large number, including the Marxist and the development and anti-development theorists but for very different reasons, though colonialism was a short interlude, it nevertheless was of great significance for Africa and left an indelible impression on Africa. As R. Oliver and N. Atmore contend: 'Measured on the time-scale of history, the colonial period was but an interlude of comparatively short duration. But it was an interlude that radically changed the direction and momentum of African history.'$^{50}$ Gann and Duignan also regard the colonial era 'as most decisive for the future of Africa'.$^{51}$ The answer of the Marxists and the underdevelopment theorists is neatly summed up in the title of Rodney's book, namely, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa. On the other hand, there are others who regard the colonial impact as skin-deep and that colonialism did not con› stitute any break with the African past. In a series of publications, 52 J. F. A. Ajayi has consistently maintained that the impact of colonialism on Africa has been exaggerated, that colonialism 'represents only an episode in a long and eventful history', and did not cause any break in continuity, that Africans retained some control over their own destinies and 'to the extent to which Africans retained initiative, the ability of Europeans to make entirely new departures in African history was limited'. Hopkins has also maintained that the 'colonial era has ceased to be regarded as the sole substance of African history and there are sound reasons for thinking that colonial rule itself had a less dramatic and a less pervasive economic impact than was once supposed'. He has insisted that colonial› ism did 'not create modernity out of backwardness by suddenly disrupting a traditional state of low-level equilibrium' and that 'the main function of the new rulers was to give impetus to a process of economic development which was already under way'. 53 To this author, there is really no simple yes or no answer to this question since the impact of colonialism"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The significance of colonialism for Africa', 'content': ""On the other hand, in the cultural and social field, the impact of colonial› ism was relatively neither profound nor permanent. Such changes as were introduced in the cultural field, such racial discrimination as was practised, and such condemnation of African culture as was preached even in the heyday of colonialism, were all confined primarily to the coastal areas and the urban centres, and never penetrated into the rural areas where life ran gaily on very much as before. African dance, art, music and traditional religious systems held their own and such borrowings and adaptations as were made by Africans were not only selective but also, to borrow M. J. Herskovits' terminology, 'additive' and not necessarily 'substitutive'. 56 Thus, in the rural areas and even to some extent in the urban ones, new beliefs, new gods, new utensils, new artefacts and new objects were added to the old ones. Certainly, in these areas, many Christians did and still do retain their belief in their traditional gods. Indeed, in the field of religion, if anything, it was the European religion that was rather Africanized as is obvious from the rituals, hymns, music and even doctrines of some of the syncretic and millenarian churches and not the other way round. What is even more important, the ground that was lost even in the urban centres in the field of culture has virtually been regained.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust.

One was by a Cabinet Minister in England, at Aberdeen, the other in an essay delivered at the last distribution of prizes in the grammar school here by one of the instructors. Now, far be it from me either to deny the prophecy, or become a prophet myself; but I think that, in both instances, though the ""tale has been adorned,"" the moral has not been pointed. There is but one way in which Africa can be advanced, and that is, by the honesty, by the industry, and by the well-directed energy of the Africans themselves. If we trace the history of any nation emerging from barbarism to civilization, we shall find that though the first move was effected through foreign conquest or occupation, the remainder has been achieved by the people themselves. The first move has been effected as regards the Western Coast of Africa. European stations have been formed; European laws and customs have been introduced; European civilization has been witnessed; but are the Africans, as a race, emulating this example? Go outside any of the European settlements, and I fear you will still find slavery, torture, superstition, idolatry, and idleness. Until the Africans themselves shake off these vices, though we may succeed in establishing civilization in isolated parts, as in this colony, Africa as a country can never rise.

The man who, in his usurped office of coroner, committed Bailey for murder, and who, in his office as police magistrate, again committed him for murder, could scarcely have failed to convict him for murder when sitting as Chief Magistrate to try this same Bailey, on this same charge of murder, and on the same evidence on which he had previously committed him. But, happily, there was a jury. We decline to make any further comment at present, merely placing this trial of George Bailey on record for future notice.""}, {'id': 2845, 'article_title': 'Lord Roseberry on Socialism', 'full_section_title': 'Lord Roseberry on Socialism', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_11_1874#article-24', 'issue_date': '30_11_1874', 'content': 'No one can forget that we live in remarkable times—times of social development so ominous that we may be approaching a period of social revolution.

It may with truth be said, that throughout a period of ten or twelve hundred years they were the great battle- fields of the world. Once decked with cities unsurpassed in mag- nificence by any others we know of, they became at length a waste of ruinous heaps. The blood, flesh, and bones of hundreds of millions of Romans, Persians, Saracens, Egyptians, Turks, Roman Catholic Crusaders, Osmanlis, and others, have been scattered over the whole surface of Judea and Syria, every foot of ground in which has from time to time been disputed by hostile armies. Depopulated, wasted, ruined, these countries remained finally in possession, or under the dominion, of the Osmanli Turks enthroned at Constantinople—the lowest depth of degradation into which any lands could possibly descend within the limits of what was known as the Old Roman World. Only one who has read Keith\'s ""Land of Israel"" can form any- thing like a correct idea of what has happened in those lands, and the state to which they have been reduced by wars and con- quests, and, finally, by Turkish misrule. Held in the feeble yet despotic and tormenting grasp of the Osmanli Turks, lands and people, the few of the latter which remained, had attained to the lowest degree of debasement, when the discoveries of modern science laid them open to the gaze of the civilized world, and commenced the preparing of the way for those changes prophe- sied by divinely-inspired servants of God two thousand five hundred years ago.\n\nWe have dealt thus very briefly with the changes which have occurred in the condition of both lands and people since the com- mencement of the Christian Era. The student of, and believer in, the divine prophecies handed down to us in what we call ""The Bible"" finds the whole of these changes therein luminously displayed. Both land and people are in the condition which divine prophecy indicated for them: the one dispersed, yet distinct; the other desolate, and only nominally possessed.\n\n*(To be continued.)*'}, {'id': 3847, 'article_title': 'The Belgian Congo Enterprise under Mr. Stanley', 'full_section_title': 'The Belgian Congo Enterprise under Mr. Stanley', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1879#article-16', 'issue_date': '01_09_1879', 'content': 'It is by no means an easy task to marshal the forces that are to evoke order from chaos, by triumphing over the obstacles that ignorance, selfishness, and indifference oppose to the spirit of progress, in its efforts to deal with communities and lands that have not in themselves the powers for regeneration, although they may be full of the natural elements upon which such powers may be exercised.

All are intended to be converted into first-class fortresses, equally suitable as a base for attack or defence. The French account for the measure by the necessity of barring the way to the German host, which might attempt to invade France *via* Belgium, now that the direct road to Paris is blocked by the additional works at Toul and Verdun; but the Belgians look upon the new border forts in a very different light, and denounce them as designs to assist the invasion of their country by the French. Certain it is that with these forts to serve as a base, the strong garrisons kept on the Belgian frontier by the French Government since the war might, at a moment's notice, set out for Brussels, and occupy that capital without running any serious risk.

Scott Keltie, F.R.G.S., gave the first of a series of three lectures on the ""Geography of Africa, with special reference to the exploration, commercial development, and political partition of that continent."" The lecture was illustrated by maps.\n\nMr. Scott Keltie began by remarking that during the past six years we had seen the bulk of a great continent parcelled out among a few great Powers. That continent was no new discovery. It was not a new world like America or Australia. It entered into the oldest traditions and the most ancient history. Long, indeed, before Greece entered the field, while yet Europe was the home of wandering barbarians, long even before Abraham left his father\'s fields, before the Phœnicians had settled themselves on the Syrian coast, one of the most wonderful civilisations on record had begun to work out its destiny on the banks of that Nile, the mystery of whose source, so long sought for, had been solved only within present memory. It was not the present business to discuss the origin or trace the history of Egypt. It was enough that the continent on which the oldest, or at least one of the oldest, civilisations was born and was developed through thousands of years, was even now less known than a continent discovered only 400 years ago, and had only during the last few years been taken seriously in hand by the peoples who had the making of the world\'s commerce and the world\'s history. It was only just 400 years since Columbus stumbled upon the New World, and yet what was in brief the history of America? It was now the home of 130,000,000 of people of European origin. It was, indeed, another Europe. The first British colonial settlement was planted in Australia little more than a century since, and it was only fifty years since that the continents there had had a free hand. Now they had 4,000,000 of people of European origin, mainly of British descent, whose trade was of the value of £120,000,000 sterling a year.\n\nThis was to be contrasted with what had taken place in Africa. The lecturer then proceeded to trace the progress of the knowledge of the African continent among those whose interests and enterprise had extended beyond their own homes.

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs. It shows nice powers of observation—great diligence—a clear appreciation of facts, and a mental daring that does not shrink from the great problems of the future of the various divisions of his race, on which the light of Christian civilisation is only now beginning to shine, and who are for the most part placed under circumstances most unfavourable to its increase. After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries. Showing us their actual condition, and exposing many errors of administration which are opposed to material development and social advancement, he views the whole in connexion with the resolutions of the late House of Commons Committee, 1865, recommending the preparing of the several people for self-government. He shows the great changes that must be induced and fostered to make such self-government possible, safe, or beneficial. Though he has evidently a deep and, we believe, a just faith in his race, he does not shut his eyes to any of the disadvantages of their actual position and the difficulties in the way of their progress toward Christianity, civilisation, and wealth. The book ought to be read and studied by all educated Africans, and we should like to see it have a large circulation in England, as we consider it calculated to arouse sympathies for Africa where they have never yet been felt, and to give them a vigorous impulse where they do already exist. Our space will not allow more at present, but we shall from time to time quote from and comment upon its contents. We cannot say it is perfect in style, but the faults are very venial ones, and such as we have no doubt an increased practice in writing will cause to disappear from those future works on this interesting subject of the West African Countries and Peoples which we hope to see from this author's pen.

The Phoenicians treated the part of Africa which they colonised as the British would, as the foundation of trade and commerce. The Phoenicians were followed, about 650 B.C., by the Greeks, who founded their first African colony Cyrene, on the coast of Tripoli. Then came the Carthaginians. They and the Greeks carried on a busy commerce all along the Mediterranean coast, far down to the Atlantic coast, to the mouth of the Red Sea. These were followed by the Romans, who continued an active career on the African coast until the decay of the Roman Empire.\n\nMr. Scott Keltie showed how little was known of the interior of Africa up to 150 A.D. by Ptolemy\'s map being thrown on to the sheet in the darkened theatre. This map, which was filled up haphazard fashion, gathered up, the lecturer said, all the knowledge of the continent which had accumulated during this long period of commercial activity — a knowledge which amounted to very little beyond the coasts and the Nile Valley. The next important period dealt with was the period of Arab invasion and the spread of the tenets of Mohammedanism — namely, from the seventh to the fifteenth century. In the early part of the fifteenth century commenced the ""glorious"" period of Portuguese activity, which lasted for some sixty years, during which the contour of the coast of Africa was completely laid down. This began the real modern partition of Africa, and the lecturer dwelt upon the effect which could be traced to Portuguese occupation of African territory — that occupation being marked by ruin rather than by enterprise. He rapidly traced the occupation of points of territory by Portuguese, Spanish, French, English, Dutch, Danish, and Germans, whose commerce was in ivory and slaves. He held that the opening up of the continent of Africa might be said to have begun with Bruce\'s travels in Abyssinia in the latter part of the eighteenth century. From that time until 1850 nearly the whole map of Africa became gradually filled up, and from 1850 down to the present day the southern half of the continent had received increasing attention at the hands of explorers until it also had had its main features laid down.

It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

We had buried our first-born there, a little boy of six years.\n\nBut poor Africa—what can be done for her? I rejoice in the success of Dr. Livingston, and of every other explorer and labourer in Africa; but much more need to be and can be done for her. 1. She needs missionaries and teachers, but these alone will not do the work needed. Accompanying them should be (2) farmers and mechanics, who can teach them civilization, for both must go together—civilization and Christianity: either without the other will fail; but both united will, with God's blessing, lift her up, and soon give her a place among the nations.\n\nShe has natural resources abundant. 1. The people are capable of being educated in the arts and sciences, in which they make rapid proficiency when an opportunity is provided. In managing business, mercantile or other, they manifest an ability equal to the whites. The richest men in Sierra Leone are negroes who were taken out of the slave ship. They make very efficient preachers, teachers, mechanics, farmers, &c., when instructed.\n\n2. The country is rich—very productive in many things needful for commerce and home consumption. Rice, Indian corn, and some smaller grains, suited to exportation, can be produced to any extent. Ginger, pepper, arrowroot, can be supplied to meet the wants of the world. Coffee and cotton of fine quality grow wild abundantly, and can be cultivated to any extent to supply Manchester and every cotton factory in Christendom. There only needs to do this to start it all along the Western Coast, and make a market for them, and the natives will go to producing them. They will work at what they can make the most money by. Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down.

Never yet has the future of Africa been so full of hope and light. Here, too, there is a north and a south struggling—not for supremacy over each other, but for the regeneration of a continent. In Algeria the French are fast displacing the torpid vestiges of Moorish sway, and are transforming a fertile and healthful country into a lesser France. Where the Moslem, for five centuries, forbade Christian foot to land—where, under the cold shade of the crescent, man has so long wrapt the earth in lethargy—not far from where heathenism crouched under Carthaginian ramparts—on the very spot where a power that imperilled Europe and conquered Spain, held rule thereafter—a prosperous Christian community, great in every element of strength, is now established. Within twenty years this French colony has so grown and prospered, that it is now the home of 200,000 Europeans, consumes seven millions sterling of imports, and ships three millions sterling in the form of exports, such as corn, tobacco, cattle, fruit, oil, and minerals. That the French influence in Algeria is for good, cannot we think be disputed. From the coast to the confines of the Sahara that vigorous and vivacious people are imparting to North Africa quite a different character, and are literally making the wilderness blossom like the rose. But a yet more interesting work goes on in Egypt. Capital is flowing there from Western Europe in marvellous measure. Vast have been the benefits and the material wealth secured to Egypt by the fact of its being the highway to the East, they are as nothing compared with the blessings that are about to be conferred on it by the interposition of foreign influence, and the growing discernment and wider knowledge of those who rule Egypt. Possessed of a soil of perennial richness, calling for little culture, and naturally irrigated, the valley of the Nile, which is as prolific now as it was in Pharaoh's time, is already yielding largely in cotton and corn. Tenacious though the people may be of old customs and traditions, much of their dogged Orientalism is breaking down before the resistless forces of the age—the constant friction caused by the ever-flowing stream of western life that permeates Egypt. We say nothing of the gigantic canal scheme, which, whether it fails or succeeds—and in the interests of our common progress we hope for the latter—has enriched Egypt by the expenditure in it of millions of money. The extraordinary extension of cotton culture there—the rapid covering of the soil by a most valuable crop—the establishment of mills and factories for the better manipulation of local products—the commencement of steam traffic down the Nile, and the probability that before long a railway traversing the valley where as yet the shades of Thebes, of Karnak, and of Abou Simbel have had the desert in all its grim silence to themselves—will penetrate into Abyssinia, not only draining of their natural wealth those lower districts, but tapping the yet more varied fields that lie beyond—these are but some of the onward symptoms that are making Egypt a great power for good, and that will exercise a most beneficent pressure upon the savage kingdoms of the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1865-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1865#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.634, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Letter from North Carolina, United States', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. FitzGerald, many a midnight have you paced your room with tears in your eyes, weeping for Africa.

They knew then as much of interior Africa as is known now after the great exploits of Livingstone and Stanley. There is a map in the Vatican, 300 years old, which gives the general physical relief and the river and lake systems of Africa with more or less accuracy; but the Arab geographers of a century before had described the mountain system, the great lakes, and the course of the Nile. Just about the time that Portugal was establishing a great empire on that continent, America was discovered, and it became the seat of Portuguese Power. Neither Egyptian, Carthaginian, Persian, or Roman influence was allowed to establish itself on that continent. It would seem that no solution of the African problem was to come from alien sources. Africans were not to share the fate of other dark races who have come in contact with the European. Europe was diverted to the Western Hemisphere. The energies of that conquering race were spent in building up a home for themselves on this side. Africa followed in chains.\n\nThe Negro race was to be preserved for a special work in the future. It is probable that if foreign races had been allowed to enter their country they would have been destroyed. So they were brought over to be helpers in America and at the same time to be preserved. Slavery would seem to be a strange school in which to preserve a people; but God has a way of salting as well as purifying by fire. The Europeans found in America an aboriginal race unable to co-operate with them in the labours required for the construction of the new civilisation. The Indians would not work, and have suffered the consequences of that indisposition: they have passed away. To take their place as accessories in the work to be done, the African was brought, who could work and would work, and could endure the climatic conditions of a new southern country, which Europeans could not. If Europe brought the Negro, Africa furnished the hands for the work which has been achieved. But when the new continent was opened Africa was closed.

Liberia has been a black republic for forty years; Sierra Leone has been a negro colony for a century; and it cannot be denied that each of these communities has made very gratifying progress. Yet, upon Dr. Blyden's own showing, that progress has been but partial, he still has to complain of his countrymen's imitativeness and lack of backbone. The responsibility for this, undoubtedly, rests to some extent upon the unsuitable character of the education which the civilized negroes have received; but it is more to the purpose to remember that three generations is a very brief period in the development of a pagan people. How slow the work of civilization in Liberia has been may be seen from the fact that, whereas there are some twenty thousand Christian negroes in the republic, there are more than a million who are pagans. And now we inevitably come to the primary question of all: whether or not the presumed racial inferiority of the negro is proved. Dr. Blyden pleads eloquently for his fellows, and triumphantly asks: How could an inferior race have produced Toussaint L'Ouverture? The question is not unnatural, but it is far from logical. The matter, as it fashions itself to us, is, and is likely to remain for a long time to come, an open one. The negro has, as yet, enjoyed no sufficient opportunity of proving either his mental equality with or his inferiority to the white. The experience of Sierra Leone and Liberia, so far as it has gone, has been in his favour; what we know of his moral history in that other black republic, Hayti, and in the United States, is at the best negative. As time goes on, the question, which is far more momentous than would appear to the unthinking, will settle itself. Emigration from America to Liberia, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, is proceeding satisfactorily; and Dr. Blyden states that 200,000 negroes in the United States are prepared to return to the land of their fathers. But colonization by private effort is, at the best, exceedingly slow; and in this instance it is perhaps well that it is so, since the gradual settlement of Liberia is far more likely to provide material for a strong and healthy State than a hasty rush would be. Social reformers for many a year to come will watch the experiment, as they have watched it in the past, with keen interest. The chief danger lies, as Dr. Blyden constantly points out, in the tendency to Europeanize the negro—to supersede customs and practices which are useful and often necessary in Africa by customs utterly out of place there. The ill-directed zeal of some of the less reflective missionaries has, no doubt, been to blame for some of this; but there is, we fancy, very little to complain of upon this head now. Let it be once proved beyond all doubt that negroes can found flourishing colonies, can develop the limitless resources of the continent which has been the cradle of their race; and, above all, that they can govern themselves prudently and self-reliantly,—and there will open up before the black man the assurance of a future as splendid and far-reaching as any that ever presented itself to a white conqueror."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1887#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE ""COMING"" CONTINENT.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In an article, entitled ""Africa for Africans,"" published in a magazine issued in Washington, U.S.A., the vast possibilities of progress and development possessed by this continent are so eloquently and aptly set forth that we quote the passage *in extenso*:\n\n""Africa is to-day the object of more interest on the part of a larger number of people than any other quarter of the globe. England, France, Portugal, Germany, and Italy are attempting to obtain titles to the country.

Her Chamber of Deputies has granted the De Brazza mission, by a vote of 449 to 3, a credit of a million and a quarter of francs. The Portuguese Government has appointed explorers and examined the Congo country, and assumes to exercise control over all the territory at the mouth of the Congo. The German Reichstag has increased its annual appropriation for the exploration of Africa. Italy has despatched a party to Abyssinia for geographical and mercantile purposes. She has also concluded treaties which promise to make Assab a centre of commerce. The Sultan of Morocco has authorized Spain to take possession of Santa Cruz del Mar, and the Sultan of Zanzibar has purchased six superior steamers to constitute a regular coast service, in the interest of commerce and for the suppression of the slave-trade. The International African Association, which owes its origin to the philanthropic initiative of Leopold II., King of the Belgians, has received large subscriptions and pushed forward exploring expeditions to start and equip the line of hospitable and scientific stations which are to bound the East and West Coast, and form a civilizing girdle around Central Africa. And the results following the explorations of Livingstone and Stanley and De Brazza are attracting the attention of the civilized world. What was a \'Dark Continent,\' by the indomitable energy of these explorers, seems likely to prove the richest quarter of the globe.

The great future wealth of the interior plateaux will certainly lie in their mineral deposits, the riches of the West Coast region lie in its numerous and valuable vegetable products, of which the most striking are palm oil, and ground nuts, benniseed, shea butter, rubber, gums, spices, cotton, dyes, and valuable timbers, among which ebony occupies a prominent place. With regard to animal products, I might mention ivory and monkey skins. Whereas some of the great races of the interior speak languages which connect them with the Hamitic and Semitic families. The native inhabitants of the West Coast are all that there is of most typically Negro in character; yet I do not mean they are races of particularly low development; on the contrary, the typical Negro is a fine specimen of man, and is by no means as low in his mental state as the races of Polynesia and America. I may cite the Kru tribes of that portion of West Africa which is known as Liberia, a country inhabited by an industrious, energetic, hardworking, stalwart population of free men. An element of heterogeneous ex-slave settlers among the tribes of the coast may be found in some parts of the Colonies of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos. These people represent the Nemesis which invariably follows national crimes. We and our American children indulged to a greater extent than any other European nation in the African slave trade, and, as our wrong-doing was violent and exaggerated, so to a certain extent was the abrupt reparation which followed. Although I would not minimise the work done by our blockade on the West Coast, the abolition of the slave trade was more effectually brought about by the abolition of slavery in the United States of America. One result of our suppression of the slave trade in West Africa has not been altogether advantageous. I refer to the Slave Colonies established at Sierra Leone, and at Fernando Po and other points on the coast. It may be taken that the slaves exported from any district are the least worthy people in it, and the result is that a large proportion of this population is descended from the sweepings of West Africa, and has not yet passed through sufficient generations to eliminate the ancestral badness of its progenitors. So, although here and there a negro has shown what the race can attain to under favourable circumstances, still the bulk of the ""S\'a Leone"" people who are scattered up and down the coast are of an undesirable character, and the cause of indiscriminating blame on the part of superficial observers which is most unjustly laid on the shoulders of the entire population of West Africa; whereas many of these races are superior in intelligence, enterprise, and integrity to any of our negro fellow-subjects in South Africa or the West Indies. What admirable recruits to civilised society can be obtained from many of these people may be instanced by such men as Bishop Crowther, Archdeacons Johnson and Crowther, Samuel Lewis, and other divines and lawyers and officials in West Africa, who are on a par with well-educated white men, and in some cases superior in intelligence and acquirements to the whites with whom they come in contact. It is absurd, however, to regard the Negro race, as a whole, on the same average level as the European—they are far below us. Take them in their native wilds, and they are what we were before Julius Caesar landed in this country; indeed, in many cases they are not 2,000 years behind us, but 10,000. They are in the condition of some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and Gaul, and Spain, whose history we can dimly spell out from their implements and scattered remains, who were undoubtedly cannibals and probably naked, and leading a brutish life. Yet we can in a few years drag them from the condition that prevailed 2,000 years before Christ into the year of grace 1889. We can take a cannibal from the Upper Cross River, and transport him to the centres of civilisation in England or America, where everything represents the utmost result of our present development; but what will be usually the result both with the individual and the race? The savage mind will be unable to grasp and assimilate one-third of the wonders presented to his consideration, and will probably even suffer from the shock. We cannot expect the negroes of West Africa to become all at once intelligent, self-governing people. For many years the white races must be their guardians and educators, and we must educate the negro by force if necessary, leaving him to understand us afterwards, when we have raised him to a condition to do so. This, then, is our mission in West Africa: to instruct the natives that idleness is the eighth deadly sin; next, to so instruct the native as to the existence of the resources of this country; and, lastly, to educate him in the principles of civilised society, and so assimilate his views with our own that he and we may be bound together with the ties of commerce and Empire.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sierra Leone is not a colony about which we can boast very much. It is about 102 years old, thus considerably younger than the Gambia, which almost ranks with Newfoundland as being one of the very first British possessions abroad. Sierra Leone, however, has not much to show for its century of British rule. Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary.

Samadu has several times fought the French on the Senegambian frontier, but of late he is said to have concluded peace with them.

It exports palm oil, palm kernels, rubber, gum, camwood, besides skins and benniseed and ground nuts.\n\nLiberia is British in language, and to a great extent in such culture as it possesses, although it enjoys an independent Government.

It is an admirable volume for all who desire general information respecting that great continent, into the dense darkness of which the light of civilization and Christianity has begun to penetrate, through the devoted exertions of missionaries and scientific explorers.

The distinction between peasants and sailors, or 'bushmen' and 'fishmen' was of long standing; but the volume of the slave trade in the eighteenth century in this hitherto relatively spared area stengthened the position of the 'bushmen'. However, the famous group of 'five Kru towns' which seem to have come fairly recently (about the sixteenth century) from the interior, played a special role in the slave trade. Among them, the two communities - peasants and sailors - were closely integrated. This district round the Setta-Kru, which formed the heart of Krawi country, forged special links with Sierra Leone, which brought a new impetus for culture change. It seems that, from the 1780s onwards, many boats used to take on 'fishmen' as interpreters or deckhands before going on into the Gulf of Guinea. This movement, interrupted by the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, started again strongly after 1815, when the clandestine slave trade co-existed with the incipient legitimate trade. The Kru soon established themselves in large numbers in Freetown and then in Monrovia as labourers and woodcutters. They remained cohesive, but adopted aspects of Creole culture as well. The coastal lineages ('fishmen' or 'Krumen') used their connections with the interior to mobilize labour. Throughout the nineteenth century, ships rarely sailed east along the coast without taking on 'Krumen', and this activity gradually spread as far as the Sassandra. It changed somewhat in nature but not in extent after 1850, when steam largely replaced sail.\nEuropean activity became integrated with the ancient community of coastal fishermen which stretched from the Krawi east to the Gold Coast; it was symbolized by the worship of the famous 'Big Devil' of Hedie, near the mouth of the Cavally, which drew people from as far as the Alladian country on the Ivory Coast. Sailing ships usually dropped south away from the coast on their westward, return voyages to avoid contrary winds and current, but this caused no problem for the Krumen, who landed far to the east with their pay. They found little difficulty in returning home.

If they were less farsighted, less fortunate or less well-advised, they would see their traditional enemies siding with the invader and would themselves assume an attitude of resistance, which could all too easily end in military defeat, the deposition of chiefs, the loss of land to the native allies of the occupying power, possibly even to the political fragmen› tation of the society or state ...

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions.

Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'. France, he continued, was guaranteeing 'the economic growth and human development' of its colonies. 2"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading.

In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority. Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Models of African initiatives and reactions', 'content': ""War-weariness and insecurity contributed greatly to the acceptance of British wardship or alliance on the part of several African polities and individuals.

It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.\nJohn D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty. To them, there could be no compromise on that, and indeed many of the leaders of these states chose to die on the battlefield, go into voluntary flight or face exile rather than surrender their sovereignty without a struggle.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Only few of the colonial administrators seemed to have understood how to manage the uneasy relationship which existed between the 'traditional' and the new African elites on the one hand, and between these two sets of elites and the colonial regimes on the other.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained.

Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

Those involved in the movement tended to see themselves as heirs to a long tradition of struggle whose roots go back to the beginning of this century, if not earlier.

Those African rulers who have been mistakenly termed collaborators were those who thought that the best way of safeguarding their sovereignty or even regaining the sovereignty that they might have lost to some African power previous to the arrival of the Europeans was not to collaborate but rather to ally with the European invaders. A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation.

It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there.

Contrary to what happened in Europe, the state was created before the cultural nations that would make it a meaningful political community were welded together. It is in this sense that one should take James Coleman's observation that: ... the drive behind African nationalism in many instances is not the consciousness of belonging to a distinct politico-cultural unit which is seeking to protect or assert itself, but rather it is the movement of racially-conscious modernists seeking to create new political and cultural nationalities out of the heterogenous people within the artificial boundaries imposed by the European master ...

That nationalism in Africa is a dynamic, ongoing phenomenon is clear from the extensive literature on themes like nation-building and irredentism.

Consequently, through the media of numerous international conferences, visitations, and technical missions, many Africans were touched by the 'Tuskegee Spirit' or drew upon Tuskegee's and other American black resources."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 461, 'article_title': 'RE-ELECTION FOR FOUR YEARS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN AS PRESIDENT', 'full_section_title': 'RE-ELECTION FOR FOUR YEARS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN AS PRESIDENT', 'last_edit_date': '11-22-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1864#article-0', 'issue_date': '23_11_1864', 'content': ""[November 23, 1864.]\n\n## CONTENTS.\n\n| Page | Page |\n|------|------|\n| Latest Intelligence—Re-election for Four Years of Abraham Lincoln as President | 60 |\n| West Coast of Africa | 60 |\n| River Gambia | 60 |\n| Sierra Leone | 61 |\n| Liberia | 61 |\n| Cape Coast | 61 |\n| Christiansborg, Accra | 62 |\n| Cape Coast | 63 |\n| Lagos | 63 |\n| Madagascar | 63 |\n| Cape Coast Castle Native Female School, Gold Coast, West Africa | 64 |\n| General Observations | 64 |\n| Subscriptions to African-Aid Society | 64 |\n| The African-Aid Society and the Missionary Societies | 64 |\n| Navigation of the River Niger | 65 |\n| Sierra Leone Exhibition | 66 |\n| Treatment of Kroomen in Her Majesty's Ships | 66 |\n| The Yellow Fever at Bermuda | 66 |\n| Earl Russell on Africa | 67 |\n| Lord Stanley on African Affairs | 67 |\n| The Times on Africa | 67 |\n| Parliamentary Papers | 68 |\n| Liverpool Cotton Market | 69 |\n| Fatality at Sea | 69 |\n| Showers of Frogs | 69 |\n\n## LATEST INTELLIGENCE.—Nov. 22.\n\n### RE-ELECTION FOR FOUR YEARS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN AS PRESIDENT.\n\n**New York, Nov. 9, Morning.**—Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee, have been elected President and Vice-President.\n\n(Via Halifax).\n\n**New York, Nov. 10.**—Lincoln has carried every state except Kentucky, Delaware, and New Jersey.

The article attributes to our client conduct so inhuman and abominable that he is most anxious that the public should be freely informed what the facts really were. We have, therefore, to request that you will give this letter as great prominence in your paper as the editorial article in your issue to which we have referred. In the month of June last, the Biafra put into Grand Cess, to land some Kroo passengers, and, as usual, canoes came off from the shore to land the passengers and their effects. Kroo passengers learned from those coming from ashore that there was some dispute between the town from which the canoes had come and the town to which they wished to go, and where they resided. Not knowing how far this dispute had gone, or whether actual fighting had taken place, the Kroo passengers were afraid to land, and asked Captain Rattray to wait until canoes should arrive from their own town. The ship had already been delayed, waiting for canoes, and was behind time; so that it was uncertain when canoes would, if at all, come from their town. Captain Rattray informed them it was impossible for him to wait, but he offered to take them to Bassa or Monrovia.\n\nto land them there, and give them a note to the Captain of the next returning steamer to take them back. This arrangement was entirely satisfactory to the passengers, and they were landed by the steamer's boats at Monrovia, where the Captain gave them the promised note for their passages home by the Company's next steamer, giving them, in addition, a week's rations of bread and meat. From this you will see that Captain Rattray, instead of treating the men in the cruel manner attributed to him, treated them in the best possible way, and, for their accommodation, went much farther than there was any legal call upon him. We may add, that we have in our possession a duly signed and attested certificate to the effect that there is no truth whatever in the article you have quoted. We would only add, that the Biafra never was at Settra Kroo at all on the voyage referred to.—\n\nWe are, Sir, your obedient servants,  \n**Hill, Dickinson, & Co.**\n\nIn inserting the above letter of Captain Rattray, we beg to express our deep and sincere regret that we should have been misled into copying from the Monrovia Observer, and publishing in our columns, with editorial remarks on the same, the false and calumnious statement of which Captain Rattray so justly complains. We can imagine the pain it must have caused him, and tender our apologies for having been thus instrumental in inflicting it.""}]","[{'document_title': 'Government Notices at Cape Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '### TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.\n\nAccra, Gold Coast, West Africa, December 10, 1865.\n\nSir,—Accra has hitherto been noted as one of the very few places in Western Africa where the white man and the black man pulled together better than they are generally known to do in almost all other parts. There may be many ways of accounting for this, but no doubt it must be ascribed chiefly to the fact that from time immemorial the white men who came to sojourn at Accra, whether Danes, Dutch, or English, were almost invariably of a superior class.\n\nTimes are, however, changed; the English gentleman is not now so frequently met with here as in days of yore.\n\nIn those days the white man lived in harmony with the black man. Being a gentleman, he did not consider himself degraded by associating on terms of perfect equality with the coloured man whose education, intellectual attainments, and self-respect entitled him to the respect of those whose esteem is of any value.\n\nHaving in view why exact English gentlemen deem qualifications, sufficient to entitle the Frenchman, the Turk, the American, Indian, or the Ashantee to move in their society, and having that feeling which pervades all real gentlemen, those white men, when they encountered black men possessing intellectual abilities and other qualifications not inferior to their own, were only too ready to receive them into their society, and too glad to be admitted into that of the natives. The European being a man of education and good breeding felt quite as much at ease in the society of the educated black man as in that of his brethren at home; he knew that his companion, though black, yet for all that, was a gentleman; and that was quite sufficient for him, and vice versa.\n\nNow-a-days, things are not exactly the same. The white men of the ancient type certainly do visit this country and sojourn for a period, but they do not, as of old, make it their home. They make their money and are off again whence they came, or if they be Government officials their term of service expires and away they depart.\n\nThe English gentleman has been to a certain extent superseded by the English Gent, a distinct class too well known and too well described and caricatured by their own countrymen, to render a description necessary here.\n\nThese men, whom the rage for the rapid acquisition of wealth has induced to visit our parts, or others to send them here to acquire wealth for them, arrive imbued with ideas common to all ignorant men—that is to say, if beings whose minds have such a limited scope can be said to have any ideas of their own at all, and not picked up second-hand from others only a shade less ignorant than themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1866#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AN AFRICAN TOUR IN THE CAMEROON MOUNTAIN DISTRICT.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Once away in the forest, we took out some tobacco, and made ready so many leaves for each of several head-men that we should have to pass, and we determined at whose town we should sleep, and planned to walk quickly, without stopping, through each village, the interpreter and guide to shove the tobacco into the head-men\'s hands, and pass on, saying where we were going, and that we were in a hurry, as the day was drawing to a close. The guide and interpreter walked before, the carriers followed them, and I brought up the rear. I was compelled to do this all the way going, as otherwise the Kroo boys would have straggled behind or run away. By this arrangement we managed to pass through four villages without being stopped for a moment. After passing the largest of the four, some people came close up to me, calling the guide and interpreter to stop—that the tobacco was not enough. But they were well in advance, walking steadily on, and pretended not to hear. The people never supposed I heard, and so we escaped a palaver. About half-past four we got to Monyanga. There we were to stay the night, and the next morning, all being well, enter the country we had come to see. The head-man of Monyanga and his son were fine, friendly men; gave us two houses, took the whole care of providing and cooking food for us, and sent a man to show us the brook to wash. We were now really in the country interior to Rumby, rather more than half a day\'s walk from Balundu, which is the principal trading place of Yellow Duke of Calabar, and where that celebrated man was at the time. We were only two or three hours\' walk from Ekumbi, the place we had been trying to reach, and on the direct road for the interior.\n\nWe were to the north of the mountain. On looking behind we saw it to the south of us. We were astonished to see that the posts of a new house that was being erected were well charred to about four inches above the ground. We asked why they did that, when they replied, ""To make the posts last long; that when charred they would not cut."" I had never seen this done by natives before, except in imitation of white men. Another peculiar thing we noticed was that a country rope was used to mark the line of the posts. The people said these things were their own customs, and they had not been taught by any one. My letter is too long already, so I must jump to the conclusion. At night the head-man and his son arranged that we should leave carriers and boxes with them, and, taking one box only, we should go, with a man they would give us, into Ekumbi, and as the place was large, there being three head-men, we should stay one night, and return the day after. The next morning we had to wait for breakfast, which was cooked for us by our host.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs. Although one of the reports said that the Natives would rise against the Germans and drive them out of the river, it was not believed by the English that anything of the kind would be attempted, as the Germans a few years ago gave the Natives a lesson of their strength which they are not likely to forget.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MR.

The coast population have hitherto resented all attempts of Europeans to communicate with the natives of the interior, as the latter would thus be able to dispense with their services as middlemen. Lieutenants Kund and Tappenbeck met with serious resistance, and both were wounded some time ago as they were pushing their way inland: indeed, the latter has succumbed to his sufferings. However, the German Colonial Administration determined to push on reconnoitring expeditions. With this task Dr. Zuitgraff was intrusted, and since 1886 he has made five exhibitions to the coast region, collecting information which has enabled him to organise an expedition into the far interior. He met with many difficulties from the natives, who were hostile to European intrusion, but succeeded in reaching Yola, on the Binué, and in pushing to a considerable distance to the east. Dr. Zuitgraff described the results of his expedition at a recent meeting of the Berlin Geographical Society. He started first at Christmas 1887, and founded various stations in the interior.

Lord Aberdare presided, and in moving the adoption of the report, observed that the circumstances in which they held that meeting were somewhat exceptional, though not in any discouraging sense. During the past year many of their managers had been engaged in works of diplomacy and exploration, almost to the exclusion of commercial work. One reason would, doubtless, suffice to explain this state of things. They would remember that the eminent traveller, the late Dr. Nachtigal, was chosen by the German Government to take measures to satisfy the desire of the German people to found a colonial empire, and they might remember with what secrecy and expedition the measures of the German Government were taken, and how they contrived to anticipate the action of the English Government, and to take possession of the Cameroons. He was sure that no one would be jealous of a country so great as Germany, having so very small an amount of colonial possessions, pursuing a policy which we had so long followed, and with such marvellous success; but the lesson was one which could not be overlooked. The directors had felt that it was necessary to strengthen the position of the company in these rivers, and to prevent the action of any other foreign State from injuring a trade which they and those amalgamated with them had been creating, with so many years of labour and at so much cost. The result of their deliberations was that it was necessary to enter into treaties with the chiefs of all those portions of the Niger and the Binué with which they were then dealing, or with which they were likely to be dealing within any reasonable time; and in doing that they had not only extended their operations up those two rivers, but also laterally into the adjoining territories. They had formed treaties with nearly 100 potentates of various descriptions—some small, others rulers of kingdom, not inferior either in size or in population to second-rate European Powers. In the Binué especially they had travelled along the line of the principal stream, and had also discovered and navigated tributaries of very considerable extent, which had brought them into communication with regions previously unknown, and with people who, they had every reason to believe, would desire to trade with them. In these efforts, which they had been so suddenly called upon to make—instead of making them gradually, as would have been done in ordinary circumstances—very great demands had been made on their managers. Mr. David M'Intosh, their general agent in Africa, was selected by Her Majesty's Government to represent this country as Vice-Consul in those regions—a position which had added very much to his weight in dealing with the local chiefs. Lord Aberdare then referred to measures which had been taken, resulting in their having made arrangements with three other companies which had been in existence in the Binué in the last three years."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-06-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1885#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'But, as a rule, the most healthy, because the most industrious, of white residents in Western Africa, including the Gold Coast, are Englishmen, Americans, Germans, and Dutchmen.

Burton, has told us that last year, when surveying the Akankoo concession, he worked for days together up to his middle in water, and lived! Captain Burton himself, in a letter written in February last to the directors of the Guinea Coast Gold Mining Company, speaking of Apollonia, says ""During the hot hours the doctor—that is, the sea breeze—blows freshly; the evening temperature is delicious, and during the cool dewy nights we found blankets necessary.""\n\nI visited all the mines then being worked, and saw upwards of thirty Europeans, of various nationalities, who both worked and lived. I also saw very large numbers of natives, as well as several hundreds of Kroomen, who worked regularly, both day and night, at the mines, and in transporting heavy machinery and other goods from Axim to the different mines at and near Takwah. I travelled partly by hammock, partly by boat and canoe, as well as on foot, over Wassaw, Egwira, Apollonia, Axim, and Apatim, meeting hundreds of native carriers transporting provisions, pieces of heavy machinery, and other articles, by road and river, without overseers, and by whose means, aided by Kroomen, everything now at the mines had been carried there, with little loss by accident or theft. I slept in native huts without doors or fastenings; and at Axim, my bedroom door and windows remained open day and night; yet the whole extent of my loss by theft, during six months, was one plated table-fork stolen on board a steam launch!

Either the entire administration and commerce of the Colony must be placed on a broader basis, and then a prosperous development of the Colony in every direction is expected with certainty; or the old course is kept up, and then the Colony will meet with unavoidable ruin. According to the present system the Colony must cover all its administrative expenses from the current receipts. These receipts consist, almost exclusively, in the duties levied at the coast. The income of the duty increases and decreases with the commerce in the Colony. German trade in Cameroons, however, is going backward, in consequence of the falling of prices for African products and of the trading monopoly of the tribes on the coast, which more than doubles, often quintuples, the price of the goods from the interior, thereby limiting the intercourse of the coast with the interior. If this continues, the end can easily be foreseen. The Colony will be less capable to recoup its costs of administration—it will require more and more support from the Empire and yet it will not improve. Within the frame of the present administrative system there is no means to check this sinking movement. For the cancer the Colony is suffering from, the monopoly of the Dualla, can only be cured by using stronger and powerful means. To do this the present administration is perfectly incapable. Its means only go so far as to carry out on the coast the most necessary police functions and to exert a limited jurisdiction. This limited power of the German administration does not reach beyond the coast. The armed force consists of a few black policemen in the gun-boat. But, like the Arabs in East Africa, the Dualla in Kamerun will not give up their predatory trade voluntarily; they will have to be forced to restrict themselves to legal commerce and to allow the Europeans to enter their commercial districts—the endeavour to force this, miscarried in East Africa on account of the lack of sufficient power, causing rebellion; a similar proceeding in Kamerun would also have similar consequences. If in East Africa half only of the means of power displayed later on would have been put into requisition at the beginning, a sedition would never have taken place; the Empire would have saved many millions, and the development of the Colony would have taken an undisturbed course. The predictions of the experts are similar now with respect to Kamerun. With relatively small protective forces the entire opposition of the Dualla could be broken. These protective forces would be sufficient to garrison a number of stations on the routes in the interior, facilitating to the German trade a safe pushing forward to the Hinterland. These 200 men could do as much service to the German trade in Kamerun as the 2,000 men of the protective forces in East Africa. It is said that the number of the latter is to be considerably decreased.

Besides illegal slavery, there was extensively practised in Africa a system of native despotism which it was very desirable should be abolished. In 1876 nobody seemed to take any notice of Africa, and the exportation of India-rubber from Zanzibar amounted to something under £20,000. Now the amount was about £250,000! With respect to ill-health in that continent, he had found that some of the native treatments were by no means to be despised, and many of our English doctors could take a leaf out of their book. The record of men who had travelled through Africa and endured every conceivable kind of hardship proved that Africa had been cursed by the idea of its unhealthiness, a reproach which it did not deserve. The great thing required, however, was adequate communication. African travelling, under present circumstances, meant, at the outside, fifty miles in a week. At the present time every mile of railroad laid down in Africa drove a dozen nails into the coffin of the slave-trade, to say nothing of the immense impetus to trade and commerce which would thus be afforded. From Cairo right away to the Albert Nyanza was navigable water. There would be no difficulty in overcoming the obstacles of cataracts, &c., which modern engineering would easily surmount. The central high plateau of Africa was, to a great extent, in British hands, and offered the most important means of repressing the slave-trade in future. Every slave working at the present time was in direct defiance of the Act of 1873. Mr. Rhodes\' great railway, which would reach Zambesia within eight years, should be kept under British control, as native treaties were more or less uncertain. In 1876 they could have obtained all that is now German territory by holding up their hands. The Germans, however, are practically locked in. A dispute had been going on with Portugal as to whether the Zambesi was an open highway. Fortunately, owing to the twenty-one miles strip of land granted by England to Germany these two powers would be as one on the question, and in future arbitration claim the Zambesi as an open highway. A wise system of emigration should be conducted. He would like to see Indian planters transferred there, and Chinese too. Africa offered an excellent opening for the English working man, and it was desirable that the Government should protect its emigrants. The dangers of Africa were largely dwelt on nowadays, and its advantages were put in the rear. This was the reason why the development of that great continent was so far behind hand.\n\nThe following resolution was proposed by Admiral Field, M.P., seconded by Mr. Johnson (of the Stanley Falls, Congo):—', 'last_edit_date': '1890-07-18', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1890#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ARREST OF AN AFRICAN CHIEF BY THE GERMANS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The British & African Steam Navigation Company’s steamer Cameroon arrived in the Mersey on April 28, from the west and south-west coasts of Africa.

1406,The people of the Gold Coast sought to integrate traditional governance structures into the colonial system by advocating for participatory governance and involving local leaders in decision-making.,"The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of the efforts by the people of the Gold Coast to integrate traditional governance structures into the colonial system by advocating for participatory governance and involving local leaders in decision-making. The General History of Africa highlights initiatives such as the transformation of the Okwahuman Council into a representative body of chiefs and commoners, and the actions of the Kwahu asafo company, which compelled the Omanhene of Kwahu to sign a document regulating political and economic affairs, later ratified as the Magna Carta. These efforts illustrate a push for participatory governance and the involvement of local leaders. The establishment of the United Gold Coast Convention, representing a rapprochement between new and traditional elites, further supports this claim. However, challenges such as the colonial administration's tendency to cultivate conflict between traditional and new elites, and the imposition of indirect rule, which often subordinated local leaders to colonial authorities, are also noted. Similarly, The African Times articles document petitions from local kings, chiefs, and headmen to colonial authorities, expressing dissatisfaction with the lack of representation in decision-making processes and the imposition of taxes and ordinances without their input. These petitions requested the appointment of representatives and the formation of municipal councils, indicating a desire for participatory governance. References to the Fanti Confederation as a potential organization for native governance suggest an interest in integrating traditional structures into the colonial framework. Nonetheless, the articles also highlight challenges such as the imposition of colonial authority over traditional practices and the lack of acknowledgment of local leaders' authority.

Modifications along European lines were expected in matters such as justice and taxation. 11 'The great task of indirect rule,' wrote Lugard's biographer in an article defending his policy, 'is to hold the ring, to preserve a fair field within which Africans can strike their own balance between conservatism and adaptation.'$^{12}$ That task depended in large measure on the knowledge that European administrators had of local customs and institutions - and, of course, on the willingness of the native authorities to make such adjust› ments towards modernization within the context of their own institutions."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.629, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'Politics and nationalism in British West Africa > Rural politics or rural mass nationalism in the inter-war period', 'content': ""As recent research in Ghana has shown, two main instruments were fashioned in these areas for the attainment of these ends, namely the traditional instrument of the asafo companies, i.e. permanent organizations in Akan-speaking societies of commoners for military and social purposes outside the control of the traditional rulers or political elite, and new associations such as the Cocoa Farmers Association and the Gold Coast Federation of Cocoa Farmers formed in 1910 and 1928 respectively.

All these measures which gave the traditional rulers powers to collect revenue and to impose court fines as were unknown before, were, according to Stone, 'an attempt to make the chiefs a living part of the machinery of (colonial) government'. Economically, the era saw the alternation of periods of boom with those of recession and inflation - the latter in 1915-17, 1929-30 and the second half of the 1930s. It also saw the spread of the cocoa industry into the rural areas especially of Akuapem and Akyem Abuakwa which led to the emergence of an increasing number of rich young farmers and long-distance traders. Socially, the period also saw the spread of elementary education into the rural areas and while some of the products of these schools drifted into the urban centres, others stayed behind and took to either farming or petty trading. With all these changes in their socio› economic status, these rural people began to demand a corresponding change in their political status and especially representation on the state and provincial councils, a demand which the ordinances mentioned above made steadily impossible. The principal objectives of the rural folk, then, were to acquire representation on these councils and, above all, to curb the increasing powers of their traditional rulers and the district commis› sioners and abolition or reduction of some of the fines and taxes being imposed by them."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.634, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The most important and most discussed African component was the local chief. Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The colonial regimes were no exception to the truism that every ad› ministration makes use of intermediary structures, largely for reasons of economy and effectiveness.

Indeed, in the search for such authority structures and personnel, the colonial officials often created new ones which they could understand and use. Such were the 'warrant chiefs' of South-eastern Nigeria, the native authorities among the Maasai in Tanganyika (now Tanzania), and in parts of Uganda outside Buganda, and most of the so-called chiefs (chefs de paille) under the French, Belgians and the Portuguese. But even then, the elites so recruited to sustain colonial rule were hardly any better treated than the Africans who were raised through education in the colonial system. Like the new educated elites, the 'traditional' rulers fell between two stools.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators. There is among the whole of this badly payed and very wretched elite - as remote from indigenous society, from which it has been driven out, as it is from European society into which it is not admitted - a feeling of disillusionment, discontent and bitterness which it would prove dangerous to be unaware of. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""In theory such indirect administration also applied to French colonial activities south of the Sahara, but in fact practice was at severe variance with it.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration.

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure. The point is that colonial Africans were probably not unaware of the elementary fact that accepting \'new forms [would] increase the range of alternatives\'$^{3}$ available to them.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.617, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""in the exercise of local authority.

In this open opposition the traditional rulers could not join them. Their continued survival depended on the colonial power and this tied their hands. Also for the most part the traditional rulers were not sufficiently educated to participate meaningfully in the highfaluting debates of the new elites. In any case if they accepted the arguments of the new elites, they would be consigning themselves to second or even third place. Because they did not side with the new elites, the latter regarded them as the lackeys of imperialism. They in turn regarded the new elites as revolutionaries who wanted to destroy im› memorial custom and turn the world upside down.\nTo make matters worse the two were driven by imperialist propaganda into engaging in a struggle over who spoke for the people. The new elites said they did. This the traditional rulers denied, claiming the honour for themselves. The colonial administration agreed with them. The kind of acrimony which this disagreement at times generated could be seen in the dispute between the chief of Akyem-Abuakwa in the Gold Coast, Nana Sir Ofori Atta and the leaders of the National Congress of British West Africa in the 1920s. It could also be seen in the same period in the quarrel between Harry Thuku's Young Kikuyu Association on the one hand, and the Kikuyu Association dominated by the traditional rulers on the other. 7\nYet one cannot conclude from the foregoing that in the period 1880 to 1935 the normal relationship between the new elites and the traditional rulers was invariably one of conflict. The nature of the relationship varied both in place and time. In the French territories neither the new elites nor the traditional rulers flourished under alien rule. And when after the Second World War the stranglehold of colonial autocracy came to be progressively relaxed, those who emerged as the leaders of French African nationalism included traditional rulers and their descendants."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': ""Maclean's career3 blossomed after the new retreat of the British govern¬ ment, which, caught up between its embarrassing allies on the coast and the fighting spirit of Asante, felt that the Gold Coast was too expensive in terms of money and human lives despite the British victory at Dodowa. Maclean, President of the Council of Merchants that provided the local administration of the forts, could therefore give free reign to his business acumen and knowledge of people, often disregarding official instructions from London, where a committee of merchants once again had charge of the forts. He had a twofold objective: to keep Asante at bay and to bring the coastal peoples under his control. He therefore had a tripartite FanteBritish-Asante treaty signed whereby the parties recognized the inde› pendence of the coastal countries south of the Pra river, agreed to bring any conflict before the British party and undertook to keep trade routes open. Maclean tried gradually to acquaint the Fante with English legal principles through a hierarchy of courts ranging from the chiefs' courts to those over which he himself presided. Local militias posted at the chiefs' courts helped to apply the new laws, whilst the introduction of cowries for minor transactions and the encouragement of the production of palm oil started to change the economic structure.\nHowever, the British government decided to resume direct control of the coastal settlements in 1843 and to govern them by a legal convention among the chiefs recognizing British law (the Bond of 1844).$^{4}$ In 1858 the administration of the Gold Coast, which, apart from the forts, was a protectorate rather than a colony, was separated from Sierra Leone.

Cutting across the lineage system of non-centralized societies, a variety of integrative institutions developed in the religious, judicial and economic fields which could function as an overall framework of order or replace a disintegrating state-system.$^{25}$ The poro and similar associations in Upper Guinea, or various so-called 'secret societies' in the Cross river and equatorial forest areas of the Cameroons and Gabon are examples.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The eastern regions of the Volta plateaux', 'content': 'The local power structure was also designed to provide a place for the older Fulbe clans which could not aspire to the office of amir: the jooro (village headmen) were selected from the ranks of the heads of families of more ancient lineage.

The countries on the sea-coast are divided into districts, to each of which a Commissioner is appointed by the Governor. The interior countries, however, are not thus provided for, but are left to be ruled by their chiefs and kings, as formerly. The authority of these kings and chiefs was not formally acknowledged, and any offence which, according to custom, is visited with severe punishment, is immediately reported to the Government authorities on the sea-coast; and the chieftain or king who ordered the punishment is brought before the Court and treated as the commonest fellow.\n\nThis action on the part of the Government terrifies and paralyzes a good many of these chiefs and kings, so that in a great many instances the wicked go unpunished. On the other hand, others use the name of the Government to acquire territories which they have not the least right to. Amongst these I may mention the name of one ""Sakiaty,"" who is of great notoriety in Eastern Croboe, interior of Accra. This man was a chief of Odumase, a country of Eastern Croboe, before the Ashanti Campaign, but immediately after the war, he assumed the authority and title of king, which he said was vested in him by Sir John Glover for the valuable services he rendered in the war. Not contented with the throne which he has thus usurped, he is now intriguing to acquire Western Croboe also. The present king of Western Croboe, who is now being molested, forbears to say anything, lest his opposition may end in a contest, and he may be thereby brought to the sea-coast and treated with ignominy. But there is sure to come a successor who will dispute every inch of ground that ""Sakiaty"" has thus acquired. This will undoubtedly end in strife, when people will have the mortification again to see that their royalties are treated contemptuously by those who are their protectors. If the present system of government in the interior countries is to continue, I would, Sir, respectfully recommend that the following plans be carried out: (1) that every chieftain or king in the interior should prove his claim; (2) that the right of government by native chiefs and kings in the interior, so far as it is compatible with common sense and humanity, be proclaimed as supported by the British authorities on the sea-coast; and (3), that any unnecessary interference and aggression of one chief or king with another, be met with the highest displeasure of the Governor.', 'last_edit_date': '1880-06-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_08_1880#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE CAPE COAST IMBROGLIO.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The chief Coast authority has at last appeared upon the scene. We were delighted when we heard he was to do so. Now, at least, we shall all understand what the Government really intends to do. King Aggery has been deposed, the native town courts have been abolished, there has been a real exercise of sovereignty over the town of Cape Coast, and the Governor-General will no doubt give us the key to all this; the natives will know whether they are regarded as British subjects or not; their future position and rights will be defined and explained, and the earnest solicitude of Her Majesty\'s Government for the welfare and progress of the people will most satisfactorily appear. The eventful day arrived. A general meeting was convened at Government-house on the 4th April. The authorities and people assembled. The Governor-General commenced by stating that ""there is to be a very great change in the Government at Cape Coast Castle."" We have given his Excellency\'s speech among our Cape Coast news; and we think our readers will agree with us that a more inconclusive and unsatisfactory address, regard being had to the peculiar state of affairs in the Protected Territories at the present time, never emanated from a superior authority. We shall not open up the whole question this month, because the Governor-General was to return to Cape Coast for a day or two, and it is possible that he may have then supplied the grave omissions in his former address. That address contains three salient points. First, the nomination of a head man by the Governor, instead of, as from time immemorial, the election of a King by the chiefs and people. Second, an assurance that they were under a mistake to think that the Government of those parts will ever be transferred to any native power. (We merely en passant beg to ask how far this agrees with the recommendation of the late Parliamentary Committee.) Third, that they should know what they were to expect in return for obedience to Her Majesty\'s laws. Now No. 1 was an accomplished fact; just or unjust, there it stood plainly and palpably before the assembly; for Quashie Attab, the head man so nominated, was there to be sworn in, and was sworn in to office before the assembly broke up. No. 2 was an authoritative declaration of very high importance no doubt, if the Governor-General was empowered to make it, and if it had been accompanied by those explanations which such an altered state of things absolutely required. But No. 3 was a promise which, if fulfilled, would have enabled every one to understand his true position vis-à-vis the British authorities, would have shown his duties and privileges, and cleared up all those doubts which, especially since 1865, have overshadowed the Gold Coast. But only in West African affairs could there have been so absurd a sequence as that to which Governor Blackall then treated the people. The great revelation of what they were to expect resolved itself into what was expected from them; for surely it did not need the presence of a supreme authority to tell them that they could appeal to him or Her Majesty\'s Government if they think fit; and yet this, and the assurance that in case of any opposition they would be prosecuted in the British courts of law, was all the revelation made to them of ""what they are to expect in return for obedience to Her Majesty\'s laws."" As we have before said, we refrain from comment until we know what supplementary revelations the Governor-in-Chief may have made during his second visit, of which we shall have news by the next mail; only remarking meanwhile that his communication to the people, so far as we yet know of it, must be considered by them about as satisfactory as was that of Rehoboam to the chiefs and people of Israel on his accession to the throne of his father Solomon. Governor Blackall will certainly never rank as the Solomon of the Coast; but he may be the Rehoboam if he proceeds in his present arbitrary and insulting policy, which seems to us to have no redeeming point as regards the people placed under his superintendence. ""I did not come to have a palaver; I came to lay down my law"" would be very fine, no doubt, from a great man and a conqueror, but is not what we expect from a Governor-General of the West Coast, as representing the Christian Government of Great Britain.', 'last_edit_date': '1867-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1867#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Popular Aspirations on the Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A small Parliamentary paper recently issued contains reports from the Governor of the Gold Coast Settlements to Lord Knutsford on a tour made by the former in the eastern districts of his government. In the various places to which he went Sir B. Griffith collected around him native chiefs and merchants, in order to hear from themselves their views and wishes. At Pram Pram, the King, an old man, wanted nothing save to be allowed to revive an old custom, part of which consisted in the exhumation of the dead. At Quetta the chiefs and people said they had nothing to say about the state of the district of his Excellency, but they did desire that the duty on spirits, which had been lowered experimentally from 2s. 6d. to 1s. a gallon, might be lowered still further to 6d. a gallon; they were glad that the *ad valorem* duties were abolished, and complained that traders were molested on one of the roads. The Governor told them he was determined to stop the smuggling of rum, and advised them to cultivate cotton. The desired remission in duty on spirits appears to have been refused. The Afflowho chiefs were also warned against smuggling, and told the great advantages of growing cotton. At Big Awoonah the chief sent a friendly message, which the Governor acknowledged with a present of half a sovereign and two bottles of champagne. At Addah there was an important meeting; the people there wanted a road to the beach, a school, stipends to the chiefs, the reduction of the duty on rum to 1s. a gallon, wells, a public bell to mark the time, a free ferry across the Volta River, and a warehouse on the beach. To these the Governor replied that he would help them to make the road, but they must help themselves; that he could not see why they wanted a school, seeing that they had already two, of which they did not avail themselves; he could not promise them stipends or reduce the rum duty; they would have their bell, and would be shown how to sink wells; the ferry would be considered, and they could not want a warehouse on the beach. Here, again, smuggling and cotton came up as before. On the following day the chiefs expressed a wish to have another interview with the Governor. They pressed him to reduce the rum duty, and to give them stipends; but after a lengthy discussion the Governor succeeded in sending them away in good humour; but without cheaper rum or the stipends. They did not press him a second time on the school question. At Odumassie the King received the Governor in great state, and, in return, the latter impressed upon his Majesty, his chiefs, and women the importance of cotton, and the advantages of the Basle missionaries. The King begged for a pair of handcuffs to enforce his powers, and a lamp; King Akrobato, whose capital is two hours’ journey from that of the King of Odumassie, also wanted a lamp and handcuffs. At Akropong the King and chiefs gave the Governor the most imposing reception he had had. ""I expatiated as usual upon cotton and cocoa cultivation."" The King said that the cocoa plants the Governor had sent him had all failed; he and his chiefs were anxious to know how they could recover debts due to them, and they also wanted to be paid in cash in place of gin for palm oil. On the whole the situation appears to be this—the Government want the people to grow cotton, cocoa, and coffee, so that they may not be wholly dependent on palm oil; to go to school, not to molest travellers, not to smuggle, and to keep the roads and wells in order.

In 1831, however, the exertions of the able, energetic, and resolute Mr. Maclean, then Governor of the Settlements, were rewarded with success. Convinced of the hopelessness of expecting that peace could be maintained so long as the Fantees and other tribes remained subject to the exactions and oppressions of their former rulers, and yet foreseeing at the same time the dangers which must result if so large a body of natives, composed of different tribes, and having different interests and views, were left to carry on their affairs without the control or guidance of any superior power, believing moreover that the influence of such a superior and civilised power would help to work valuable reforms among the most turbulent and lawless of them, he conceived the idea of compelling from the King of Ashantee an acknowledgment of their independence, and by the influence over them which our interference on their behalf had obtained for us, of inducing them to band themselves together under our guidance and control for protection against the common enemy. These important objects were at length secured by the signing of a treaty, on the 27th April, 1831, between the Governor, the Ashantees, and the Fantee and other tribes then in alliance with us, and during the next twelve years the results of this arrangement under the administration of Governor Maclean are detailed in the report of the committee of 1842, ""there was exercised a very wholesome influence over a coast not much less than 150 miles in extent, and to a considerable distance inland, preventing within that range external slave trade, maintaining peace and security, and exercising a useful, though irregular, jurisdiction among the neighbouring tribes, and much mitigating, and in some cases extinguishing some of the most atrocious practices which had prevailed among them unchecked before.""\n\nIn consequence of the recommendation of this committee, the direct management of the Gold Coast Settlements was in 1844 resumed by the Imperial Government, and at first placed under the jurisdiction of Sierra Leone; but in 1850 it was by letters patent created into a separate Government with executive and legislative councils for the administration of its affairs, an arrangement which continues at the present time.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1865#article-26', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE NEW GOVERNOR OF THE GOLD COAST AT LIVERPOOL.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In introducing Mr. Maxwell, the Chairman said Governor Maxwell had had a long and useful career, and was concerned in the affairs of this country in the East; and after good work at Penang and Singapore and other parts of the East, including Australia, he had been appointed Colonial Secretary of the Straits Settlements in 1892; and Deputy-Governor 1893-1894. The colony he was going to govern was the oldest British Colony on the West Coast of Africa, but it had not made that progress which it should have made considering the time they had had it. It was now about 300 years since the first occupation of the Gold Coast took place, but the Government had neglected the opportunities afforded for its advancement and development. However, largely on account of the action of the merchants in Liverpool and Manchester, and of England generally, a great deal more had been done in the last ten years to call attention to the importance of these colonies. They were now making better progress than ever before, and they relied upon his Excellency to see that this greater progress was continued. In the Colony he was going to administer there had been an excess of taxation over expenditure by some £200,000, which was lying in London unused. They urged that it was the duty of the Government to use it productively. Any excess in receipts should be used to make taxation more equal. He hoped that the new Governor would give his attention to this matter on his arrival on the coast. Another matter was the supply of water to the coast towns; and then there was the question of the railways. For years they had urged upon the Government the necessity for the construction of railways to the hinterland of the Gold Coast. They did not want to hurry the Government on this question, but if there was any progress to be made in this direction it was necessary something should be done to put them on an equality with other countries. It had been said that the first thing was to construct a harbour, for it would be impossible for the Government to land the material necessary for the construction of a railway unless there was a harbour where the goods could be landed. Latterly they had before them the proposed ordinance dealing with Crown concessions of land for mining or other purposes. He thought it was the first duty of the Government to see that such grants were utilised. The Section had sometimes complained or criticised some action, and he begged the Governor to believe any criticism of theirs upon any Governor or Government on the coast was done with the desire to co-operate with that Government or Governor to advance the welfare of the country in which they had all such interest. It was a great position his Excellency was going to fill. Governor Maxwell would have 2,000,000 human beings to care for, and he had the power to make or mar their happiness. It was a position of great responsibility, and it was one, in nine cases out of ten, filled with dignity and honour, and with a full regard for the welfare and the rights of the native population. At present Governor Maxwell was before them as an untried man as far as the West Coast was concerned, but his previous experiences would be of the greatest use to him amongst the natives of the West Coast. He might depend upon their support in everything calculated to advance the interests of the country which he was going to administer. He could only hope that Governor Maxwell would have good health to carry on the government successfully. They had every good wish for his future success.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-03-15', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1895#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Condition of the Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following letter appeared in a recent number of the *Globe*:\n\nSir,—As you have before now placed the Gold Coast Colony under obligation by bestowing some attention upon that God-forgotten place, I hope you will find room to publish the following extract from the *Western Echo*, published at Cape Coast, and dated November 18, 1885. It may be of interest to your readers as showing what things are frequently occurring in a British colony which extends nowhere more than 80 miles back from the sea, and which has a Governor with £3,500 a year, a secretary, and four assistant secretaries, to govern less than half a million people, living in a country of only 12,000 square miles:—\n\n""The Accrofuls and Puttooboos, who have always been creating disturbances in their district, had recently a quarrel, which terminated in a fight. On Monday morning, the 9th instant, the Puttooboos caught a native of Accroful, and this man, it is reported, they cruelly treated. They first took him and put him to death. This done, they surrounded the body with knives and cut it into small pieces, scattering the latter subsequently in various parts of their town, and taking the blood of the poor man and sprinkling it over their fetish. The Puttooboos, bent still on mischief, it is reported, then prepared their arms, and marched towards Accroful. Evidently the action of the Puttooboos was the outcome of certain ill-will which they bore towards the Accrofuls, and which, it is believed, was partially occasioned by the action of either the one or the other with respect to flags. Company fights are generally brought about by demonstrations with flags, and it is, perhaps, superfluous to add that those between villages or towns may often trace their origin to the very same source. The Accrofuls, it is stated, were suddenly surprised by the arrival in their village of an armed band of Puttooboos, who, on nearing the village, and seeing people, fired on them. From this account, it would appear that the Puttooboos were in Accroful before the Accrofuls could know that one of their natives had been killed and cut to pieces. The work of arming for a contest did not, however, occupy many minutes, and before the Puttooboos could believe it, their opponents were ready for them. Each party must then have retired to a spot close by, and there butchered one another. The fight commenced at 6 a.m., and lasted till 2 p.m., several being killed and wounded. Meanwhile news of the disturbance reached Cape Coast, and Captain Stewart, the District Commissioner, left with a party of armed police for the scene of hostilities. But the fighting was over. The combatants had scattered. Some Houssas, too, arrived on the scene from Elmina. The District Commissioner only succeeded in bringing to Cape Coast four natives of Puttooboo as prisoners.

The textbook details Theodore's proactive efforts to engage directly with European leaders, such as his letters to Queen Victoria and Emperor Napoleon III, where he proposed sending embassies and sought technical assistance. His frustration with Britain's lack of response and the perceived slight to his royal dignity further underscores his desire for equal recognition. Theodore's actions, including sending gifts and attempting to negotiate directly with European representatives, reflect his pursuit of direct communication and acknowledgment. However, the textbook also notes the challenges he faced, such as Britain's reluctance to engage and the shifting diplomatic landscape, complicating his efforts. The African Times articles support this claim by highlighting an instance where King Theodore, upon receiving a letter from the British Queen delivered by Mr. Bassam, remarked that ""Kings ought to write to kings, but no subordinates,"" emphasizing the importance of direct communication between monarchs. This statement aligns with his desire for equal recognition, though the articles lack further details on how this insistence impacted his broader diplomatic relations, a gap that historians might find significant.

Italy's claim was duly recognized by the European powers. Cartographers in Europe described the country on their maps as 'Italian Abyssinia', and when Menelik informed the powers of his coronation as emperor, scheduled for 3 November 1889, they replied, to his chagrin, that since Ethiopia was a protectorate they could not deal with him directly but only through Italy. Britain later entered into three protocols with Italy, on 24 March and 14 April 1891 and 5 May 1894, defining the frontiers between British colonial territory and the alleged protectorate. 51 The Italians in support of their claim meanwhile advanced from Eritrea into Tigre, in northern Ethiopia. Passing the limits earlier agreed to, they crossed the Mareb river and occupied the town of Adowa in January 1890. They then informed Ras Mangasha, the son of Yohannes and the ruler of Tigre province, that they would not withdraw until Menelik recognized their interpretation of the Wuchale treaty. 52 Menelik refused to accept this interpretation. On 27 September 1890, he wrote to King Umberto I of Italy pointing out that he had discovered that the two texts of Article XVII did not agree and declared: When I made that treaty of friendship with Italy, in order that our secrets be guarded and that our understanding should not be spoiled, I said that because of our friendship our affairs in Europe might be carried on with the aid of the Sovereign of Italy, but I have not made any treaty which obliges me to do so, and today, I am not the man to accept it. That one independent power does not seek the aid of another to carry on its affairs your Majesty understands very well. 53 Determined not to become further dependent on the Italian loan, he began paying it back. Relations between Italy and Ethiopia reached a deadlock. During the resultant discussions the Italian envoy, Antonelli, informed Menelik that, 'Italy cannot notify the other Powers that she was mistaken in Article XVII, because she must maintain her dignity'. Menelik's consort, Empress Taytu, replied, 'We also have made known to the Powers that the said Article, as it is written in our language, has another meaning.

The competition for power in Africa had been drawn into the international politics of the Concert of Europe where African diplomatic skills were at a grave disadvantage. It is doubtful whether African leaders realized until too late how great was the danger that threatened them. They were used to thinking that the European base was far away and that, in the final analysis, they had the advantage of numbers.\nThey continued to act as if they could play off one European power against another. In South Africa, they even believed that they could appeal to the Queen of England and her direct representatives to carry out treaty obligations against the wishes of Anglo-Boer settlers and fortune seekers. Far from any notion of forging a pan-African solidarity similar to that pursued by the Europeans, each African state acted as seemed best in its own individual interest.\nIt appears that, if any factor is to be singled out, the basic explanation for this was to be found not only in the diplomatic abilities of the European strategists, but also in the legacy of wars that was part of the revolutionary situation of nineteenth-century Africa.

But the new governors were overthrown and replaced by pre-existing dynasties during widespread revolts against his increasingly harsh rule. 20 The similarities between Liberia's and Ethiopia's political systems were too obvious from the analysis thus far to belabour. Besides possessing a core and periphery, and a central government, each had sub-political systems centred on local chiefdoms (or villages) like those of the Gola in Liberia or the Oromo ('Galla') in Ethiopia not discussed in this chapter, with political cultures more or less different from the dominant political culture at the centre. Both systems were solidly based on privilege at the core, and extensively utilized patronage and assimilation techniques. Nevertheless, whereas Ethiopia's imperial system was largely 'African', lacking political parties or parliament - Tewodros, Yohannes and Menelik became Emperor by virtue of their superior military power over their rivals, and not through the ballot box - Liberia's central government was thoroughly western.

Moreover, Madagascar was important for political and strategic considerations. In particular, the British wanted to secure the support of the ruler for the abolition of the slave trade, since Madagascar was one of the main sources of slaves in the region. It was Sir Robert's desire, therefore, to pursue an active political role in Madagascar. This policy, coinciding as it did with Radama's own determination to expand to the east, was to have, as one writer has put it, 'important consequences for the future of Madagascar'. 12 After several friendly contacts, Farquhar sent a diplomatic mission, led by Captain Le Sage, which arrived in Antananarivo on 21 December 1816. A treaty of friendship and commerce was eventually signed on 4 February 1817 between Radama and Le Sage. But this treaty did not satisfy the Mauritian Governor because it did not mention the slave trade, a matter of considerable importance to Sir Robert. The Governor therefore sent another mission to Radama's capital, this time led by James Hastie, a former Sergeant at Arms in India and more experienced in handling negotiations with oriental rulers.$^{13}$ Hastie brought along with him a number of gifts for the king, including horses, a compass, a map of the world and a chiming clock, all of which greatly impressed the young king and helped Hastie to win his love and confidence. The negotiations, however, stumbled over the British insistence that Radama should outlaw the slave trade in Madagascar. When Radama argued that by doing this he would be com› mitting economic suicide because the slave trade was the major source of his revenue, Hastie had a ready answer: the British would pay the Malagasy ruler an annual sum of 1000 dollars in gold, 1000 dollars in silver, a hundred barrels of gunpowder, 100 English muskets with 100 flints, 400 soldiers' uniforms, 12 sergeants' swords, 600 pieces of cloth, a full-dress uniform for himself and 2 horses as compensation.$^{14}$ Radama considered that he had made a fair deal, especially since the treaty also recognized him as king of the whole of Madagascar.

On one occasion a group of robbers came to him armed to the teeth, asking him to confirm their right to exercise the occupation of their fathers.

He ordered the Muslims in his dominions, Plowden notes, 'to become Christian within the year', and expelled all Roman Catholics.72 He was later quoted as declaring that if he did not 'make Gallas and Amharas eat together at the same table' he should no longer be called a Christian.73 In order to consolidate his control of Tigré, his first wife having died, he married Terunash, or Teruwarq, daughter of his old enemy, Dajazmach Webé.74\nThe reforming monarch also turned his attention to the Church, whose head, Abuna Salama, he had imprisoned as early as 1857. Téwodros sought to reduce the number of clergy, to curtail ecclesiastical land, and to make the priests dependent on state salaries.75 These measures were strenuously opposed by the clergy.76 In the long run, hostility from the priests, coupled with that of the provincial nobles, turned much of the population against him.

Our object is to carry out faithfully the treaties which our Government has made with her and with other Powers. But there is one thing which astonishes us not a little. We are a people who pay great respect to foreigners. Every stranger who visits our island is a witness to that—(hear, hear)—and we know not how it is that by some the respect which is due to us in return is transferred to the still barbarian Sakalava, who have refused the humanising influence of Europe altogether. It is our fervent desire, Sir, that your good wishes may be realized in the unbroken independence of Madagascar. (Cheers.) And lastly, we thank you most sincerely for the healths you have just drunk. We assure you that the courtesy and friendliness which we have received in this great City of London will never be forgotten by us. They will be, in the language of our Malagasy proverb, like kine that are born in summer pasturages, at once both a pleasure and a profit; and the kindness you have shown us this day will be as the beef hump which used to be the meat of the bold warrior.

King Ja Ja, so far from attempting to monopolize the trade, has been fighting the battle of the native traders, his subjects. It is all a question of getting rid of the middleman. When trade is depressed the buyer wishes to deal directly with the seller, without the intervention of a broker. King Ja Ja and his merchants are the brokers between the producers of palm oil in the interior and the merchants who export the oil from the coast. The European traders wish to trade direct, just as we natives would like to trade direct with the manufacturers in this country. But we are not allowed; for we are compelled to submit to the brokerage charges of English middlemen. The European merchants on the coast consented to pay brokerage or commission to King Ja Ja for all oil which they bought from him, but they refused to pay commission to the native merchants, who were doing business side by side with the King. Ja Ja refused to separate his interests from those of his subjects, and insisted upon the maintenance of the treaty. It is to punish this that he has been first fined and then deposed.\'\n\n""Editor: \'Have any steps been taken to bring this matter before the Government?\'\n\n""Deputation: \'Yes; King Ja Ja sent his son and three of his chiefs to England to represent the matter before the Foreign Secretary; but they could get no answer except that Admiral Grubb would investigate the matter. When they were absent from Opobo, the traders sent for Consul Johnston, who invited King Ja Ja to a friendly meeting at Harrison\'s Beach. When King Ja Ja, relying upon the good faith of the Consul, came to the meeting, he was arrested and carried away to the Gold Coast, where he still remains, surrounded by people who cannot speak his own language, and unable to communicate his grievances to those who are sitting in judgment upon him. Consul Johnston has trampled under foot the rights of treaties, and even the ordinary usages of savage nations, in his arrest of a protected King, who accepted his apparently friendly invitation only to find himself made a prisoner and carried away from his own country. This is not honest, neither is it honest the way in which Consul Johnston goes on suppressing my trade, for instance (said one member of the deputation), and saying that he does so because of orders from home. When I came here to ask why the orders have been issued, they tell me there are no orders; Consul Johnston has never been instructed to suppress my trade. Why treat us in this way? Is this just? Is this true? Why do you make us feel that you have no respect for treaty or the rights of any persons but yourselves? You would not let us trade without middlemen. Why should you depose our King because he protects the rights of his subjects who are middlemen?

After hearing both sides, and, I am bound to add, a good many irrelevant and insulting remarks from the traders in respect to the King, Mr. Consul Hewett decided that by the Treaty of Berlin the traders had a perfect right to proceed to the markets in the interior, and that they were to be permitted to do so in the future without molestation. Ja Ja thereupon announced his intention to appeal to the Home Government against this decision, which he declared would ruin him, and that had he known it was ever likely to be brought about he would never have signed the treaty placing his territory under the protection of Great Britain. It appears to me that the King is emphatically in the right, and that after negotiating a treaty with him by which he refused to allow Europeans access to the interior of his country, the British Government by its representative has no right to utilize the Treaty of Berlin as an excuse for upholding the action of certain filibustering traders.

In due time this invitation to Berlin was issued, and accepted by all the European Powers who were signatories to the Treaty of Paris. The Council was summoned to meet on the 13th June, and on that day it duly assembled at the Old Radziwill Palace, in Berlin, which has been recently restored and fitted as a residence for Prince Bismarck. To the great astonishment of the majority of the British people, it was first rumoured, and subsequently officially announced, that the British Plenipotentiaries were to be the Premier, the Earl of Beaconsfield, and the Marquis of Salisbury, Her Majesty\'s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to be assisted by Lord Odo Russell, the British Ambassador at the German Court. The unadvisability of the simultaneous absence from London of the Premier and the Foreign Secretary, and that during the sitting of Parliament, was justly and freely animadverted upon even by some of the deeply pledged adherents of the Ministry on the Eastern Question; while, on the other hand, it was almost asserted that so much of a mutual understanding between the divers European Courts had been arrived at, that the entire work of the Council would probably be concluded in three or four sittings, and Great Britain have back her Premier, chaplet on brow, to be displaced only by a ducal coronet that should adorn his distinguished head, and realize, we may suppose, the loftiest height of his ambitious dreams. The Plenipotentiaries meet, as proposed, on the 13th June. On the 14th, the Globe, an evening paper, came out in London with certain columns headed ""Full Text of the Anglo-Russian Agreement,"" the details of which in English and in the original French, and signed ""Schouvaloff"" and ""Salisbury,"" it prefaced with the following words: ""The Berlin Congress having assembled, there is no longer any reason for our withholding the full text of the agreement between the Governments of England and Russia, signed at the Foreign Office on the 30th May,"" &c., &c.

People feel jealous of being advised by foreigners; they feel that there is an assumption of superiority of wisdom and virtue; and selfish motives are attributed to the advisers. Now, I venture to think that this objection does not apply in the slightest degree to the meeting to-day. Some eighteen months ago her Majesty\'s Government made a proposal, not that we should go and teach other countries what was to be done about the slave trade, but assuming that all European nations are now inclined to carry out principles which have been proclaimed both by treaty and international communications for some seventy-five years. As against the slave trade, the Government felt that the moment had come when other countries desired to give practical effect to that policy. Lord Salisbury selected perhaps the individual who was best qualified for the duty to preside over the Conference of European Powers. I therefore accepted the invitation to come here with very great pleasure. I received a little shock when I saw in the newspapers that objections were made to our meeting by a society for which I have the very greatest possible respect—that important historical society, the Anti-Slavery Society. It is now more than fifty years ago, very soon after the Aborigines\' Protection Society was established, that I entered office under Lord Palmerston. The strongest political feeling Lord Palmerston had was his horror of the slave trade, and his determination to put it down, and no one who was not in the Foreign Office at the time with him could hardly be aware of the immense amount of energy and labour he devoted to the attainment of that object. Under these circumstances I was naturally in communication with the Anti-Slavery Society—and I have at times been in communication with it ever since. I say that any objection from the Anti-Slavery Society, or any communication from it, would come with great authority. I own that if the objection taken had been that our objects were unworthy, I should have been very much shaken. But it is not so; they agree with us entirely in thinking that this question of the supply of arms to the slave-traders and the question of the supply of alcohol to a great multitude of the African population is one of the most serious and dangerous importance. Their objection rests on a question of tactics. They think that there are two questions already brought before the Conference of vital importance, and that they might be endangered by any other question being raised there at all. But on this question I am not sure that the Anti-Slavery Society speak with greater authority than any other body of men. What is our position here? You have heard the first resolution. Other resolutions to be proposed will set out the prominent causes of the mischief, and the final resolution will be ""That copies of the foregoing resolutions be forwarded to his Majesty the King of the Belgians, the president of the International Conference, her Majesty\'s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and her Majesty\'s Minister at the Belgian Court."" There is nothing compulsory in that, and if Lord Salisbury and the King of the Belgians and Lord Vivian are of opinion that no new subject should be brought before the Conference, supposing they think it better to keep these resolutions a little in the background, in what way can our recommendations of today interfere with such a decision? If, they think that these subjects are so closely interweaved that they would not interfere with the general consent of the European Powers. I venture to think that it would strengthen the hands of Lord Salisbury and Lord Vivian, that a meeting under the presidency of the Lord Mayor had passed these resolutions. I said that it was a wise step to ask the King of the Belgians to take the initiative in this matter of the Conference. I think that it is impossible not to recognise why he has the greatest claims and qualifications for the task. In recent years we have seen men of great wealth making magnificent contributions to objects of philanthropy. The King of the Belgians has this pleasant characteristic, but none of the contributions approached in wideness of scope those of the King of the Belgians. We see what he has done, for instance, by the creation of the Congo State. He has not only given time and most anxious care to the affairs of the State—his contributions in a pecuniary sense are perfectly enormous. The official returns show the cost to be about £70,000 a year, and the whole comes from the King of the Belgians, not as Sovereign, but as a private individual from his private means. I have reason to believe that hundreds of thousands beyond that have been spent by him in this great work, and I think it is satisfactory that the King of the Belgians accepted the presidency of the Conference, the object of which is to give practical effect to principles which have really been sanctioned by the whole of Europe for some seventy-five years. I think it is becoming that this meeting we should commence operations by giving a vote of thanks to the King of the Belgians for the part he has taken in this important affair.

1502,"Women significantly influenced societal development in 19th-century Africa by actively participating in philanthropic activities, challenging traditional gender roles.","The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that women significantly influenced societal development in 19th-century Africa through philanthropic activities and by challenging traditional gender roles. The General History of Africa textbook refutes this claim, highlighting the deterioration of women's status during the colonial period. It notes that women were largely excluded from activities introduced or intensified by colonialism, such as Western education and various professions, and were not given a place in the new colonial political setup. Even in matrilineal societies, there was a shift towards patrilineal systems, emphasizing the marginalization of women rather than their active involvement in societal development. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing the efforts of women like Mrs. Joseph Moseley, who established a female school at Cape Coast to elevate the moral and social status of African women through education. The articles also mention other women, such as Mrs. Ingham, who trained African women as nurses, and the Methodist Christian Women’s Association, which engaged in fundraising and organizing bazaars.

However, the articles do not explicitly discuss the broader societal impact of these efforts or their perception in the context of 19th-century African society, leaving an area of interest for historians studying women's influence during this period.","The General History of Africa textbook does not provide evidence to support the claim that women significantly influenced societal development in 19th-century Africa by actively participating in philanthropic activities and challenging traditional gender roles. Instead, the text highlights the deterioration of women's status during the colonial period, noting that women were largely excluded from activities introduced or intensified by colonialism, such as Western education and various professions. The text also mentions that women were not given a place in the new colonial political setup, and even in matrilineal societies, there was a shift towards patrilineal systems. This exclusion from societal development activities contrasts with the claim of women's significant influence through active participation. Therefore, the textbook presents a narrative that refutes the claim, emphasizing the marginalization of women rather than their active involvement in societal development during the 19th century.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that women significantly influenced societal development in 19th-century Africa by actively participating in philanthropic activities and challenging traditional gender roles. The articles highlight the efforts of Mrs. Joseph Moseley, who dedicated her life to establishing a female school at Cape Coast, aiming to elevate the moral and social status of African women through education. Her work is portrayed as a self-sacrificing mission driven by Christian duty, which involved severing ties with her native land to benefit the female population of Cape Coast. The articles also mention the involvement of other women, such as Mrs. Ingham, who worked on training African women as nurses, and the Methodist Christian Women’s Association, which actively participated in fundraising and organizing bazaars. These activities demonstrate women's active roles in philanthropy and their efforts to improve the social conditions of African women, thereby challenging traditional gender roles.

But the march of events is developing the interesting fact that there is a career before this people which no other people can enter upon. There is a peculiar work for them to accomplish, both in the land of their bondage, and in the land of their fathers, which no other people can achieve. With the present prospects and privileges before his race - with the chances of arduous work, noble suffering, and magnificent achievement before them - I would rather be a member of this race than a Greek in the time of Alexander, a Roman in the Augustin period, or an AngloSaxon in the nineteenth century. 46 It was also Blyden who in his famous speech to the American Col› onization Society in May 1880 gave great publicity to the phrase 'Ethiopia Stretching Out her Hands Unto God' and equated Ethiopian with African; and it was he who first used the term 'African personality' in his lecture delivered on 19 May 1893 in Freetown when he described the African Race as 'a Great Race - great in its vitality, in its power of endurance and its prospect of perpetuity'. He continued: It is sad to think that there are some Africans, especially among those who have enjoyed the advantages of foreign training, who are so blind to the radical facts of humanity as to say, 'Let us do away with the sentiment of Race. Let us do away with our African personality and be if possible in another Race ...

First was the rise of Ethiopianism, an African religious and political nationalist movement. This, secondly, embodied an intellectual revolution, especially in South and West Africa. It should be emphasized that until as late as the 1850s those educated Africans who entered the professions were treated as equals by the whites and were given appointments commensurate with their educational qualifications and experience. Many of the African educated elite sincerely believed that Africa could only be civilized by the application of European learning, technology and religion. But the decades after the 1850s saw 'the emergence of pseudo-scientific thought in Europe and America which interpreted society in terms of fixed racial categories in which the Negro was assigned a very lowly place'.$^{35}$ These racist ideas were given very wide publicity during the second half of the century by the writings of people like Arthur de Gobineau, Sir Richard Burton and Winwood Reade. These ideas came to be accepted by the generality of European missionaries and administrators in Africa, who began to discriminate against the educated Africans in favour of whites, both in Church and government. It was principally this racial discrimination practised against the educated Africans by the white missionaries and the consequent sense of humiliation and indignation that gave rise to the religious and political nationalist movement that became known as Ethiopianism, a term coined from the Biblical verse, 'Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God'.$^{36}$ Following similar movements of independency shown by Nova Scotians in Sierra Leone at the beginning of the century, this movement aimed at establishing Christian churches under the control of Africans themselves and in tune with African cultures and traditions. It began in South Africa probably early in the 1860s. It reached its maturity in the 1880s with the formation of the first break-away Ethiopian or African independent Church in South Africa in 1884 by the Tembu Wesleyan minister, Nehemiah Tile, and in West Africa by a group of Nigerian church leaders of the Southern Baptist Mission (American) in 1888.$^{37}$ It is significant that while Tile expressed his wish 'to adapt the message of the Church to the Heritage of the Tembu' he also added that 'as the Queen of England was the Head of the English Church, so the Paramount Chief of the Tembu should be the summus episcopus of the new religious organization'.$^{38}$ T."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.605, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Ethiopianism', 'content': ""Heritage of the Tembu' he also added that 'as the Queen of England was the Head of the English Church, so the Paramount Chief of the Tembu should be the summus episcopus of the new religious organization'.$^{38}$ T.

Three typical examples were James Africanus Horton who was born in 1835 in Sierra Leone, trained in Britain as a doctor from 1853 to 1859 and entered the West African Medical Service as a Staff Assistant Surgeon; Samuel Ajayi Crowther who was one of the first products of Fourah Bay College and the first African to be ordained as a Bishop of the Anglican Church; and James Johnson, that fiery intellectual and evangel¬ ist.28 Others included Broughton Davies, who qualified as a doctor in 1859, and Samuel Lewis, the lawyer, the first African to receive a knighthood.29 Liberia also produced a few intellectuals, among whom was Edward Wilmot Blyden, who was born in the West Indies.

More than that, there was a growing demand for labour outside the customary bounds of the household unit, the village community or age grade associations. While the various societies remained resistant to freemen selling their labour, the predominant tendency in the nineteenth century was towards expansion of the scale of slave labour, an increase in the areas in which enforced labour was used, and a greater use of migrant labour. The general trend in the third quarter of the nineteenth century was for increased slaveholding in general, even in rural areas, an increase in the number of slaves held within each household, and an increase in the use of slaves in production under quasi-capitalist conditions, thus making their lives harsher than ever before. 18 With the intensification of political rivalries from the very beginning of the century, it became usual to press disputes over land, cattle, and even doctrinal differences to the point of completely destroying the enemy as an identifiable entity.

Such captives were used to satisfy the increasing demand for labour in agriculture, craft production and mining and also as warriors in the emerging professional armies.

These new aristocracies depended not on large kinship groups as such, but on large households of clients and captives who maintained increasingly large farms to provision the household as well as groups of warriors at the battlefront.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools.

Thus, once the Yao were defeated, they helped to conquer the Mpeseni Nguni who, in turn, were used by the Portuguese to defeat the Barue. , ·;/-.,-, Without African allies and mercenaries, it would not have been possible for the Europeans to impose their rule at such a minimal cost in man› power. More than 90% of.the Portuguese armies which finally \'conquered\' the Zambezi valley in 1902, for example, were African levies.$^{30}$ Although not as extreme, a similar pattern existed in Angola. To the north, the Congo Free State army consisted of African levies with some Zanzibari and Hausa mercenaries. Only, the officers were Europeans.

We write in a foreign country, without knowing whether our appeal of last month has produced any pecuniary results, or any offers of assistance as regards the bazaar, for which, as we then stated, one hundred pounds' worth of articles had been offered from one quarter, provided more could be obtained. An effort must be made for the moral and industrial elevation of the Cape Coast female population. No aid can be expected from the Government in the first instance; but we can have no doubt that if once the school was established some means for supporting it would be found. The great difficulty is in commencing a work of this kind in a country so far away and so little thought of now in England as the Cape Coast territories. Kindness to the African female population always meets with its reward. Several instances have come to light of lives saved in Jamaica through the grateful affection and sympathy of women. Persons whose lives would otherwise have been sacrificed were warned, secreted, and assisted to escape by tender-hearted black women. We never regretted more, perhaps never so much, as at this moment that our appeals for assistance, which we are very chary about making, have been, for the most part, so feebly responded to. We fear the fault must lie greatly at our own door, and that we do not possess the gift of begging. We shall be glad indeed to find that in this instance we have been more successful, because it is not we who beg, so much as it is a noble Christian lady who begs through us, and who offers to risk life, health, all the charms of civilised society and friendly associations, to labour in the cause of God and of the most pitiably ignorant of her sex in a land which possesses no attractions for her save those great ones of a supposed Christian duty to be performed—a work to be done by her—marked out and set apart for her by God, who has placed in her heart so deep an interest in the temporal and eternal welfare of those poor helpless creatures, who have entreated and implored of her to return and resume and continue her labours of Christian love among them.\n**77**""}, {'id': 819, 'article_title': 'Donations for Cape Coast Castle Native Female Industrial School', 'full_section_title': 'Donations for Cape Coast Castle Native Female Industrial School', 'last_edit_date': '05-23-1866', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1866#article-6', 'issue_date': '23_05_1866', 'content': ""Subscriptions already published . . . £203 13 6  \nMrs. Malcolm, Glenomag . . . 5 0 0  \nW.

The devoted lady on her arrival here was received at Government House by his Excellency, Sir Arthur E.

It is not likely that there can be any adequate idea among our friends on the West Coast, of the heavy personal sacrifices which such a step on the part of such a lady involves; where cherished family ties must be torn asunder, and so many dear Christian friends be left. We hope, however, they will believe us when we tell them that the sacrifice is a heavy one, and such a one as only an extreme Christian love for the souls of the rising female population of Cape Coast could induce. There are many—alas! too many—fields of Christian labour in England, requiring talents such as those with which Mrs. Mosely is so richly endowed; fields in which great good might be done, and labour in which would not involve any of those painful sacrifices to which we have referred; but all these are passed by because of a great love for the African people, and the conviction that among them is the field of labour to which God has especially called her by the mysterious workings of his providence. We hope that all this will be borne in mind by our readers at Cape Coast; that they will impress this upon those around them, and that there will at least be a hearty endeavour on their part to help by any means in their power, in the work to which this lady has thus devoted herself for the good of that race and that community of which they form a part.

All efforts for changing the condition of the African people must be fruitless where this great element of civilization—an educated female community—is wanting. In another column will be found an appeal by Mrs. Moseley for funds necessary to establish a school for females at Cape Coast. Mrs. Moseley is the widow of a gentleman who, for some short time, until death removed him at once from life and duty, occupied a high official position at Cape Coast. While there with her late husband, Mrs. Moseley obtained the confidence and affection of almost the whole female population of the town. Since her return to this country her efforts have been unceasing to procure some arrangements by which the females of the town of Cape Coast may become so raised in social condition as to insure not only an increase of personal happiness among them, but, through their social influence, a general advancement in Christian civilization. To this great and most interesting work Mrs. Moseley has dedicated her future life. Already beloved by the female population at Cape Coast, she would commence her noble labours with advantages that many ladies might fail to secure, even were other ladies disposed thus to exile themselves from that civilization which must be so dear, in order to labour in such a country as that of Guinea in the cause of humanity and of Him who gave himself a sacrifice for mankind. Many of our efforts on behalf of Africa are possibly misunderstood. About this work of Mrs. Moseley's there cannot, however, be any misapprehension. Every lady who reads our journal ought to interest herself in this movement. It ought, and must, we should think, appeal forcibly to every female heart. Let it be remembered that the uneducated female in that part of the country is little better than a beast of burthen.* We have always insisted upon the absolute necessity of efforts to elevate that portion of the community, if any real good is to be effected in Africa. And we now most earnestly appeal to all our readers for their individual aid and their personal efforts on behalf of that work for the prosecution of which Mrs. Moseley offers—yes, we need not have any hesitation in saying it, for we believe that she has fully counted the cost—offers her life.\n\nWe shall rejoice indeed to see the names of the ladies in all our subscribers' families on Mrs. Moseley's list; and if it be preferred to forward subscriptions through us, we shall be glad to have the pleasure of handing them to Mrs. Moseley's treasurers.\n\nCAPE COAST CASTLE NATIVE FEMALE SCHOOL, GOLD COAST, WEST AFRICA."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1864#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.604, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""MRS. MOSELEY'S CAPE COAST FEMALE SCHOOL"", 'section_title': '', 'content': '*Che dura vince!* We write with our heart full of gratitude and praise to God that the long continued and increasing efforts for obtaining the preliminary arrangements which we considered indispensable to the permanent success of Mrs. Moseley\'s projected self-devoting effort at Cape Coast, have at length been crowned with success. Our deeply interested friends at Cape Coast were informed of this by the mail of the 24th October, although the certainty (D.V.) was arrived at too late to allow of our announcing it in our last month\'s issue. Yet a few days or weeks, and one of the African steamers will be bearing to the West Coast a rich tribute of Christian zeal and womanly sympathy in the person of one who relinquishes all the endearments of family and friends, all the refinements of advanced civilisation, because her heart is overflowing with love and pity for a female population growing up in an ignorance that leads to and perpetuates the deepest social debasement, and burns with a holy desire for their Christian and industrial regeneration. It has been a deep disgrace to Great Britain that her PROTECTORATE of Cape Coast has not hitherto been attended by any Government effort to remove that almost impassable barrier against Christian civilisation that is raised by the continuance of the female population in that debased and degraded state to which they have been consigned from generation to generation. Thank God that disgrace is now about to be removed! He has raised up an instrument admirably fitted for the work; her earnestness has prevailed over official inertion and incredulity; and we have now the full conviction that her noble effort will receive that official protection and aid which, as before stated, we have considered to be indispensable to the permanent establishment in Cape Coast of a Christian industrial female school, wherein the present and future rising generations of African females may be brought under the civilising influences of instruction imparted by zealous and devoted Christian Englishwomen, of whom Mrs. Moseley looks upon herself as the first in time only. For although it may—as we pray and hope that it will—please God greatly to bless and prosper her individual exertions in this great and interesting field of labour, it is of course only a foundation that she will be able to lay. The leaven that is to leaven the whole lump of female degradation within the Cape Coast territories will need to be continually replenished; and the work will be begun in faith that He who has filled the one heart with ardent desire thus to labour in that portion of his vineyard, will fill other hearts from time to time with desire to go and do likewise; even as he has moved that of the present distinguished head of the British Executive on the West Coast, Sir A. E. Kennedy, to a full comprehension of the inestimable value of the effort about to be made by Mrs. Moseley, and to a determination to do all that is in his power, both as Governor-in-Chief and as a Christian gentleman, to protect and further the noble work. We should fail in our duty if we did not here tender to his Excellency our most sincere and warmest thanks; and express our joy that the name of one who has already conferred so many benefits on Africa by his enlightened rule (because he feels what the duty of Great Britain really is on the West Coast) will be written indelibly in African annals as associated with this work and labour of love for the African people. Now that the work is, by God\'s blessing, about to commence, we think it incumbent on us to point out how great an advantage it will offer to many educated African parents in other towns of Cape Coast and the Gold Coast; and, the distance not being great, even in Lagos, so soon as adequate accommodation can be provided for them, Mrs. Moseley will, we believe, consent to receive the daughters of such Africans as can afford to pay for their instruction, although they may not be residents in Cape Coast. A growing want of such a place of education in that part of Africa has long been felt; hitherto such Africans in those parts have had no possibility of obtaining a refined Christian education for their daughters without sending them to England; a course which was attended with great risk, and entails a very heavy expense. In consenting to take upon herself this heavy additional labour, we think we are correct in saying that Mrs. Moseley hopes thereby to raise up a class of African lady teachers, who will be competent to instruct others of their race in those Christian principles, industrial pursuits, and social refinements which must be imparted in the first instance by one so admirably fitted to impart them as Mrs. Moseley undoubtedly is. And we cannot avoid expressing the hope and the conviction that the presence of this lady at Cape Coast will be productive of great good in other ways. It seems to us a matter of much importance that such a nucleus of polished female Christian society should exist, where young African ladies who return from being educated in England may find a congenial society, be surrounded by pure and holy, as well as refined associations and influences, and have a kind and sympathising friend and counsellor, ever ready to aid them in preserving the advantages they have obtained by education in England, and in setting before their African sisters who have not been so favoured an example of Christian purity and Christian love. And in proportion as the number of educated Christian women thus increases, it may be hoped that Christian English officials, having thus a society at command in which their wives would find themselves at home, might be induced to bring them out to add to the charms of that society, and to help in the great work of African social regeneration. The moral atmosphere of the place would thus become, in some degree at least, purified; and we might hope to see a more abundant fruit of the labours of those Christian missionaries who have been endeavouring to inculcate Gospel truths and Gospel principles. It is in the belief that such results may flow from the foundation of Mrs. Moseley\'s Female School, that we have given to her noble and self-devoted efforts all the support in our power, and persevered through evil as well as through good report, until now at last her preliminary efforts have been crowned with success, and the scene of her labours is about to be changed from England to Cape Coast.

We have numbers of women in good position in this colony, but they have as yet found no useful and satisfactory channel for their energies. We have, in the midst of us here, at the same time, gross ignorance and superstition as to the causes and treatment of sicknesses, and it is a common saying on this coast that more people die from want of nursing than from any other cause. Few people in England realise the isolation of Europeans when in fever, and the difficulties attending medical treatment in this climate, where European nurses cannot keep their health. Our scheme will, we hope, alleviate much suffering and save valuable lives.\n\nIt is a modest one. A site is given facing the sea, and the building is to cost about £500. We propose to begin with twelve beds. Two English ladies, it is hoped, will come out to begin the work and to train the African women.\n\nHer Royal Highness the Princess Christian has graciously given the scheme her warm approval.

One cannot be always rolling a stone uphill. If we are to judge by results, we should say it has become a fixed idea in all but a few superior minds that to give for African objects is to throw money away. The old Christian sympathies for Africa seem to have made an Arctic voyage and become thoroughly iced. They will thaw some day—of that we have no doubt—and for the most part we endeavor to wait with as good a grace as possible. But there are some things to be done that strike so immediately and directly at the worst of the evils of African society, that to withhold the pecuniary means, when the more precious ones of devoted Christian zeal and self-sacrificing human sympathy are ready for action, is a deplorable neglect of duty. To hope against constant disappointment is difficult, but in one case, at least, we do try to hope that such neglect of duty will not appear. The Cape Coast Female School, for which Mrs. Moseley, widow of a late chief justice of the Supreme Court at the Gold Coast, is seeking the necessary funds, ought to be commenced forthwith. There is no real Christian civilization possible anywhere without a previous release of the female part of the population from those degradations to which they are subject in heathen and barbarous countries. A real civilization must begin with the education and refinement of woman. When at Cape Coast, Mrs. Moseley, whose Christian heart was deeply grieved at the debased condition of the women and the utter neglect of the female children, made some efforts at imparting instruction, which were most gratefully welcomed by the people, and promised to be attended with very beneficial results. The poor creatures saw that a kind and generous heart was interested in their welfare, and they repaid her efforts with a warm and most gratifying tribute of affection. It is impossible to estimate the good that might be effected by the devoted labors of a refined and cultivated Christian lady such as Mrs. Moseley really is. We are sure that, if our readers could see her and hear her plead for the poor people for whose welfare she is ready to give up all the charms of a refined society she is so eminently fitted to adorn, they would feel so powerfully the influence of that sense of Christian duty by which she is actuated to make such sacrifices, that they would soon double the amount now stated to be indispensable to the commencement of the work at Cape Coast. We refer our readers, our lady readers especially, to Mrs. Moseley\'s letter which appears in our third page. They will perceive that some 300l. and more is still wanting, and that 100l. worth of articles for a fancy fair has been promised. We do not take the liberty of attempting to dictate to our readers how this 300l. is to be made up, whether by direct money, subscriptions, or by bazaar efforts—all we say is, make it up some way or other.

It is not, as some have stated (unjustly and unkindly), the want of intellect or the repugnance evinced by the natives to receive assistance and information from those who have so long laboured amongst them, but from the deep-rooted superstition which prevails, inherited from their forefathers, which cannot be at once eradicated from their minds.\n\n""The natives generally are particularly intelligent, very grateful, and anxious to gain information, not addicted to the violent passions and cruelties practised by other unchristian nations. Why, then, should not the great cause of Christian civilization progress in West Africa as in other settlements?\n\n""It is, in my opinion, because the female part of the community are kept in such a degraded state. They are uneducated, and looked upon by the other sex as mere slaves, and treated as such. Their lives are devoted to manual labour, and their persons frequently sold or pawned to supply the pecuniary wants of their owners, instead of being respected and looked up to as equals, and helpmates in Christian and domestic happiness. Until the female population is raised to its proper position, Christian civilization can never arrive at that standard which we are all anxious to witness, and which it is our duty, as followers of Christ, to endeavour to reach.\n\n""Mrs. Moseley, the widow of the much-beloved and respected judge who was stationed at Cape Coast, and greatly esteemed and regretted by all, and especially by the native population, has, I am happy to find, come forward and offered her services in establishing an infant female school at Cape Coast.\n\n""With God\'s assistance, and a person so well qualified as Mrs. Moseley, we may look forward to great results.

The news of this commencement of hostilities was announced on the 28th, and followed by ten days\' festivities and fetish observances. At daybreak each morning the women paraded the town for a couple of hours, with three streaks of white paint down their foreheads, and howled for their husbands. The shout was anything but musical. They then retired for a few hours, and came out in full numbers about ten a.m. Then indeed was there a sight worth seeing. Each absent warrior had a representative in the person of his wife, or of a female slave dressed in male attire. The canoe-man\'s wife came out with a paddle; the bushman\'s with a long knife, the carpenter\'s with a saw, and the chieftain\'s with a birch broom to denote authority. A dreadful-looking woman, with a paper cocked hat on her head, and a cat-o\'-nine tails in her hand, was pointed out to me as \'Captain Glover;\' another, slightly less dreadful, as \'Mr. Goldsworthy.\' Lieutenants Larcom and Moor, Captain Sartorius and Mr. Blissett, appeared amongst the number. It was informed by Mrs. Addo, the hotel-keeper, that her slaves were dressed to dance for the officers of the expedition, as it was unlucky not to have some person specially appointed to appeal to the fetish for you. The enormous array danced for hours through the town, shouting songs of war and prayers for the defeat of the Acoosas and all their other enemies, going through the motions of trampling down the foe and cutting their throats, and finally supplicating the fetish for the return of their husbands and masters. So excited were they, that the perspiration poured off them; but they never once ceased dancing and shouting; their enthusiasm lending a wild melody to their notes of war or prayer. They kept excellent time withal with the war drums beaten by old women and young girls. Some of the cries they uttered are not within the compass of a white man\'s voice, and bore more resemblance to those of wild beasts. Woe betide the unfortunate man found lurking in the town when this procession comes round; his shoulders would soon feel the weight of the cat, and the paddles, and other weapons. The women drive every man to the war, and are more effectual than any police in clearing the town of any loafers.

1590,The redistribution of wealth and strategic promotions within the military served to consolidate power and incentivize loyalty and performance among officers in the colonial context.,"The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide a nuanced perspective on the claim that the redistribution of wealth and strategic promotions within the military served to consolidate power and incentivize loyalty and performance among officers in the colonial context. The General History of Africa highlights how rulers in states like Asante, Dahomey, and Buganda centralized power by creating a hierarchy of officials reliant on the ruler for their positions, reflecting strategic promotions similar to those in the claim. This centralization extended to the establishment of a standing military force commanded by officials dependent on the ruler, underscoring power consolidation through military structures. However, the textbook does not explicitly address wealth redistribution within the military, focusing more on administrative and political aspects. In contrast, The African Times articles provide examples of strategic promotions, such as the appointment of officers like Lieutenant P. J. Hankin as Colonial Secretary for Sierra Leone and promotions within the West India Regiments, aimed at consolidating power and ensuring loyalty. The introduction of prize competitions for gunners, offering monetary rewards and badges, aligns with incentivizing performance. The articles also mention the redistribution of wealth in the context of the former Prime Minister of Madagascar, whose wealth was divided among rising officers, indicating a form of wealth redistribution. However, the articles also highlight criticisms of the military's role in civil administration and the negative impact of appointing unqualified officers to civil positions, suggesting that not all promotions were strategic or beneficial.

Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule.

With this dictum in mind, all the European powers utilized in their military establishments elements recruited from the indigenous population. Although organization and effectiveness varied both according to region and particular national purposes, such colonial troops primarily performed police functions in the inter-war era and were joined by newly created constabulary forces in this capacity. Yet because they were frequently made to serve in geographical regions culturally and ethnically unfamiliar to them, African soldiers were thus alienated from their own society and were often received with hostility by the local populations they forcefully encountered. As a result of this condition and, furthermore, of the European denial of command positions to Africans, the army never came to play the political role in the independence movements that its counterparts in Asia and the Near East did.

Thus the loss of the war of resistance against the colonial powers could quite easily lead to a loss of faith in the old priests and gods and to a decision to embrace the supposedly superior faith of the conquerors. The success of the conquerors had other side effects as well. The old military classes, where they existed, could not continue, under the new dispensation, to live on militarism. Nor could the old political elite who had lived by ruling continue to do so unless they were recruited into the political service of the colony whether as 'native authorities' under indirect rule or as tax collectors and intelligence agents under the so-called direct rule. In other words, many of the old political, military, economic and religious elites had to embrace new professions either in place of or in addition to the old ones. Thus not all who seized the new economic opportunities offered by alien rule did so simply in response to the attractions of the new economic regime. Some who migrated to the new urban centres did so not just because of the lure of urbanism, but because the military conquest and the consequent political settlement made their positions in the rural areas obsolescent and untenable.

Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920.

Administration at the 'grass roots' was more uniform (and similar to that found elsewhere in West Africa). The smallest units, households or camps, were grouped into larger units, defined by a territory or by kinship. Generally pastoralists, Tuareg or Fulbe, were more organized through links of kinship than were agriculturalists, and in consequence retained their own ardo'en or tambura as leaders. Their cohesion gave them a political strength that the more fragmented agriculturalists did not have, but this superior strength relative to the rest of the population did not last into the second half of the century.\nIn larger, long-settled towns and villages ward representatives could be co-ordinated by one of their number, known as the mai gari, magaji, dagaci or mukoshi.

As a necessary part of tax collection, the administration gathered political information, ratified appointments; collected shares of inheritance, took charge of and dispatched the property of strangers who died en route; organized the arrest of a criminal or a runaway slave, forwarded defendants in civil cases, arranged the release of someone wrongfully detained or someone to be ransomed; took intractable cases for mediation by the office› holder or themselves answered charges of oppression by complainants at the amir's personal court; and in time of war organized the recruitment of people for campaigns.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.598, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate and Borno', 'section_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80 > The office of caliph', 'content': ""As responsibility included retaining the taxes derived from the area, it was appropriate that the richer emirates should fall within the caliph's sphere. For the eastern emirates, particularly Kano and Zaria in the early period, were able to underwrite the caliphal economy. Without these payments it would have been difficult to develop the caliphal capital and its hinterland, or even maintain an appropriate level of generosity for visitors. Captives as well as clothes and other items were sent regularly, but captives in particular were crucial both for expanding the area under cultivation around Sokoto and its outlying villages (for the area had not been a centre of cultivation before), and for putting up adequate defences such as high mud walls and flat-roofed, fireproof houses and building permanent mosques for the new settlements. 8\nThe relationship between Sokoto and Gwandu is too complex to detail here, and in part depended on the personal characters of the amirs at any given time. But there was something of the dual organization so common in West Africa, by which Gwandu had the role of uncle and represented ritual authority (the amirs of Gwandu were notable for their piety) while at Sokoto the caliph had the role of the active nephew, in charge of affairs with ultimate political authority. Such a relationship seems to have held between 'Abdullah and Bello, and between Khafil and 'All; it forestalled any conflict and justified Gwandu's relative lack of interest in expanding its control over its subordinate emirates.\nThe relationship between the other amirs and the caliph during the period 1820-45 was imbued more with the equality of former comradesin-arms and fellow students than with the formality of superior and inferior. In particular, Yakubu of Bauchi, a veteran of the early community and not a Fulbe like the others, had a special, almost avuncular, link with the caliphs after Bello's death. There was inevitably a considerable degree of autonomy as each amir consolidated his territorial position; but it is hard to be sure if certain appointments within an emirate (such as Kano) were not being vetted or recommended by the caliph in the same way as Shaykh 'Uthman had carefully controlled appointments during the djihäd by tïïº strict allocation of flags."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.596, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""in the exercise of local authority.

This is a great truth, and great evils arise wherever it is ignored or disregarded. The West Coast of Africa has furnished abundant evidence of this. There is nothing more costly to a country and a government than cheap officials, especially in the higher grades of the public service. Year after year we have been urging upon the Colonial-office that the salaries of the superior Imperial officers on the West Coast were inadequate; not because the persons then employed there were, as a rule, worth more than they received, but because the emoluments of the offices being so small when compared with the expenses the holding them entailed on the officials, they were sought for and, for the most part, filled by a class of men who, both intellectually and morally, were dear at any price; and as such exercised a most pernicious influence, lowering the prestige of the British name, and helping further to debase the population they ought to have contributed both by precept and example to elevate and purify. When it was urged that the revenue of the colonies and settlements on the West Coast would not allow of such an increase as we advocated, we said, abolish some of the offices, and consolidate the salaries for a few superior individuals. But nothing was done. The cheap and nasty system was maintained, and Blackalls, and Hugginses, and Montagus, and Usshers and Parkers were allowed to go on dishonouring Great Britain, insulting and injuring the African people, tyrannising over unhappy individuals who fancied they had rights as British subjects and living under British rule, and degrading the administration of justice until many of the courts stank in the nostrils of all within their influence. Still we persevered in our advocacy of the only good and wise system—proper pay and proper men. Two of the latter, to our astonishment, had accepted the highest appointments on the Coast without the former; and we hailed first with joy the advent of Chief Justice French in the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone, and later with ardent delight and hope that of Sir Arthur Kennedy, C.B., in the Government House of that same metropolitan colony of West Africa. It is needless for us to say to the readers of the African Times what a blessing these good men have already proved to the people among whom they so worthily fill the highest public offices; and how the brilliance they shed on the offices they hold have served by contrast to make Usshers, Hugginses, Montagus, and Parkers increasingly odious and insupportable. Well, shall we say that we have been trembling lest these men, so inadequately remunerated, should seek to leave the Coast for other more lucrative appointments elsewhere? We do not hesitate to confess it; and our readers will therefore be able to judge in some degree of the delight with which we have received the assurance that the Colonial-office have willingly agreed to an augmentation of salary to the Governor-in-Chief, which the people of Sierra Leone are only too desirous to grant out of their rapidly-increasing revenues, and also that they have under their consideration the advisability, the necessity, and indeed the justice of an increase to the chief of the Supreme Court. We believe that public money has never been anywhere better appropriated than will be that of Sierra Leone in payment of larger salaries than hitherto to Sir Arthur Kennedy and Chief Justice French; and we thank the Colonial-office, in the name of the people of the West Coast, for having recognised at one and the same time the principle for which we have always contended, and the just claims of those whom the people delight to honour.

There is a tendency in the military element everywhere to be despotic and oppressive; and in our West African settlements it has had a pretty good field for the exercise of its selfish energies. In the comparative infancy of the British settlements, when the local revenues were very small, and there were no educated native people, it may have been necessary or convenient to confer certain civil government and magisterial offices upon military men in garrison. But the practice was so injurious that only very extreme necessity could ever justify it; and that necessity no longer anywhere exists. Military ascendancy on the West Coast is an unmitigated evil, and we shall oppose it until it be finally destroyed. If the officers in the British West India regiments employed one after another on the West Coast do not receive pay adequate to their services, let the Imperial Government increase their pay out of its own revenues, and not supplement it by injurious exactions on the revenues of the settlements. The officers of the West India Regiments are, for the most part,* men of very low mental calibre, and of very imperfect education, and among these Major Bravo, now in command in Sierra Leone, is perhaps one of the worst specimens. Is it not, then, a most atrocious injustice that because this creature of Major Blackall, the ex-Governor, was made by him stipendiary police magistrate, that he should still be allowed to insult, in this capacity, the people of Sierra Leone, among whom there are so many men so far his superiors, morally and intellectually, that it would be an insult to them to institute any comparison between him and them? On what possible ground can it be justified that such a man as Major Bravo should be saddled on the Sierra Leone revenues for 600l. a-year, only to extend his sphere of mischief in the capacity of a magistrate, and to give him power to insult such men as Mr. Rainy with impunity, to bring the military into increased odium with the community at large, and the administration of justice into loathing and contempt. To retain such a man in such an office at Sierra Leone, is a most unjustifiable insult to the people, is disgraceful to the British Government, and a gross plunder of the colonial revenues. Then, again, look at the performance of magisterial duties at Cape Coast by Colonel Delamaine Mends. Is not this something at which every man in authority in the office in Downing-street ought to blush (page 128). Does it not exhibit that the system of the British Government in the West African settlements is a system of plunder, and nothing else. If the Acting Administrator has the power to dictate to the magistrate what warrant he shall or shall not grant, and what his decisions are to be, is it not a despicable thing that a man should consent to be such a tool; a discreditable farce that there should be such a magistrate to be paid out of the local revenues at the rate of a guinea per hour? If the Acting Administrator possesses such power, why is it not ordered that he shall himself sit as magistrate, and save to the settlement the pay of a magistrate. It would be much more fair for the Government to say at once to all persons residing there, ""You will please to observe that you are to live under an irresponsible despotism, and to have no will but that of the governor, and no redress for anything you may suffer from him."" Men would be able to understand this; but they cannot understand such a system as actually prevails, while being told at the same time that they are living under the protection of British laws. We are sorry to have to mention the name of Captain Russell, at Accra, in conjunction with two such military magisterial specimens as Major Bravo and Colonel Mends, because we have before heard much in his praise; but ""Roll him out"" is not the sort of language that will cause the Administrator or the administration of justice to be respected.

We felt it to be our duty last month to state fully our convictions as to what the public interests of the West Coast demanded, as regards the delegation of power by the Governor-in-Chief on occasions of his temporary absence from the seat of his Government at Sierra Leone; and we think we showed beyond dispute that the delegation of the supreme power to any officer of a corps in garrison on such occasions was not only a public injury and wrong, but was in effect an unjustifiable and dangerous departure from that judicious policy of the Home Government which makes the military power in the colonies and dependencies of Great Britain subservient to the civil power in the person of the Governor-in-Chief; that in all cases of the absence of the latter from the principal seat of his Government, the Colonial Secretary should, by virtue of his office, become Acting Governor-in-Chief; that it is the duty of the Home Government to send out, and that they are supposed to send out to the West Coast, as Colonial Secretaries, persons fit and qualified to hold temporarily such command—and that the Governor-in-Chief, delegating his powers temporarily to such Colonial Secretary, is free from all responsibility as to the mode in which he exercises the trust thus confided in him; while, on the other hand, if the Governor-in-Chief delegate his powers to any officer of the military in garrison he is acting in opposition to the policy of the Home Government, and would be and ought to be held personally responsible for everything done by the said military officer in virtue of the powers thus improperly placed in his hands.

This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.605, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Copy of the Report of Col.

Admitting fully the necessity for a large and more highly paid staff of officers in an African Colony than is required in one more congenial to the European constitution, an expenditure of 7,127l.

By this means the adjustment of prices must necessarily be done by the commercial community at one stroke, and though there may be a falling-off of trade for a period, stability of trade will be sooner arrived at than in the case where prices are gradually put up.\n\nThe system of the division of the Protectorate for administrative purposes was reorganised during the year, and the Protectorate has been divided into three divisions for administrative purposes—the Eastern, the Central, and the Western,—each division being placed under a Divisional Consular officer.

There are many considerations which help to produce in us these feelings of satisfaction. Year after year reproach has been hurled at the West Coast in Parliament and elsewhere, because of the expenses entailed on the Imperial Exchequer by the naval and military forces there employed; it being ignored or forgotten that the chief expense thus incurred was in the carrying out of an Imperial policy in efforts to extinguish a nefarious traffic, which we had heretofore nationally participated in to an extent that made our guilt greatly to surpass that of any other nation, whether European or Transatlantic, in this matter. This reproach of the West Coast must now cease. Events in Cuba negative the supposition that there will ever again be a demand for slaves in that quarter; and the repeal of the Aberdeen Act shows that entire confidence is now placed in Brazil that she will never again allow the importation of an African slave into her dominions. So the squadron is to be at once reduced by three ships, and arrangements made for a further reduction next year. At all events there will be no further charge on this score against the West Coast; as whatever force is kept will not be because it is intended for her benefit, but because it is necessary for the protection of British interests and to keep that police of the seas which is the duty of so great a maritime and commercial power. Then again we have satisfaction in the reduction of the military element; first, on the same grounds as alluded to in the case of the navy; secondly, because (and we say it with deep regret) the military has been a demoralising element on the West Coast, neutralising but too much the effect of missionary teaching and example, and inciting civil officials to like evil practices; thirdly, because of the great and crying evil of the appointment of most improper and unqualified men as magistrates, and to other civil employments that ought to be held by educated natives, simply because they were officers in garrison, and were seeking emoluments in addition to their military pay and allowances; and, again, because we think the time has come when the formation of local corps ought to commence wherever such corps are necessary. There are many other considerations which help, as we have said, to produce our feelings of satisfaction, to which we have not now time and space to allude. But there is one which we cannot pass by even for a single month. We mean the report to Her Majesty's Government attributed by Mr. Cardwell, the Secretary of State for War, to Captain J. H. Glover, the Administrator of Lagos, that Lagos did not any longer require the presence of even a single Imperial soldier within her borders. We had ourselves already stated that not one was necessary, and that being unnecessary the presence of even one was injurious to those most important interests of Lagos which are involved in the return of a good and friendly understanding between the British Colony and the people of the interior. We think and hope that this declaration of the Administrator of Lagos, and the evident delight with which it is hailed by the British Government, will do much to convince the justly jealous Egbass that there is no intention or desire of the territorial aggrandisement of Lagos at their expense. A steady persistence in this wise and just policy will in time disarm Abeokuta of all her suspicions—will make her people cordially co-operate with Lagos, each in their own sphere and dominion, for the advancement of all works that may tend to the development of material resources, the increase of trade and commerce, and the advancement of Christian civilisation; and will raise Lagos to a position of great commercial supremacy among the British colonies and settlements on the West Coast of Africa.

At Lagos the Admiralty has hitherto supplied the service of two gun-boats, which have been employed in the navigation of the lagoons, and in communicating with vessels outside the entrance.\n\nFrom the shallowness of the water of the lagoons it is necessary that the vessel employed in their navigation should have a very light draft of water, whilst, for going outside, the heavy sea that prevails on the bar necessitates the employment of a larger and deeper steamer.\n\nAlthough two vessels are thus required for the use of the settlement, it would be quite possible to dispense with the services of the larger, except at particular periods; for example, when the arrival of the mail, men-of-war, or store-ships, &c., was expected; but during these intervals she might proceed to the Gold Coast, and afford the Governor of that settlement an opportunity of visiting some of his numerous out-stations.

The whole number of rank and file on the West Coast of Africa is 844, whereas the strength of a regiment and a-half ought to be 1,250. That is accounted for by the difficulty of recruiting. I am happy to say that one old source of recruiting—viz., the slave trade—has ceased to furnish us with recruits. In consequence of that both the late Governor Blackall and Governor Kennedy recommended a concentration of forces, and I am sure the committee will be glad to hear that the colony of Lagos, of which we have heard so much, has now arrived at such a state of prosperity that the Governor has stated that he can dispense entirely with the presence of British troops.

The grand lesson of the slave trade era long driven home in West and Central Africa, and being learnt in East Africa in the course of the nineteenth century, was that the way to survive and perhaps even profit from the slave trade was to strengthen the structures and military basis of state power.\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, as we have noted in most parts of Africa, 'the political and economic structures ... seemed to have a certain fragility about them. There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority.

These facilitated, partly caused, and were also in part the result of the changes we have noted above in the political structures and military systems. More than that, there was a growing demand for labour outside the customary bounds of the household unit, the village community or age grade associations. While the various societies remained resistant to freemen selling their labour, the predominant tendency in the nineteenth century was towards expansion of the scale of slave labour, an increase in the areas in which enforced labour was used, and a greater use of migrant labour. The general trend in the third quarter of the nineteenth century was for increased slaveholding in general, even in rural areas, an increase in the number of slaves held within each household, and an increase in the use of slaves in production under quasi-capitalist conditions, thus making their lives harsher than ever before. 18 With the intensification of political rivalries from the very beginning of the century, it became usual to press disputes over land, cattle, and even doctrinal differences to the point of completely destroying the enemy as an identifiable entity. Whole communities were incorporated into existing polities or dispersed and the bulk of the young men and women taken away as captives. Such captives were used to satisfy the increasing demand for labour in agriculture, craft production and mining and also as warriors in the emerging professional armies. The new state structures and military systems diminished the importance of the old aristocracies, whose members had depended on the accumulation of wives and extended families for their social, economic and political support, but they also created new bureaucratic groups that needed to be freed from normal agricultural duties. These new aristocracies depended not on large kinship groups as such, but on large households of clients and captives who maintained increasingly large farms to provision the household as well as groups of warriors at the battlefront.

At one extreme I have discussed Makana, the Xhosa prophet of the early nineteenth century. At the other extreme I have discussed the Zambezi rising of 1917 and its links with FRELIMO. But at least I have so far limited discussion to armed resistance to white invasion or to armed uprisings against colonial rule as it began to 'bite'; the chronological extensions arise from the uneven nature of white advance into Africa and from the still more uneven establish› ment of effective colonial control. Using this essentially political definition the period between 1880 and 1900 emerges as a crucial period of resistance, even if many of the great attempts to redefine sovereignty through protest took place later.\nIf we now turn in conclusion to the developing emphasis on economic resistance, the chronological limits become even less clearly defined. Perhaps the most radical reinterpretation is that of Samir Amin. Amin argues that the really crucial West African resistances to Europe came in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and he dismisses the resist› ances of the Scramble period itself as the half-hearted, rearguard actions of an already compromised ruling class.

They also set themselves the task of refuting and disproving racist ideas and practices in a series of articles, pamphlets, books and speeches, and it was this that gave rise to the second of the unique processes of the period, namely, the intellectual revolution and the accompanying birth of African racial consciousness, pan-Africanism and the concept of the African personality. The pioneers of this revolution in West Africa were undoubt› edly James Africanus Horton (1835-83) and Edward Wilmot Blyden (18321912). Among the works of Horton on the themes in question were Political Economy of British Western Africa, with the requirements of the several colonies and settlements: An African view of the Negro place in Nature (1865); West African Countries and Peoples: A Vindication of the African Race (1868); and Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast (1870). In West African Countries and Peoples, Horton refuted the idea of inherent racial inferiority of the black man by arguing that the difference in the stages of civilization between whites and blacks arose 'entirely from the influence of external circumstances'. To those who moved from the assump› tion of racial inferiority of the black to the assumption that he would ultimately disappear from the face of the earth in the face of white power, Horton argued: we find that wherever the African race has been carried to ... they increase, no matter under what depressing and burdensome yoke they may suffer; from which it may be safely inferred that the African people is a permanent and enduring people, and the fancies of those who had determined their destruction will go in the same limbo as the now almost defunct American slavery. 40 Finally, in answer to the proposition that the black was incapable of improvement, he argued: 'Africans are not incapable of improvement, but that by the assistance of good and able men they are destined to figure in the course of time, and to take a prominent part in the history of the civilized world'.$^{41}$ Again in his Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast, Horton wrote in the Preface: Horton not only condemned racism but was also one of the earliest advocates of pan-Africanism.

A panoramic view of Africa on the eve of the European conquest suggests discernible, predominant trends in spite of the diverse varieties of states, peoples and polities, and seemingly divergent tendencies. A predominant trend would appear to have been the determined effort on the part of various African leaders to strengthen their power and their capacity to defend African territories and interests. These efforts were, however, systematically undermined and eventually subverted by the European presence.\nAs the chapters in this volume have shown, the nineteenth century in Africa was a period of rapid and sometimes contradictory changes. Up to the third quarter of the century, the most far-reaching and widespread of the changes had their origin in internal factors. Other changes were much affected or even initiated by European commercial, missionary or consular activities operating on the coast and, especially after 1850, increasingly penetrating into the interior. Some of the movements for change, such as the efforts of some rulers to unify Ethiopia and reform its institutions, were local in their impact. Others, like the activities of the ambitious khØdives of Egypt in the Nile valley had repercussions throughout a whole region. The Mfecane had begun as a local affair, but soon spread over the whole of Southern, Central and parts of East Africa and, even on the eve of the European conquest, the history of these areas was still largely the history of the states that had resulted from it or were very much affected by it. 1', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Much has been written about the African response to foreign penetration and eventual rule towards the end of the last century and the beginning of the present. Most of the discussion, if not all of it, has been centred on the dichotomy between resisters, who by implication are to be praised as heroes, and so-called collaborators, who also by implication are to be condemned as traitors. This classification came about as a result of the nationalist struggle for independence in Africa, as elsewhere in the world. Those involved in the movement tended to see themselves as heirs to a long tradition of struggle whose roots go back to the beginning of this century, if not earlier. It was assumed that independence was a good thing and to strive for it was natural. Consequently, all those who had resisted European penetration of Africa, in order to preserve its inde› pendence, were heroes to be emulated and given an honourable place in the histories of the countries that had gained their independence through resistance to colonial rule. Put in these terms, this view is an attempt to use the standards of the present, with the aid of hindsight, to interpret the events of the past. In the colonial situation, those who resisted were described by colonial officials as short-sighted while those who collaborated were seen as far-sighted. Today, nationalist historians in East Africa con› demn so-called collaborators, especially chiefs, and praise resisters. 1\nAmong the resisters, there were also divisions. There were those who took to armed confrontation with the intruders - active resistance. Then there were those who, though they did not take to arms, refused to co› operate with the intruders.

This is a question that has so far not been seriously considered by historians, African or European, but it needs to be answered. The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy. Asante must remain as of old at the same time to remain friendly with all white men. I do not write this in a boastful spirit but in the clear sense of its meaning ... the cause of Asante is progressing and there is no reason for any Asante man to feel alarm at the prospects or to believe for a single instant that our cause has been driven back by the events of the past hostilities. 2\nIn 1895, Wobogo, the Moro Naba, or King of the Mossi (in modern Upper Volta), told the French officer, Captain Destenave: I know that the whites wish to kill me in order to take my country, and yet you claim that they will help me to organize my country. But I find my country good just as it is. I have no need of them.

There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

What were the effects of all this on Africa, its peoples and their political, social and economic structures and institutions? Finally, what is the significance of colonialism for Africa and her history? These are the questions that this volume will attempt to answer.\nFor the purpose of answering these questions, and explaining African initiatives and responses in the face of the colonial challenge, this volume has been divided, apart from the first two chapters, into three main sections. Each section is preceded by a chapter (3, 13, 22) in which the theme of the section is surveyed in a general way and from a continental perspective, and the subsequent chapters are dealt with on a regional basis. The intro› ductory section comprising this and the next chapter discusses African attitudes and preparedness on the eve of this fundamental change in the relations between Africa and the Europeans, and the reasons for the par› tition, conquest and occupation of Africa by the European imperial powers. It should be pointed out, since this is often ignored, that the phase of actual conquest was preceded by years of negotiation and treaty-making between the imperial powers and African rulers. This phase of negotiation shows that the European powers originally accepted their African counter› parts as their equals, and, secondly, that the former did recognize the sovereignty and independence of the African states and polities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The expression of African nationalism and politics', 'content': ""All these expressions of African nationalism and anti-colonial politics constituted the antithesis in the dialectical relationship between the European colonizers and the colonized Africans. The general reactions of the colonial regimes in seeking to tighten control by the use of physical force and the imposition of legal disabilities were understandable in view of the fact that the period witnessed the expansion of autocracies and illiberal tendencies in Europe itself. But it was not just the opposition of the Africans which was making the colonial regimes insecure. The spread of European ideas and institutions proved a sore point for the colonizers. The general attempt to limit the quality and scope of education was predicated upon the fear that European education and political and social ideas were destructive of colonialism as a system of relations. It was the desire to avert the danger that was looming that explained the general denunciation of education in the humanities at all levels, and the preference for rural schools, vocational schools, and technically-orientated postsecondary institutions which were concerned with intermediate manpower, but not universities. The idea was to avoid the example of India where the spread of liberal education had been a major lever for the expansion of anti-colonial and nationalistic politics. This is the explanation for the orientation and scope of such colleges as the Ecole William Ponty in French West Africa, and the Yaba Higher College (Nigeria), Achimota College (Gold Coast), Gordon's College, Khartoum, and Makerere College in British East Africa. 18 But the attempt to regulate the measure and type of social change that could take place in the colonies was itself another source of anti-colonial grievances that fuelled the nationalist movements. The world economic crisis worsened the situation in two ways. It limited the resources available to the colonial regimes to be viable without any subvention from the metropolis. The general tendency was to keep the colonial regimes going by cutting down on expenditures on amenities and infrastructures that could benefit the colonized by the freezing of job opportunities regardless of the disruptive impact of unemployment on the societies. At the same time, the pauperizing exactions made against the colonized became greater with higher taxes, frequent use of cheap and forced labour, in a situation in which farmers were receiving diminishing returns for their raw materials while paying higher prices for imported European manufactures."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""As indicated in Chapters 6 and 12, resistance to colonialism in most parts of West Africa died down during the First World War. Indeed, as M. Crowder has shown,$^{1}$ except in parts of the Ivory Coast, Niger, the Gold Coast (now Ghana) and the eastern parts of Nigeria, most West Africans showed loyalty to their colonial rulers during the war and some of the traditional rulers even voluntarily contributed men and resources in the form of money to the imperial war effort. However, after the war, African reactions to colonialism were resumed with even greater vigour and determination. Indeed, if the period from 1919 to 1935 has been described as the high noon of colonialism in West Africa, it was also the period that saw African resistance to colonialism and nationalist activities in West Africa at its peak.\nAfrican nationalism and political activities in West Africa during this period were shaped by a number of factors. These were the impact of the First World War, the colonial situation itself, an increase in the number of the educated and professional elite as well as the working class, especially in the urban centres, the general economic conditions of the 1920s and 1930s, the socio-economic changes in the rural areas caused by the spread of the cultivation of cash crops, and finally, the diffusion of pan-Africanism and pan-Africanist activities into West Africa. Crowder (Chapter 12) has discussed in detail the impact of the First World War on Africa and on nationalist activities. Suffice it to state here first and foremost that the forced conscription of many Africans aroused a great deal of anger especially in the former French African areas. Secondly, the war proved to the African that the white man was after all not a superman and could therefore be resisted. Thirdly, after the war, 'loyalist' West Africans were expecting rewards for their loyalty in the form of more concessions and more participation in the running of their own affairs, a feeling which was very much strengthened by the principles of liberal democracy and selfdetermination enunciated by President Woodrow Wilson of the United States and Prime Minister David Lloyd George of Great Britain. All these factors undoubtedly made a good number of West Africans more ready than before to participate in the anti-colonial and resistance movements."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'During the period 1880 to 1914, the whole of West Africa, with the sole exception of Liberia (see Chapter 2), was brought under colonial rule. This phenomenon which meant essentially the loss of African sovereignty and independence as well as land, was accomplished in two phases. The first phase lasted from 1880 to the early 1900s, and the second from the early 1900s to the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Each of these phases saw different European activities which produced different initiatives and reactions on the part of the Africans. It should be emphasized that these reactions were very much determined by the local African situation. Variables included the nature of the polity (whether or not centralized, whether or not dominated by another African power, and whether or not on the upswing or settled and declining), 1 the nature of the leadership provided, the extent of the penetration of European political, religious and economic influences by the 1870s and the experiences gained from this. Another equally important variable was the method adopted by the European imperialists in the establishment of their control over the area between 1880 and 1914.\nThe first phase saw either the use of diplomacy or military invasion, or both, by the Europeans. This was the classical era of treaty-making in practically every nook and corner of West Africa followed in most cases by military invasions, conquests and occupation by armies of varying sizes and discipline. The period from 1880 to 1900 was the high-water mark of European conquest and occupation of West Africa. Never in the known history of the continent has so much military action been seen and so many invasions and campaigns launched against African states and communities (see Fig. 6.1). Particularly memorable were the French campaigns in the Western Sudan, Ivory Coast and Dahomey (now Benin) between 1880 and 1898, and the British campaigns in Asante (in what is now Ghana), the Niger Delta region (Nigeria) and in Northern Nigeria between 1895 and 1903 (see Fig. 6.2).', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Political and social developments in the colonial situation were a product of the interactions between the colonizer on the one hand, and the colonized on the other. In a sense, the orientations of African leadership elites were shaped partly by the form of colonial administration. Where the administra› tions were regional in structure and/or policy, as in the French colonial federations, the African leaders tended to adopt a regional outlook. Hence, champions of African nationalism in the inter-war period (wanasiasa as they are known in Swahili) have been referred to as being primarily panAfricanists rather than nationalists in the European sense. The point was that nationalism was taking a reverse course to the expression of the same phenomenon in Europe. Contrary to what happened in Europe, the state was created before the cultural nations that would make it a meaningful political community were welded together. It is in this sense that one should take James Coleman's observation that: ... the drive behind African nationalism in many instances is not the consciousness of belonging to a distinct politico-cultural unit which is seeking to protect or assert itself, but rather it is the movement of racially-conscious modernists seeking to create new political and cultural nationalities out of the heterogenous people within the artificial boundaries imposed by the European master ... '\nWe must recognize that colonialism, as a system of relations, rests upon some kind of racialism, and that since development in a colonial situation is a product of interactions between the colonizer and the colonized, racial consciousness is basic to the growth of nationalism as a search for sovereignty and independence.\nThat African nationalists are regarded as 'modernists' is a reflection of the fact that they were operating within an externally defined setting which imposed alien systems of values, norms, and definitions of political and social developments to which they had to subscribe as a condition for success. That nationalism in Africa is a dynamic, ongoing phenomenon is clear from the extensive literature on themes like nation-building and irredentism. Probably an accurate word for this phenomenon in Africa - as E. S. Atieno-Odhiambo shows in Chapter 26 - is the Swahili word siasa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Related to ideology as a factor is the settler factor.

B. Davidson and Michael Crowder in the 1960s, should be briefly looked at.\nSome historians have proposed 1870 as the date for the beginning of the European Scramble for Africa and the imposition of colonial rule. This date, however, seems to be too early. As G. N. Uzoigwe shows in Chapter 2, it was the activities of the French in the Senegambia region, of King Leopold of the Belgians represented by H. M. Stanley, and the French represented by Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza in the Congo region, and of the Portuguese in Central Africa that touched off the Scramble and all these activities surely did not commence until the late 1870s and early 1880s.

But through the medium of your valuable journal let us be permitted to remind our fellow-citizens that all that has been hitherto accomplished is but rudimentary. Scarcely anything more than a primary move is yet made. The main work, the mighty task which our pretensions involve (and which, if faithfully pursued and fulfilled, is to be echoed by generations in the far-off future), lies yet before us. Success, be it observed, is in no wise ensured thereby, though the *coup d\'essai* promises much; nor is the success of administration to be tossed up or chanced to any cycle\'s policy, as though the *coup de grâce* depended on fortune. Such a work cannot, must not, be done at haphazard. Sound and definite plans by sound men of purpose, must be laid as bases of general operation. And the question here arises, Where are the men who are willing to come forward and take the helm? Those already at work are just a handful, and but necessarily so, for there are in Africa, as were in the land of Israel and elsewhere, selfish and time-serving Issachars, intelligent and well-informed gentlemen—asses crouching, all lengths, between the burden of sensible duty, as citizens, and mean, narrow self-love. The Gold Coast has certainly its fair quota of such precious fellows—qualified citizens of all shades and degrees—who find their sum and life total of bliss in money-making, and prefer inglorious ease to patriotic service. We are, under these circumstances, fairly puzzled as to how this much-talked-of Confederation could successfully carry out the vast designs of its glorious mission. For our part, we shall be willing to overlook all past political differences, and *pro bono publico* emerge, and, if possible, convert divergent and opposite opinions into one universal harmonious whole, and to bring, at all events, the collected action of the *élite* as well as the general intelligence of the community, to bear on what we consider highly momentous questions, and objects most desirable to attain, at any rate in the first stages of the business. There is a vast deal to do, and in order to accomplish it, there must not only be energy and honest vigour on the part of those already in office, but also a general response to the country\'s call, and the utmost disposition and concern on the part of all such civilized and educated natives as have hitherto ""tarried"" behind ""by the stuff,"" and of all interested in the country\'s welfare, to merge all minor interests, conceits, and petty prejudices in the national will, and in the ""transcendent duties of patriots,"" and come forward with a purpose to discharge the duties due from them as responsible sons of the country. And now, shall the country appeal in vain? Will not right men, having noble views, come forward at this crisis to their right place in the government of the country? We record with pride and pleasure that already some worthy persons of education, position, and intelligence, such as Mr. Edmund Bannerman and Mr. Samuel Davis, are actually on the move to join their brethren in the construction of the Fanti Confederate Government. Capital men! may Heaven bless them and all such! But alas! the supply is by no means adequate to the need. There is a sad paucity in the number of *educated Fantis* and *Accras* who have as yet evinced any care to help their country. A precious lot of these, more or less qualified, skulk ingloriously on the background. Why, countrymen and friends, what are you at? Why quarter ignominiously in the rear, such as Messrs. Junior Davidson, Tom Renny, C. Brown, John Sarbah, Richard Blankson, Francis Williams, John Hammond (Mr. Hammond, who, on several occasions before, has been his country\'s man), W. B. Davis, John Duker, Mark Hansen, and the rest, at Accra and the Western districts, whom we cannot name now? Why do not these follow in the wake of their friends and brethren? We cannot do one without the other, nor yet even can we afford to affect fastidiousness in respect of private minor defects in intelligence, character, and circumstances.

There is much to discourage us in our work for Africa and its people. It is so difficult to make those who, for themselves and their posterity, are most interested in the results we may achieve comprehend how hard the task of social and administrative reformation is; and that it is their and our duty to persevere in efforts to obtain and secure it, in spite of all the obstacles that vice and egotism, long enthroned evils in West Africa, may marshal against us. Vicious authority is rampant, insolent, and seductive, and its scoffs and sneers and bribes are not without effect among the victims at whose expense it exists, thrives, and debauches; and it is not difficult for it to induce many of them to range themselves on its side, and against those the best part of whose lives is being consumed in constant and unrewarded exertions to procure for them those changes which are indispensable to their social and national progress.

Africa has long presented an awful spectacle to the civilized world, which, in the pursuit of its own selfish objects, indifferent to all feelings of humanity and to the most sacred principles of Christianity, had during many generations assisted in deepening her misery and desolation. Miserable, desolated, and degraded she must needs have been in herself, as the voluntary prey of the most hideous and bloody superstitions that have ever enslaved mankind; but all this was undoubtedly aggravated and intensified by that infernal foreign slave trade, which sets tribe against tribe throughout the land for the making of captives, who might be exchanged with the foreign slave trader for trumpery finery, improved implements of slaughter, and intoxicating drinks. That slave trade, extinguished on the West Coast, seems now to be doomed on the East also; and if this be accomplished, that by the desert route will ere long share the same fate. Event succeeds event with a startling rapidity, which seems to us to prove that Africa\'s hour of awakening is at hand. The Zanzibar Treaty, the operations of Sir Samuel Baker, the projected railroad from Egypt to Socatoo, the gold and diamond discoveries of the South, and now the Ashanti War—all within the short space of three or four years—are to our mind indications of a vast providential design, pressing on to realization. And what should this be, but that in these last days of the present dispensation the great tidings of salvation by Christ Jesus our Lord shall be preached ""as a witness"" in that vast interior to which it has never yet penetrated. North, South, East, and West, the pioneers of civilization are preparing or penetrating; and whatever form these agencies may assume, the tidings of the glorious Gospel of our Blessed Lord will follow in their wake. Much as we deprecate war, we cannot ignore the fact that it has been overruled to be an instrument for the destruction of those cruel forms of heathenism which had usurped dominion over the greater portion of the earth, and for the removal of obstacles to the proclamation of the all-important truths of the everlasting Gospel. Nothing less than an armed intervention, such as that conducted by Sir Samuel Baker, could have succeeded against the Arab slave dealers about the sources of the Nile. For years past we have been calling on our own Government to make roads, real roads, throughout the Protected Territories on the Gold Coast, and to the frontier of Ashanti. We called in vain; but what they would not do leisurely and economically, for the spread of civilization and Christianity, and the peaceful development of nature\'s resources, they will now do hastily and expensively, because it is necessary to those war operations which have been forced upon them solely as a consequence of their own neglect of duty, in not establishing a system of ready communication with the frontier. As civilized Governments now no longer permit their subjects to embark in organized commercial enterprise, sustained by armed operations, such as founded our East Indian Empire; and as the British Government would not push forward the agencies of civilization toward the interior as an effort of peace; while the indurated superstitions and barbarisms of Africa can be shattered only by the exhibition or exercise of power, there can be little doubt that the preliminary action of enlightenment from the West Coast will be the penetration of the interior by military expeditions; forced upon Government, most probably, against their desire and will, as in this present instance of the Ashanti War. In our extreme enlightenment of the nineteenth century, we have shut our eyes to the great truth that God does not bestow empire solely for the gratification of selfish national interests, desires, and wealth; and as this has led to non-performance of duties, we must look for rude awakenings. We would not see our duty as regards the Protected Territories, Ashanti, and Dahomey; we are being forced into the performance of it.

We know how to excuse much of the opposition we encountered. The moral atmosphere of but too many places on the West Coast was so tainted, that Europeans had for the most part thrown off all those restraints which in their own countries they would have acknowledged. Official and unofficial life were pretty much on a par; and it could not be expected that the educated natives should have been able to free themselves from the influence of a baneful example. But for missionary labour, a true picture drawn of our West African settlements would have been revolting and disgraceful indeed. Into this dark arena we descended, fully conscious as regards the combats we should have to sustain. But we had faith in the influence of light. If we could only flood that arena with the light of public opinion, we felt that sooner or later our adversaries, the enemies of Africa, strong or feeble, must change their skins, or slink into holes and corners where they might hide. Consequently, the more we have been opposed, the more light we have endeavoured to throw in. And we enter upon the fourth year of our laborious combat with increased resolve, if that indeed were possible, to leave no Christian effort unemployed for the complete defeat of those auxiliaries of evil which have so long run riot in Africa—to strive to the uttermost for the introduction of all those aids to industrial development and material progress that can be made to work in union with Christianity, by which alone a moral regeneration may also be obtained.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1864#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.744, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE ACTION OF THE AFRICAN-AID SOCIETY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""ROME was not built in a day.

Error is glittering; nothing is easier than to dazzle and win with it. Truth is the reverse of this; and struggles amid difficulty and hardship into appreciation and favour. Look at our great missionary societies. Consult their early records. The Church Missionary Society was at first very coldly received. During some years its income fluctuated from three or four hundred to a thousand pounds a-year. People who could not, or did not, care to see, or were unable to grasp the great principle of its existence, sneered at it, no doubt. It was doing nothing, of course. No one could perceive any rich fruit of its exertions; and yet it had sown and gathered something in from the first seed—and yet it was from the first moment gradually advancing toward the great harvest of its present utility—and yet it had securely laid the foundation of its present goodly edifice. The germ of its actual vigorous life was swelling amid the cerements of the national apathy, anon to throw out its roots, to raise high its head and spread wide its branches; to fatten and flourish in the rich soil and sunshine of popular wealth and favour, and cast around the precious leaves of Christian truth appointed for the healing of the nations.\n\nIt would justly be thought presumptuous in us to liken the African-Aid Society, now struggling through the diseases and feebleness of infancy, with that veteran society whose efforts have been crowned with much success.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes.

The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

In fact it was these two wars on the eastern front and the Orange River Sovereignty that compelled the British to abandon Smith's expansionist policy in South Africa.\nThe causes of the Anglo-Xhosa war of 1850-3 lay in Smith's efforts to deprive the Xhosa of their independence. In 1848 he took away vast Xhosa territories by annexing to the Cape Colony the area between the Fish and Keiskamma rivers and then declaring a separate British Colony of Kaffraria between the Keiskamma and Kei rivers. Many Xhosa were prevented from settling in their former lands west of the Keiskamma, which were now parcelled out to the Mfengu 'loyalists' and white farmers. In Kaffraria itself, the Xhosa were split, up and allotted 'reserves', while their chiefs' powers were severely circumscribed by the supervision of imposed white magistrates. Such customs as labola (bridewealth) and accusations of witch› craft were outlawed as being contrary to British justice. Moreover, the white magistrates knew very little of the Cape Laws and nothing of the Xhosa legal system, with the result that they followed their personal instincts in reviewing Xhosa cases submitted to them. The members of the 500-strong African police force that backed the magistrates were untrained, and so proud to carry out the white man's orders that they became overbearing towards their people. All these grievances forced the Xhosa to try and rid themselves of British rule."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.62, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The colonial regimes were no exception to the truism that every ad› ministration makes use of intermediary structures, largely for reasons of economy and effectiveness.

In both cases there was only limited success, mainly due to the ignorance and presumptuous attitude of 'the experts'. 32 In Kenya and the Rhodesias the production of cash crops increasingly passed into settler hands as the twentieth century advanced. During the first decade of the century African peasant producers in Kenya and Southern Rhodesia competed with white settlers quite effectively in pro› ducing most of the grain which fed the growing numbers of wage earners. Indeed until 1914 African farmers in Kenya contributed more to the cash and export sector than the settlers. This was the period when the settlers were struggling without much success to establish themselves. At this time, too, the impact of the political economy of colonialism was relatively small. Soon the settlers and planters discovered that they could participate effectively in the production of cash crops only if they acted through the respective colonial administrations and systematically reduced the role of African producers to the minimum possible. But settler agriculture, in› efficient as it was, required an ample supply of cheap labour. As one Kenya administrator assessed the situation in 1905, 'native labour is as necessary in the development of the land as are rain and sunshine'. 33 Accordingly a number of steps - mostly imported from South Africa were taken to drive Africans to work for the white man.

The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation.

The development of the colonized was none of their business. Where there was 'development' in the colonies, it was by and large a by-product of activities intended to promote the interests of the colonizers.

These unofficial agents operated especially through com› mercial firms, mining firms and banks. They represented group interests in the colonial legislatures and different committees, or acted as pressure groups. In the absence of well-organized African representation, as was the case in most colonies, white settlers and representatives of expatriate companies were able to obtain many concessions from the colonial govern› ments at the expense of the local populations. Colonial policy and practice, in other words, were shaped by both political and economic determinants. As a matter of fact, in many cases, the unofficial elements affected the local population more directly than the administration did. They bought and collected agricultural products from the former and sold imported goods to them. They also employed indigenous labour. In both cases, there was very little government interference. Evidently the prices of exports and imports and the level of wages affected the people's day-to-day life more than the district commissioner's annual tax-collecting visit to the rural areas.

During the mid-i920s each of these firms had more branches and 'factories' in Sierra Leone than any British firm. 70 Yet there were no safeguards to protect the local population.

In barbarous countries we are led to expect that might is right; but living under the protection of one of the most enlightened Governments on the face of the earth, we fully expected that we should not be subject to anything antagonistic with humanity and natural justice. The manner in which the Gold Coast has been governed by Colonel Conran was enough to cause a general insurrection; and if it were not for the confidence reposed in the Queen of England's Government at home, Colonel Conran would have had much more disastrous news to communicate to Downing-street than has often fallen to the lot of any British ruler.\n\nWe are now anxiously awaiting the arrival of the next mail, which will tell us whether our hopes and confidence had been misplaced or not. It is to be hoped Colonel Conran will not omit to inform the Earl of Carnarvon of the universal rejoicings of the 8th February last, when he left the shores of Cape Coast amidst five thousand curses.

Mr. Brew is indebted to Messrs. Forster and Smith, and although Mr. M'Intyre (up to a few weeks ago, when he was giving balls and dinner parties) did not think it beneath his dignity to invite Mr. Brew and Mr. W. Z.

Mr. Usher, the present Administrator, sent to Apollonia a few days ago a British officer (Lieut. Hamilton) to fine a chief, who is subject to the King of Apollonia, and to arrest two parties living there. It appears that after several threats Lieut. Hamilton arrested the two men, and proceeded to the sea coast. At Apollonia he embarked in a boat with his prisoners, but no sooner was he off the beach than five canoes, with armed Apollonians, pursued him; but on account of their perceiving that he was armed, they gave up the chase, returned on shore, and made prisoners of Lieut. Hamilton\'s hammock-men and carriers, fourteen in number, whom they now hold as hostages.\n\nNow, just fancy such an act as this being perpetrated in the time even of Governor Andrews, Ross, Pine, or Jones. Why, such a thing would be looked upon with the greatest alarm and concern by the whole protectorate. Now, what difference does it make? Why, scarcely anyone knows about it. It is kept as a sort of secret at Government House and the Fort, and well it might be!\n\nWhat I have all along said has come to pass. The British Government exercises no more influence over the kings and chiefs of the Gold Coast Protectorate than the writer of this letter; and, as far as my long acquaintance goes with these people, I cannot come to any other conclusion than that it would be to the credit and advantage of the Home Government either to send out gentlemen, and men of education and experience, to govern this so-called protectorate, or allow the natives to do it themselves. We are plunging deeper and deeper in difficulties every day. Colonel Conran by proclamation says British rule does not exceed fifteen miles in the interior. Mr. Usher sends up an expedition a few weeks after some eighty or ninety miles in the bush to settle some petty dispute between two chiefs, whilst human sacrifice is permitted to have full swing at Akropong, eighteen miles from the British fort at Accra. Your correspondent ""X. Y. Z.,"" writing under date 23rd October last, may well say ""No one can imagine what possible excuse the local authorities can frame for looking on with their hands in their pockets whilst these wholesale public murders are being committed under their very noses,"" particularly when a British civil commandant and magistrate reprimands, in open court, the policeman who gives evidence of these disgraceful facts, of which he was an eye-witness.\n\nI could relate facts as startling as the above, but as I find no attention is given to representation at Downing-street, I look quietly on to see the end of these things.'}, {'id': 1120, 'article_title': 'Latest News by the Ethiope—Awoonlah War', 'full_section_title': 'Latest News by the Ethiope—Awoonlah War', 'last_edit_date': '05-21-1867', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_06_1867#article-5', 'issue_date': '22_06_1867', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—I wrote you lately informing you of the Governor-General\'s call at Accra, _en route_ to Lagos on his annual official visit.

Those whose passage money by the mail steamers must be defrayed out of their private resources are remarkably free from this strange disease.\n\nThe Governor-in-chief being, therefore, unable to come on shore, a deputation of European and native merchants, headed by Nicol Irvine, Esq., J.P., waited on him on board his yacht.

They cannot be for ever kept in the dark. They have no voice in the disposal of their own money. Three or four officials, together with a non-official, who has been recommended for the post partly in consequence of the splendid hospitality one always receives at his house, and partly on account of his influence, sit and vote away their money without studying their interests.

The evidence of his disgraceful unfitness in every way to represent Her Most Gracious Majesty as the chief of the Executive acting in her name on the Gold Coast, which we laid unsparingly before the Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1868, has been disregarded by the Colonial-office, which seems entirely to have overlooked that great blow inflicted on the so-called Protectorate by Mr. Ussher's proceedings in the matter of the transfer of settlements under the British and Dutch treaty. The transfer of inhabitants from British to Dutch rule was made by him without any consultation with the natives and their chiefs, who were thus given up to new masters like so many bartered cattle. Such conduct on the part of the chief of the Executive in a matter of such vital importance to the natives and their country, and which has led to the sacrifice of so many lives, and to a warfare which will cost many more, and do immense injury to trade, ought alone to have been held as disqualifying him from any further public trust. But the Colonial-office have not so judged, and Mr. Ussher has been permitted to resume his post as Administrator. Nothing is therefore left to us but to have the matter brought before the House of Commons next session. Meanwhile, as Her Majesty's Secretary of State has thought fit thus to permit his return as Her Majesty's representative, we shall not allow anything that occurred in the past, and which has already been urged against him at the Colonial-office, to prejudice us in our estimate of his future conduct in the management of Cape Coast affairs.

Mr. Usher seems to have desired, by a show of frankness, and wishing good for the country, to conciliate the goodwill of the natives and those Europeans who had been many years in the country, and who, having gained the respect and confidence of the natives, could by persuasion induce them to do much more than any Administrator could succeed in effecting by force.\n\nHe flattered himself that he could thus succeed in inducing the native chiefs and people of the Eastern districts of the Gold Coast to consent to a kind of patched-up peace with the Awoonlahs; for a real peace is quite out of the question until one side or the other is thoroughly defeated and exhausted. However, any kind of peace would have served his purpose; any chance that would afford an opportunity and furnish material for a grandiloquent despatch to the Duke of Buckingham, announcing the final adjustment of the vexed Awoonlah question, restoration of peace, opening of the Volta, renewal of trade, &c., &c., &c.; accompanied possibly by an ""address"" got up in the usual Gold Coast fashion (of which more next month).\n\nAll this you see, Sir, would have resulted most probably in the Secretary of State sending him by return mail his commission as full administrator by way of reward for his eminent services.*\n\nBut this has not succeeded; for the entire community, European and native (with the exception of two or three parasitical and uninfluential Europeans), having the interests of the country at heart, was opposed to the line of policy which the Acting Administrator had drawn up for them to follow in his lead.', 'last_edit_date': '1867-06-06', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1867#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Abuses, Misgovernment, and Maladministration on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As regards Cape Coast, we must say that the whole system seems to be wrong and rotten in every part.

We do not believe this. We do not believe that Governor Pine is a man likely to allow himself to be made such a tool of. But we can imagine the case of a needy Governor and other public officials coming under pecuniary obligations to a leading member of a Legislative Council thus constituted, until all the power became virtually vested in him. And the possibility of such an abuse as this ought not to be allowed to exist. Then, again, we learn that the acting Civil Commandant for the important Eastern Districts—a young sub-agent of the same firm, and whose nomination to this office was obtained by one of the members of the Legislative Council—that this young man has taken for his chief counsellor and guide the Mr. James Bannerman who was last year sentenced to one year\'s imprisonment, &c., for gross abuses in the administration of justice, in complicity with Major de Ruvignes, the then Chief Civil Commandant, who surreptitiously left the Coast rather than meet the charges against him, and is now said to be shooting, for a wager, gorillas at the Gaboon. Is it any wonder that the Eastern Districts are disaffected? Is it any wonder that with a Legislative Council so constituted, there should be rumours that the Kroboe fine, the source of so many past evils, was to be the cause for fresh complications and disasters, fresh impolicy and injustice? ""Cæsar\'s wife should be not only pure, but above suspicion."" The abuses at the Gold Coast have reached a height that must, we think, induce some vigorous action on the part of the Colonial-office.

The British Government is in a false position there, and some decision as regards a change must soon be arrived at. Our views on this subject are well known. We are bound as a nation to the Gold Coast by ties that we cannot, dare not sever; and it becomes incumbent on us to assume such a position as may be made at the same time creditable to Great Britain and largely advantageous to Africa.

Any one not accustomed to the contemplation of West Coast enormities would imagine that, putting humanity altogether out of the question, the common instincts of self-preservation would stir up the European officials who are sent out to teach civilisation to the natives to insist upon the adoption and enforcement of those ordinary sanitary regulations which simple decency demands, and which are essential to the preservation of the public health even in temperate, and much more in tropical climates. Yet after forty years and more of British Government authority at Cape Coast, the state of the little town and neighbourhood is such as described. In the presence of so offensive, disgusting, and dangerous a state of affairs, are we not justified in becoming disturbers of official tranquillity? It is no doubt the summum bonum of official life to get as much pay, as many perquisites and indulgences, as much consideration and homage, and do as little work as possible; and it is perhaps an excess of impertinence to criticise the conduct of the favoured mortals sent of course expressly into the world to work out so delicious a destiny. But as a common every-day labourer in the vast field of humanity and progress, we have no sympathy with men who are content to enjoy their mistresses and drink their brandy and champagne upon a dungheap, provided they may occupy the highest position of the stinking mass. For after all, if this description be correct, as we know that it is, what are Government House or any other official abodes in the town of Cape Coast but the most elevated sites on a dangerous and offensive dungheap? The only man in office, so far as we remember, who ever made the slightest move toward doing anything for the purification of the streets and roads of Cape Coast Town was that blundering and arbitrary soldier Governor, Colonel Conran, whose one idea of governing was to bring every individual in the community under the provisions of the Mutiny Act. Our columns teemed years ago, before Colonel Conran\'s time, with denunciations of the public filth and indecency of Cape Coast Town, and of the British officials in power who made no effort to apply a remedy. And now of course, with the increase of population, things have gone from bad to worse. Shame and disgrace and infamy be upon successive governors and administrators, colonial surgeons and principal medical officers, who have attended only to their own selfish aims and enjoyments in the presence of the ever-augmenting abomination. We write with warmth; we have lately lost there a dear and cherished friend, who fell a victim to the pestilential atmosphere, and who, it may be, if governors and administrators had done their duty and made Cape Coast Town what it ought to be as a seat of British authority, might have been spared for yet many years of usefulness in the noble work to which she had dedicated the remainder of her existence. She had, it is true, mental anxieties, and a not over vigorous frame, but it was the pestilential fetor atmosphere of a tropical town full of all stinking abominations that killed her. And there is no excuse. There have now for a long time been abundant funds in the colonial chest—the British Administrator lives in the town—a governor-general goes, or ought to go, there occasionally—there is always one principal medical officer (army surgeon) as well as a colonial surgeon—there is (it is now some nine months or more since he was sent out) a Government civil engineer—and yet it seems that nothing effective has been attempted, and Cape Coast Town and its adjacent roads are one vast public privy and dunghill, upon which, as the Editor of the West African Herald justly observes, a general annihilating pestilence may, and most likely will, suddenly swoop down to carry off its thousands of victims. People who do not know what may be done by officials on the West Coast of Africa will perhaps say, ""Oh, things cannot be so bad as that; the Administrator, &c., would certainly take care of himself, and he must incur the same danger there now as others."" This is a great mistake. Let pestilence swoop down, as is but too reasonably anticipated, and the occupant of Government House, as well as other principal officials, would find no difficulty in obtaining leave of absence on urgent medical grounds. We can see no remedy, no efficient remedy, but a change, and a sweeping one, in the whole official system at Cape Coast. With continually augmenting revenues, soon we hope and believe to be doubled or trebled, no sanitary measures are adopted, no roads are planned, much less commenced; men may be flogged in gaol almost to the verge of death, and then sent to shot-drill to close their mouths for ever, and the Colonial-office sits still and looks on with contented self-complacency and admiration, and will, we fear, continue to look on, until the indignant thunderings of an outraged humanity shall make themselves heard from the mouth of some new Brougham amid the plaudits of an electrified House of Commons.

That settlement has been so great a sufferer through official mismanagement, and so many innocent persons have, as a consequence, been wholly or in part ruined, with a serious loss thereby of British capital, that the wounds require soothing by anodynes, not irritating by caustic. During the interview of the commercial deputation with Earl Kimberley in May last, his lordship spoke so confidently as to the merits of Captain Strachan, who might be regarded ""as almost a civilian,"" that we expected to hear of a courteous, confidence-inspiring Administrator installed in his person within the walls of the Government-house at Lagos. We regret, however, that it should be our duty to state that the first impressions at Lagos have not been favourable as regards the new Administrator. If the description came to us from one quarter only, we should have taken no public notice of it; but it comes to us from several and distinct ones; and what we gather is, that his tone is not at all a soothing one; his bearing is lofty, for Africa, and frightens even Europeans away from Government-house. We cannot help feeling that this is a bad beginning. His predecessor, Mr. Berkeley, the present Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast Settlements, gained golden opinions of all in Lagos; he was beloved there; and we never heard that the public service was thereby injured, or the Queen\'s government thereby lowered in the estimation of Europeans or natives. It would be, indeed, lamentable should Colonel Strachan undo what Mr. Berkeley effected; nor do we hesitate to say that such a result would put an end at once and for ever to the system of appointing naval and military men as Administrators of commercial settlements—a system which was, with so much reason, denounced by the deputation, to whose interview with Earl Kimberley we have before alluded.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-11-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_11_1873#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Governors, and other Superior Officials, for the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There are great difficulties in the way of efficient administration on the West Coast. This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE NEW GOVERNOR-IN-CHIEF OF THE GOLD COAST COLONY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Secretary of State for the Colonies deserves all praise for that he has not delayed in appointing a successor to the late Governor Ussher.

The new Governor will, no doubt, soon take possession. Dilatoriness has not been one of the characteristics of Doctor (now Sir) Samuel Rowe. As regards the late Governor Ussher, all we shall say is that he did not fulfil our expectations. We hope and believe that we shall never have to record a similar disappointment as regards Sir Samuel Rowe, who now goes to a colony where the finances are so far from being in a state of chronic embarrassment, that there are ample resources for inaugurating improvements much needed, but hitherto entirely neglected. Sir Samuel has now a fine field for the exercise of those talents which he undoubtedly possesses—energy, activity, and a determination that subordinate officials shall do their duty, and not idly fritter away the public revenues, which ought to be made available for stimulating progress and development. In one of our late leaders we found ourself constrained to exclaim, ""O for one decade of a Ferdinand Lesseps!"" and we could not pay a higher compliment to Sir Samuel than to express the hope and belief that his administration of the Gold Coast Colony will prove that he possesses some of the characteristics of that distinguished man. The necessity of aiding by a judicious employment of British influence in arranging a termination of the dispute between the Egbas and Yorubas, which has so fearfully crippled the trade of Lagos, will, we feel assured, not only occupy his immediate attention, but stimulate him to efforts for bringing about that desirable result; nor do we think, judging by what he wisely did at Sierra Leone, that he will fail to do justice to the unfortunate holders of the demonetized Dollars who have hitherto in vain besieged the Executive with prayers for relief. We shall be much surprised, and grieved also, if he does not try what the ""Eucalyptus"" can do for improving the sanitary condition of the Coast towns and Lagos.

In his letter he tells us of some things we had not before heard. Mr Ussher seems by his report to have been in great pain shortly preceding his death, for the letter says, “He was heard, hard by the Castle, growling from the effects of his disease, and at death he was buried in a plain-dressed (unfurnished) coffin, and had the ill-fortune to be interred without the reading of the burial service.” Now this, if true, is, we think, a just cause of deep reproach to the other officials at Accra. What! could not one of them exert himself to obtain the assistance of a missionary, or himself read the beautiful service appointed by the Established Protestant Church? We could scarcely have believed it possible for British officials, under any circumstances, thus to fail in the last token of respect for a late chief, whom but a few hours before they may have been ready too obsequiously to serve. Our correspondent does not say that there is any necessary connection with the above and his letter, but it seems to us that there was a connection in his mind between the two statements. He says, “To this may be added that during his lifetime he was often seen on Sundays with his rifle over his shoulder going hunting or sporting, in utter disregard of the duties of the Sabbath.” Although, perhaps, there are not other high officials of the British Government on the West Coast who would thus show the “utter disregard” thus attributed to the late Governor Ussher, we have thought it well to print these observations that they may see how such conduct, when it does occur, is noted and commented upon by the Africans, who have been educated in the Missionary Schools, and who are taught to look upon the British as a Christian Government, and upon British Government officials as representing in Africa a British community one of the great characteristics of which is an abstention on the first day of the week from all ordinary secular amusements and employments, except where circumstances may make the latter absolutely necessary. And we cannot refrain from expressing our deep regret that any British Government officials on the West Coast should set such an example as is thus attributed to the late Governor Ussher. As representing such a community as that of Great Britain, we certainly think it their duty to “affect a virtue even though they have it not.” It is true we cannot charge the British Government with having done much to promote education among the West African people, and therefore cannot accuse them of imparting a mere secular education which in Africa, we are quite sure, would produce most baneful effects, as affording a people whom it is proposed to release from the sway of the most debasing, degrading superstitions, increased means for the perpetration of evil, without bringing them under the really civilizing restraint of those higher principles of human action which the blessed doctrines and precepts of Christianity inculcate for the guidance of responsible human beings in their intercourse with each other. But we would suggest, for the consideration of Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, the propriety (as it seems, if what this correspondent reports be true, there is a necessity) of laying it down as a rule for Government officials in the British settlements on the West Coast that they shall not by their conduct neutralize the teaching of the Protestant missionaries, to whom the African people are indebted for all the education they have received. What we desire for Africa, and what ought to be at least desired for her by the British Government, is not only that she shall advance in civilization, but that the civilization in which she advances shall be a Christian one; and we do not think we ask too much of a Secretary of State for the Colonies in asking him to lay down such rules as we have above mentioned for the conduct of British officials holding appointments under the Crown in West Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1881#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}]",True

Similarly, Henry Christy is recognized for his philanthropic and scientific contributions, including his involvement with the African-Aid Society and his archaeological work, which aimed to establish the common origin and unity of the human race.

When they re-entered their own worlds, many felt driven to resolve questions of ideology, cultural definition, educational values, political power, and pan-African unity or consciousness, guided by new perspectives.\nViewed against such an historical backdrop, the numerous pan-African conferences, Tuskegean educational and technical projects, the nØgritude movement and the occasional focus on American blacks in African millen› nial dreams, all illustrate the consistency of the pan-African theme among American and Caribbean blacks.

The Society would sell shares or land rights offered by African petitioners but only to Afro-American or African purchasers. 4 Bishop Turner also later served as an adviser to the International Migration Society (IMS) of Alabama, which sent about 500 emigrants to Africa before it became defunct in 1900. Some of the 500 remained in Liberia; others returned to the United States. Those who remained fared reasonably well; evidently more than a few of them prospered. On the other hand, those who returned told horror stories of poor land, inadequate food and poor living conditions. These stories reduced the likelihood of any large-scale Afro-American emigration movement, even though prospects for blacks in the United States were declining from 1895 to 1900. Nevertheless, numerous Afro-Americans evidently continued to give serious consider› ation to African emigration, just as others in the United States and the Caribbean simply moved away from overt discriminatory practices into other regions near by.\nAfter the turn of the twentieth century, the back-to-Africa baton was picked up by others. For example, one Captain Dean, early in the twentieth century, hoped to engineer the settlement of American blacks in South Africa to fashion a powerful black state there. After the briefest sojourn meant to arrange for this settlement, however, white authorities expelled Dean from the Cape for what were termed 'provocative activities'. And in 1914, Chief Alfred C. Sam, a Gold Coast African, turned up in Oklahoma, persuaded about sixty black farmers that Africa offered them greater oppor› tunities and sailed with them to Saltpond in the Gold Coast. Finding Chief Sam's claims to be exaggerated and encountering restrictions from the Gold Coast officials which inhibited the entry of American immigrants, most of the Oklahomans eventually returned to the United States.

The other races have countries of their own and it is time for the 400,000,000 Negroes [of the world] to claim Africa for themselves. 55 Whereas Du Bois was a greater pan-African force among black intellectuals outside Africa, and Washington was better known among rural artisan classes, Garvey's influence fell equally upon the submerged black masses of all strata both outside and inside Africa. Garvey received much of his own pan-Africanist inspiration from the Egyptian intellectual, Duse Muhammad Ali, while in England in 1912 and from reading, also in London, Washington's autobiography, Up From Slavery.\nInitially organized around the idea of setting up a Tuskegee-type school in Jamaica, Garvey's UNIA became the organizational link between large numbers of Africans and American blacks outside Africa, and, through The Negro World, achieved substantial pan-African effect within Africa. Between 1920 and 1938, eight UNIA conventions were held. The first five, with Garvey in charge, were held in New York City in August of each year from 1920 to 1924, the next two, following Garvey's deportation from the United States, took place in Jamaica in 1929 and 1934, and the eighth and last, in Canada, in 1938."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 610, 'article_title': 'DEATH OF HENRY CHRISTY, ESQ.', 'full_section_title': 'DEATH OF HENRY CHRISTY, ESQ.', 'last_edit_date': '05-23-1865', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1865#article-18', 'issue_date': '23_05_1865', 'content': 'The African-Aid Society has again to deplore the loss by death of one of the active and energetic members of its Council, and one of its liberal supporters. The late Henry Christy, Esq., who died in France on Thursday, the 4th May, has left behind him loving memories of friends, and of those who have been delicately assisted by him in time of need. He was earnest in what he did, never undertaking anything lightly, nor ever lightly relinquishing what he had undertaken. He was a member of the Council of the African-Aid Society from May, 1861, and his lamented death leaves a blank that we can scarcely hope ever to see filled up. One by one the old and tried friends of Africa are removed from this scene of their labours, and the spirit which animated them is not found to descend upon any successor. There is, therefore, the greater need that the educated Africans on the Coast, who never had a more sincere friend than Mr. Henry Christy, should feel and fulfil the duty of organizing among themselves that pecuniary support for the society which he whose death we now lament, and a few noble kindred spirits, have ungrudgingly bestowed. Nothing connected with the society seemed to give him greater pleasure than to hear that they were gradually awakening, under the impulse given by the African Times, to a sense of their duty in this respect—and to perform that duty well, is the best tribute they can pay to the memory of one who deserves to be long honoured among them.\n\nThe following, which appeared in the Morning Star of the 6th inst., will make our readers to whom he did not happen to be personally known better acquainted with our deceased friend than anything we could ourselves add to the above brief notice:—'}, {'id': 610, 'article_title': 'DEATH OF HENRY CHRISTY, ESQ.', 'full_section_title': 'DEATH OF HENRY CHRISTY, ESQ.', 'last_edit_date': '05-23-1865', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1865#article-18', 'issue_date': '23_05_1865', 'content': ""We deeply regret to announce the death of Mr. Henry Christy, who was well known and highly-esteemed in the walks of philanthropy and science. For some years past he has devoted no small share of his time and fortune to the personal exploration of the Pyrenees, and of other parts of the Continent where the discovery of flint implements has thrown so strange a light upon the early history of mankind. His later researches, which were undertaken in conjunction with the distinguished French savant M. Lartet, have proved of the greatest value to science; and he prosecuted them with the more ardour because he believed that they would tend to establish the common origin and essential unity of the human race. Last year he disentombed some implements which proved the existence among the earliest inhabitants of the globe of the elements of artistic design—rude, it may be, but still exhibiting a capacity for improvement. He died on Thursday afternoon at La Palisse, Department de L'Allier, where he was stopped by illness when on his way from the field of his interesting labours towards Switzerland. He was at the time travelling with his attached friend and fellow-labourer, M. Lartet, whose wife was also of the party. An eminent physician from Paris was summoned without delay; but every effort to arrest the disease—which was inflammation of the lungs—proved unavailing, and he died shortly after the arrival of his brother, who had hastened to the scene. The late Mr. Christy was in his fifty-sixth year, and in the prime and vigour of manhood. His life was consecrated to works of beneficence. During the Irish famine he devoted himself personally to the mitigation of the disease and suffering which had awakened his benevolent sympathy, and his own life nearly fell a sacrifice to his efforts in this good cause. He was a man of singularly varied endowments, and took as much pleasure in dispensing knowledge as he did in its acquisition. There were few parts of the world which he had not visited, some of them again and again; and the Arabs of Algeria, the negroes of Western Africa and America, the Indians of the British North American colonies, and the oppressed in Syria, have reason to bless him as a benefactor no less than the poor of his own country. He was a man who sought not fame; he loved to do good by stealth; and those who knew him, and many who never saw his face, will ever cherish his memory.""}, {'id': 1947, 'article_title': 'The Good Black Doctor: Dr. Davis', 'full_section_title': 'The Good Black Doctor: Dr. Davis', 'last_edit_date': '11-30-1870', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1870#article-9', 'issue_date': '23_12_1870', 'content': '**THE GOOD BLACK DOCTOR: DR.

Dr. Davis\'s death will be felt as an irreparable loss, for in him the highest enthusiasm for the cause in which he was engaged was combined with great scientific attainments. Dr. Davis had but just returned from a ten days\' visit to England, during which he had worked so hard in soliciting aid for his poor people, and travelled so continuously, that he was quite worn out when he got back to Pont Maugny. In spite of his fatigue, Dr. Davis insisted on visiting the Military Hospital at Sedan, where, going through the smallpox ward, he caught, as is supposed, the disease which carried him off. During those trying weeks which followed the battle of Sedan, Dr. Davis devoted himself to the care of several hundred wounded Bavarians, whom he found in the direst need of medical aid and proper nourishment. Out of the funds entrusted to him by a few friends he entirely supported his ambulance, where—if my memory does not fail me—on taking the management upon himself, he found nothing but a bottle of brandy and two lemons. Even before his wounded Bavarians were off his hands, Dr. Davis formed, and actually carried out, the project of establishing soup-kitchens at Pont Maugny and Balan, in behalf of the peasantry, of whose extreme want he was aware.""\n\npainfully aware. For he was assailed on all sides by the poor, who came daily in so distressed and emaciated a condition to consult him, that he decided that nourishing soup was the best medicine to prescribe for the majority. Finding during Dr. Davis\'s illness that these soup-kitchens were much in want of funds, with the probability of their beneficent operations being speedily arrested, I did not hesitate to subsidise them to the extent of 200l. on Friday last, for which sum Mr. Hugman (Dr. Davis\'s assistant) gave me an acknowledgment.'}, {'id': 1947, 'article_title': 'The Good Black Doctor: Dr. Davis', 'full_section_title': 'The Good Black Doctor: Dr. Davis', 'last_edit_date': '11-30-1870', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1870#article-9', 'issue_date': '23_12_1870', 'content': '""So keen was Dr. Davis about his soup-kitchens that a short time ago, when Miss Gulden told him that there was not sufficient soup for all the applicants, he took the watch out of his pocket, which he had gained as a prize at college, declaring that he would rather sell even that than suffer any to go away without soup. The University of Aberdeen, where Dr. Davis took his degree of M.D., may well be proud of him, and Barbadoes, where he was born, will hand down his name to posterity as a bright example.\n\n""Dr. Davis\'s memory will live in many hearts and in several lands, under various skies, but nowhere will it be more treasured than in the villages about Pont Mangy, whence for years to come, one may venture to prophecy, pilgrimages will be made to the grave of \'the good negro doctor,\' in the quiet nook at Fond de Giroune, where he was laid yesterday. To that grave he was followed by a long stream of sorrowing peasantry, a most touching and eloquent tribute to the memory of him whose devotion to them had cost Dr. Davis his life in the flower of his youth. There were not many dry eyes when M. Philipoteau, the Mayor of Sedan, concluded his address by the following words: \'Must it not be that God recompenses those who, like you, fall victims to their charity and devotion? Have we not the right to affirm to this numerous assembly, that, dying at the age of twenty-eight for the love of your kind, you have found there on high a bright immortality? May our ravaged districts not be long in finding a worthy successor of the good works of him who was known to us as ""Le Bon Docteur Noir!""

He was a native of Barbadoes, and, with the exception of a short term of residence at Aberdeen, where he graduated in medicine, he prosecuted his studies at St. Bartholomew\'s, of which hospital the energy and intelligence with which he worked, and his strongly-pronounced religious opinions, made him a conspicuous student. In October last he resigned the house-physicianship at that hospital, to give his services to the suffering peasantry in the neighbourhood of Sedan, and, armed with funds which had been entrusted to him by some friends in England, he devoted himself with remarkable skill and energy to the treatment of large numbers of sick and wounded, and to the establishment of soup-kitchens at Balan and Pont Mangy, which have given food and life to hundreds of starving peasants. But his enthusiasm carried him beyond his strength, and returning in an exhausted condition from a short visit to England, where he had been to seek further funds, he was attacked with small-pox, of which he died the 27th of November, at the age of twenty-eight, but not before he had accomplished a noble work, and earned the gratitude of hundreds who owe their lives to his self-sacrifice.

Within the years 1889-90 he was offered, and undertook awhile, the editorship of the *Iwe Irohin Eko*, an Anglo-vernacular organ which circulated in the Colony and in the interior. In 1890 he became editor of *The Lagos Times*, the most influential local paper in the Colony, receiving much courtesy from the proprietor and his wife. In 1891 he became identified with, inspired and strengthened, the U. N. A. Church, an organisation attempting to solve the difficult problem of a non-sectarian African church government, designing and publishing in its interest a sheet almanack in the language spoken by the people. In 1892 he acted as editor for *The Lagos Weekly Record*, the present leading weekly paper in the Colony of Lagos, during the absence of its proprietor and editor, Mr. J. P. Jackson, in this country and in France. Withdrawing from the new organisation mentioned, he went on a visit to the Republic of Liberia and the Colony of Sierra Leone, making important observations touching the destiny of his race, which observations he embodied in two lectures given at Lagos on his return. He was accorded unusual welcome at both places, and was ordained by the laying-on of hands at the Republic of Liberia. He took up his original and Native names, and his African costume shortly after. The expense of this voyage was borne by two young traders, Natives of the Colony of Lagos, Messrs. J. W. and B. C. Vaughan. He returned to Lagos at the close of 1894 as pastor of Ebenezer Church, the congregation with which he was formerly connected, and of which he was the leading spirit. Shortly after his return home he was greeted with the honorary degree of Master of Arts from the College of Liberia, and of Doctor of Philosophy from two colleges in the United States, for patriotism and literary ability. Among the early incidents concerning the subject of our sketch was that while he was but a little child he had a dog for his intimate companion, with whom he would always be ask to take his meals, and for whom he would wait when the hour for meals arrived. Another was that his father, in order to diminish the expenses of the table, often went a-hunting, and this child would often foretell whether the father would succeed in bringing home any game or not, and whether it would be bird or beast. Another was that he woke up one night greatly oppressed, and, on inquiry, related how he had dreamt a dream, in which he was seriously attacked by the Devil, who was beating him with a large club, and he found no way of escape until an angel appeared and took away the club from the Devil, and drove him away. His first earthly reward for bringing men to the Saviour he considered to have happened when, on one occasion, he brought to a Sunday-school, of which he himself was a scholar, half-a-dozen new scholars, his street playmates, and the superintendent of the Sunday-school, was so struck with the act that, finding no other thing near at hand, he made him a present of a sixpenny coin. During his career in the elementary schools of the Colony he seldom had books. He had no means to purchase any, and his parents were poor; he had often to depend on the books of more favoured pupils, and yet he invariably earned the respect and confidence of his teachers. Dr. Agbebi is, as already observed, wholly a production of the Colony of Lagos, and is interested in all that concerns the spiritual, social, religious, political, and intellectual welfare of his race. On the eve of his departure to this country a farewell address and the sum of twenty-one guineas were presented to him in the name of the community of Lagos. He was not educated out of Africa, and is regarded as a most remarkable and creditable specimen of the African trained in Africa. He believes in the planting of independent churches, and in industrial evangelisation; and in the prosecution of his ideas he has come over to England, through the courtesy of Messrs. Elder, Dempster & Co., and the Rev. W. Hughes, of Wales, to speak to the appreciation and welfare of the African Institute at Colwyn Bay, founded on industrial lines for the training of African youths, as well as to create sympathy for his work in Yoruba Land. Dr. Agbebi, from his contact with various Christian bodies, has become, in a great degree, a liberal-minded, practical, earnest Christian worker. His hymns have a place in the Yoruba Church Missionary Hymn Book, and he is willing to co-operate in any good work. He was held in high esteem by the late Catholic Bishop of Lagos, who once engaged and paid him liberally for literary work; and he has been in friendly relations with the Right Rev. H. Tugwell and his coadjutors, bishops in Western Equatorial Africa, to whom he expresses himself indebted for much personal kindness, and no less is he at peace with the agents of the Wesleyan mission, and boasts the possession of a good wife, and is the father of several children. The West African press has spoken of him at various times as a ""seer,"" ""poet,"" ""reformer,"" ""patriot,"" ""prophet,"" ""author,"" ""genius,"" ""religionist."" He attended the Keswick Convention, and came in contact with the cream of English Christianity, and was to have been present at the recent International Geographical Congress but for unforeseen circumstances. Dr. Agbebi has met with many friends, and is returning to Africa with favourable impressions. He has had many difficulties to contend with, and many trials to suffer, and yet is ever pursuing a higher ideal. He keeps continually looking up. We may add that he gave a lecture on the 16th inst. to the German Young Men\'s Christian Association, at Finsbury Park Square, on ""Christianity in Africa,"" at which nine other missionaries and a large and attentive audience were present. — *Colonies & India.*'}]","[{'document_title': 'SURGEONS FOR THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Sir,—I am sure you will insert a few words on a subject of great importance with us, and allow me to commence by asking, Who in Jamaica are your learned men of the law?

It has been a cause of great satisfaction to us to receive the above donations from M'Carthy's Island; and these, too, spontaneously collected by Dr. Horton before our remarks of last month had reached the Gambia. It is an encouraging fact that, with one or two exceptions, such as the Commandant, &c., all the contributors are Africans. We cannot too strongly urge upon the Africans in every part of West Africa to which this journal penetrates, that all our efforts are directed to procuring for them increased facilities and protection—for advancing their interests and the Christian civilization of their native countries. Doctor Horton suggests in his letter that the Africans on the Coast ought to contribute the 200l. a-year which the Society requires in order to give it sufficient freedom of action. If all the native traders down the Coast would make it a personal affair; if every one would for himself determine to be an annual subscriber of, say, only one guinea to the Society, and to send this subscription forward regularly, we should indeed feel stimulated anew, and powerfully stimulated, to increased exertions for them. It will be a proud day for us when we can say to the English friends of Africa, as well as to the revilers of Africa, that the African-Aid Society has an African list of subscribers, whose annual contributions render it independent of lukewarm European sympathies. Such a position would greatly strengthen our hands, both with the British Government and the British public. It will do much for us to be able to show them an educated Africa, keenly alive to its responsibilities towards those from among whom they have been brought out by the education they have received—fully alive to the necessity of those ameliorations of Government system, and those increased facilities for the development of African resources, for which we, in their interest, have ever been contending.

One of the two only of native Africans who have been educated for Government Medical Service, Dr. Horton, as a Staff Assistant Surgeon, has passed eight years at the different British settlements on the West Coast.

In our position as regards West Africa we think it necessary to state this at once, that we may not be misunderstood.

J. McNabb, for a trip of a few weeks’ recreation and inspection. This left me in charge of the Mission, with Miss Dabney and Mr. Christian Schmidt to aid.\n\nThere were 107 large sacks of rice on the Cardenas, for the famine sufferers, and nine from England, having been forwarded by two Baltimore friends, making 116 in all. This I gave out in twenty-one different lots, to as many kings or heads of towns or families (i.e., Patriarchs), keeping sixteen sacks to deal out to needy and suffering individual cases, of which there are a great number, and some very sad. I have my fears that some of the head men and kings will take the lion’s share for themselves; but we must trust them, as it is the only way to reach the mass of the people, and the best channel for distribution that heathenism offers, bad though it be. But, despite all the drawbacks and disadvantages, this donation of rice has done more good than can ever be estimated here on earth. It has preached Christ, as a great ennobling motive power in man’s heart, and set the heathen at work to contemplate this new thing of men doing such deeds from such motives. The fact is what they must account for, and it stands out separate and distinct from all other motives they see. Our sufferings here for them they compare at once with those of the trader who is here for money; they say we are paid to come as well as the trader. They put our gratuitous boarding, teaching, and clothing their children on the same footing as if they let us have them to carry water or wood, or do any menial service. When they give a child to the most degraded servitude of the most ignorant child of civilization, it is generally done with the phrase, “I give you my boy to learn book,” and this often when the receiver does not know the letters of the alphabet. So to the illiterate heathen the plea of educating his child stands on a par with making him a hewer of wood and drawer of water, and he always considers you a little in his debt for the service of his son. If you do not choose to make him work, that is your fault (in his eyes). So, looked at from the heathen man’s standpoint, missions are in his debt.

The African-Aid Society acts, therefore, as the pioneer of Christian missions, in its endeavours to remove those exceptional obstacles, which not only add very much to the expense of those missions, and to the privations and dangers of the devoted missionaries, but limit also the extension of those missions, and retard their great work of the proclamation of the glad tidings of salvation, the acceptance of which can alone remove the bleeding woes of Africa. We feel that the African-Aid Society cannot have a more glorious title than that of ""THE PIONEER OF CHRISTIAN MISSIONS AND OF CIVILISING COMMERCE."" It is in this capacity of pioneer that the efforts of the society have been so much directed toward the Gambia and the Sherboro countries, and toward our Gold Coast possessions, Dahomey, and the districts in which the great river Niger presents a path for missionary and commercial action. It is as a ""pioneer"" that it waits, and watches, and acts (so far as circumstances will permit) for the removal or modification of those deep curses to Eastern Africa, the Portuguese rule from Delagoa Bay to the territories of Zanzibar, and the connivance of the Sultan of the latter, for pecuniary considerations, at that devastating slave-trade carried on by the Arabs with the Persian Gulf. What a field of arduous labour is here presented to the Christian view—is here placed before the philanthropist, the statesman, and the merchant. And are we not justified in saying that it is a disgrace to a Christian and enlightened country and people—a country and a people whom God has specially entrusted with the work of the spread of the Gospel of Christ and of true civilization among the nations—that such a work should languish for want of a very moderate degree of encouragement and support? Is it surprising that we should have echoed the complaint and the appeal of the Archbishop of York—that we, who feel ourselves highly honoured and greatly privileged by God in being permitted to give a portion of our most earnest energies to this ""pioneer"" work for Him, and for those whom He has made of one blood with us (though so differing in colour and other accidents), should lament the apathy which hinders us, and remind our fellow-subjects of that great duty which especially devolves upon them and upon us, as the descendants of those who for so many years perpetrated and permitted the African slave-trade,\nPage 65', 'last_edit_date': '1864-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1864#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MR.
