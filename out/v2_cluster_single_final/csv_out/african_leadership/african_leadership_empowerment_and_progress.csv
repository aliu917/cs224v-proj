269,"Post-independence African nations have actively pursued economic development and political stability, achieving notable progress despite historical adversities.","The examination of post-independence African nations' pursuit of economic development and political stability reveals a complex narrative, as highlighted by both the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook provides a nuanced view, acknowledging the significant challenges posed by the artificial colonial boundaries that created states with unequal resources and economic potential, as well as the persistence of monocrop economies and exploitative integration into the world economy. Despite these adversities, the text notes the establishment of new political structures and institutions, such as judicial systems and bureaucracies, which have been maintained post-independence and could contribute to political stability. It also emphasizes the resilience and adaptability of African societies and the efforts of indigenous elites to embrace change and modernization. While the textbook does not explicitly state that African nations have achieved notable progress, it suggests ongoing efforts towards development and stability. In contrast, The African Times articles focus on the colonial period, detailing the economic activities and political maneuvers of European powers, such as the establishment of trade, suppression of the slave trade, and infrastructure development, without addressing the post-independence era. This lack of information on post-independence progress highlights a gap in the articles, which do not provide evidence to support or refute the claim regarding African nations' efforts and achievements after gaining independence. Together, these sources present a complex picture that both aligns with and challenges the claim, emphasizing ongoing struggles and efforts rather than unequivocal success.","The ""General History of Africa"" textbook provides a nuanced view of the post-independence challenges and developments in African nations, which both supports and complicates the claim that these nations have actively pursued economic development and political stability.

While Sudan and Zaire have areas of 2.5 million sq km and 2.4 million sq km respectively, the area of The Gambia is only 10350 sq km, that of Lesotho 29 200 sq km and that of Burundi 28 800 sq km.

There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years. The importance of this particular legacy varied from one colonial system to the other.

Furthermore states were constructed in this same era which were quite remote from the world-economy as, for example, the Rozvi.$^{35}$ Also it is quite obvious, by looking at the West African states, that there is an imperfect connection between participation in the slave-trade and state-formation. If the two went hand to hand for Dahomey and Oyo, in Benin we had the formation of a strong state without such participation, and the inverse was true for the Niger delta. 36 The point, however, is a different one. It is that involvement in the world-economy required political structures that ensured the functioning of the economy; its commerce, its production, its labour-force supply.\nThe outside pressure was to have such structures.$^{37}$ Where the existing structures performed the necessary functions, for whatever reason, there was little pressure to change them. But, of course, the involvement in the world-economy increased the economic importance to given internal producers of sympathetic political structures. It is the internal producers who pressed to change the structures.$^{38}$ This led to various kinds of turmoil, which were of limited benefit to other participants in the world-economy. The latter in turn pressed for political stabilization, which took the form of creating states which participated in and were therefore constrained by the interstate system.$^{39}$ Ultimately, as we know, this led in most of Africa to the creation of colonial states. The abolition of the slave trade was a crucial political and economic event in this process. As plantation slavery and the slave trade were phenomena deriving from the operation of the capitalist world-economy, so was the abolition of the slave trade and of plantation slavery. I do not wish here to re-open the question of the importance of the abolitionists as a pressure group in this process. They of course existed and were part of the process. But the fact that such a pressure group existed and played a role in the process is not an explanation of the process but one of the aspects of it that needs to be explained.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.607, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': 'The outcome of the Scramble and partition for Liberia and Ethiopia', 'content': 'The European Scramble for and partition of Africa did have some interest› ing but contrasting impacts on Liberia and Ethiopia. For one thing, they were the only two states in the whole of the continent that survived the imperialist onslaught and retained their sovereignty and independence.

To all this must be added, in the case of Ethiopia, her military strength. On the other hand, Ethiopia gained further territories while Liberia lost part of hers mainly because of the internal conditions - political, economic and military - in each of the states and of course the degree of the interference of the Europeans in these internal affairs.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.59, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""The first positive political impact was the establishment of a greater degree of continuous peace and stability following the consolidation of colonialism in Africa than before.

Though, as both A. E. Afigbo and G. N. Uzoigwe have shown (Chapters 2 and 19), the boundaries of the states that emerged were not as arbitrary as is generally believed, there is no doubt that many of the states that emerged were artificial creations, and this artificiality has created a number of problems that are bound to bedevil the future development of the continent. The first of these is the fact that some of these boundaries cut across pre-existing ethnic groups, states and kingdoms and this has caused widespread social disruption and displace› ment. The Bakongo are, for instance, found divided by the boundaries of Angola, Belgian Congo (now Zaire), French Congo (now Congo) and Gabon. Today, some of the Ewe live in Ghana, some in Togo and some in Benin; the Somali are shared among Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti; the Senufo are found in Mali, Ivory Coast and Upper Volta. The examples can be multiplied. One important consequence of this situation has been the chronic border disputes that have plagued the relations between some independent African states - such as those between Sudan and Uganda; between Somalia and Ethiopia; between Kenya and Somalia; between Ghana and Togo; and between Nigeria and Cameroon. Secondly, because of the arbitrary nature of these boundaries, each African nation-state is made up of a medley of peoples with different cultures, traditions of origin and language.

One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

Exploration of the ideological basis of resistance gains a new richness when we add the first manifestations of 'consciousness' on the part of workers or peasants to the idea of sovereignty and to the search for a new moral order.

In the Colony of Lagos these evidences of advancement are very conspicuous, and they are clearly set forth in a local newspaper conducted by an intelligent Native—*The Lagos Record*.

Her Chamber of Deputies has granted the De Brazza mission, by a vote of 449 to 3, a credit of a million and a quarter of francs. The Portuguese Government has appointed explorers and examined the Congo country, and assumes to exercise control over all the territory at the mouth of the Congo. The German Reichstag has increased its annual appropriation for the exploration of Africa. Italy has despatched a party to Abyssinia for geographical and mercantile purposes. She has also concluded treaties which promise to make Assab a centre of commerce. The Sultan of Morocco has authorized Spain to take possession of Santa Cruz del Mar, and the Sultan of Zanzibar has purchased six superior steamers to constitute a regular coast service, in the interest of commerce and for the suppression of the slave-trade. The International African Association, which owes its origin to the philanthropic initiative of Leopold II., King of the Belgians, has received large subscriptions and pushed forward exploring expeditions to start and equip the line of hospitable and scientific stations which are to bound the East and West Coast, and form a civilizing girdle around Central Africa. And the results following the explorations of Livingstone and Stanley and De Brazza are attracting the attention of the civilized world. What was a \'Dark Continent,\' by the indomitable energy of these explorers, seems likely to prove the richest quarter of the globe. Not only does the land produce, with slight persuasion of tillage, admirable crops of cotton and coffee, but the soil is rich in diamonds on its southern coast, and in iron on its northern.

Boma and Matadi up the Congo, to which ports vessels from Liverpool are now plying direct, are becoming the chief ports from which produce is being shipped, and the facilities at these places are gradually drawing the ivory trade away from Zanzibar. On the upper reaches of the Congo, Tipoo Tib, who up till quite recently has been held up to execration as a slave-hunter, is now diverting the ivory which hitherto carried by slaves, was taken to Zanzibar and other ports on the East Coast. The Congo State has now its officials at the very spot where the Arabs collect the ivory. Instead of making raids on villages and killing hundreds of natives to obtain slaves to carry the ivory to the East Coast, the Arabs can now sell it to the Congo Free State at Stanley Falls, where a regular ivory market at present exists. The Arabs not requiring carriers have no need of slaves except for domestic purposes, and the terrible traffic is said to be gradually dying out. The road from the Upper Congo at Niangwe and from the Tanganika to the East Coast is a difficult one, and often ivory carried by slaves took one or two years to reach the coast by that route. In the neighbourhood of Stanley Falls the former slave-dealers are forcing themselves into a peaceful colony under Tipoo Tib, who has himself discarded his old slave raids and is employing his energies in ruling the people. It is the belief that the Tanganika-Zanzibar route will ere long be entirely superseded by the Congo route. This is the tendency at present, and when the Congo railway is completed the Congo route will be more availed of. Matadi can be reached by ocean steamers, and from Matadi, which is at the foot of the cataracts, the railway will start. Belgian, French, and Dutch houses are now established at Stanley Pool and are buying the ivory, which formerly found its way by caravans to the Angola Coast.\n\nA magnificent river, running parallel with and to the west of the Congo, has lately been discovered. The river, the Lomami by name, was found easily navigable and with a good depth. The Lomami will allow of the navigable Congo system being brought into direct communication with Niangwe, the chief Arab settlement on the High Congo, the Uangolle Lomami being only at a distance of three days' march from that town. The communication between Niangwe and Stanley Falls by the Congo is almost impossible, owing to the many falls and rapids; and the Lomami will form a further means of extending protection and bringing civilisation to regions which have suffered much from the Arab raids for slaves."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.56, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FREE STATE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The rescue of Central Africa from barbarism, and the formation of a Free State in which men of all nationalities can trade without exclusive privilege to any, is one of the grandest efforts of modern times.

Only by the basin of the Amazon is the basin of the Congo rivalled in point of fertility and extent. Exploration, which is rapidly penetrating into the recesses of the Dark Continent, has just shown two tributaries only second in importance to the main stream, and equally navigable—the Welle, which was supposed to fall into Lake Tsad, and the Oubangi. The Kasai, which falls into the Congo on the left bank at Kwamuth, has now been navigated far into the interior of the country, and a station is projected four or five hundred miles from the confluence of the two streams on a tributary of the Kasai. The waters of these and other rivers flowing into the Congo drain a territory, peopled by a vigorous, peaceful race, with aptitude for civilization, and in a condition far above savagery. Mahometanism, which places the lower races hopelessly beyond the pale of European morals, has only reached the northern extremity of the new State, and the great bulk of the native communities is still free to adopt Christianity.

Except that both undertakings sprang from a common spirit of commercial enterprise, the comparison is deceptive and misleading. The East India Company planted itself in countries already occupied by old civilisations, where the national intellect had been cultivated for untold ages, and commerce, with its attendant wealth, had long flourished; countries peopled by races inured to taxation, from whom large revenues could be raised without serious opposition. On the Niger there is no Pagoda-tree to be shaken with the accompanying showers of rupees. We do not, so far, raise from the natives one penny of direct revenue, the little we receive being indirectly through duties on the trade entering and leaving the country. Instead of vast populations with the inherited habit of labour, we have to deal for the most part with tribes ignorant, idle, and improvident, incapable of understanding, I need hardly say, not only the accumulation of wealth for future generations, but even the prudence of providing for their own sustenance during years of scarcity. They have not only to be taught how to work, but, what is more difficult, to be taught the habit of working.""\n\nWhile insisting on the potential wealth of Central Africa, I have dwelt on the obstacles in the way of its rapid development and on the absolute futility of an intermittent or spasmodic policy, because these points are essential to the main object of this article, which is to examine whether the existing movement in France is likely, within any period worth considering, to bring her settlements—for passing expeditions leave no results—into close contact and therefore possibly into collision with England in the Niger-Tchad basins. At the time of the conclusion of the late Anglo-French agreement, it was said that Lord Salisbury, far from having removed, *pro tanto*, the danger of conflict between the two nations, had given them a common frontier and had therefore actually created opportunities for disputes. I shall endeavour to show the fallacy of such reasoning by a short examination of the conditions which Lord Aberdare, in another speech delivered last July, summed up in the following words: ""Nature has placed between these spheres""—French and English—""formidable barriers, which could only be overcome by an initial expenditure out of all proportion to any probable returns for many years.""', 'last_edit_date': '1891-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1891#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.549, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Germans in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The latest mail from East Africa brings promising reports of the development of the German East African Company's territory. On the occasion of a tour of the manager, Mr. Vohsen, in company with Major Wissmann, in the northern coast towns, pacific negotiations took place with the native chiefs and treaties were concluded with a number of tribes for the cultivation of merchantable plants. On all hands evidence of returning confidence was afforded, and the towns are now becoming again peopled and building operations are being actively carried on. Dar-es-Salam, for example, the population of which had fallen to 350, now has 3,000 inhabitants. At Bagamoyo, all the large European firms have again settled down, and the town is coming forward with extraordinary rapidity. The trade of Tanga is steadily increasing. The German East African Company are constructing a large caravanserai at Bagamoyo to contain 5,000 persons, besides extensive warehouses, and large factories in several places. They hope thereby to make a considerable profit. In short, the reports are of such a character that the Company can look forward to the future with perfect confidence.\n\nA German trading factory will shortly be established at Tanga on the East African Coast, opposite the island of Pemba. A plantation is to be formed in connexion with the factory. Two persons have already been despatched to the scene of the Company's operations, a commercial representative and an agriculturist. Mr. Schiele, the commercial representative, has some acquaintance with the African trade, having been engaged in one of the Woermann factories for two years.\n\nA large collection of seeds was sent out at the same time, in addition to the ordinary articles of barter. As soon as the Company's representatives reach their destination, they will commence to plant vegetables and garden fruit trees. The plantation work will be started later.\n\nThe changes among the officials of the West African Protectorates, which were announced some months ago, have since taken place. On the departure of Freiherr von Soden, Governor of the Cameroons, on leave of absence, the administration of the protectorate was assumed by Mr. Zimmerer, Imperial Commissioner in the Togo Territory, whilst Mr. von Puttkamer, Imperial German Consul at Lagos, is representing Mr. Zimmerer on the Slave Coast.

Germany undertook the management of the first great African Conference, and thereby secured an equal share with the older naval powers in the opening up of the Dark Continent. She attained her object by means of a number of annexations, at various points on the coast, quickly following one another; and the territory thus acquired was scarcely behind that appropriated by England and France at the same time. ""Yet the fact is not to be denied,"" says Kuhlow\'s, ""that in our most important possessions the gravest difficulties have risen almost at the same time, and we as beginners in such matters did not forthwith find a way out of these complications, and the effect has been to somewhat damage our reputation as a colonial power. . . .

Only at the end of last year the German nation expressed its will in regard to the re-conquest of German territory in East Africa. The Government and the Reichstag joined in with this movement, and the work was skilfully and forthwith undertaken. The enthusiasm and the pride of Germany have been excited by the victory of the Imperial Commissioner and the German fleet over the slave traders in Africa. It was the first German victory in a great engagement for the last eighteen years. Nevertheless there yet remains much to be done, especially in South-West Africa.

Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets. Ja Ja was made prisoner by Consul Johnstone, and carried off to Accra. An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river.

A man might now travel across the Continent from Sierra Leone to Cairo, or in another direction from Lagos to Tripoli, sleeping in a village every night, except in the Sahara, and in every village he would find a school."" The statements of Mr. Bosworth Smith are to the same effect. He says, ""At this day Mohammedan missionaries are meeting everywhere with a marked success which is denied our own.""

Similarly, in West Africa especially, where many indifferently educated Africans were able to interpose themselves as middlemen between the primary producers and the big European commercial companies, commercial success also provided a ready passport to the new elite status. There were, however, others who qualified for consideration as members of the elite because they controlled mass organizations like labour unions and could give the better-educated elite the kind of mass support which they needed to convince the colonial powers that they spoke for the people. On the contrary, in East and Central Africa relatively few Africans gained admission into the elite group as a result of the deliberate policies pursued by the colonial rulers and the activities of the Indians and Portuguese and Greek petty traders. In fact, in many of these areas, the old central elite virtually disappeared.\nIt is largely this wide variation in their qualifications and background that makes it so difficult to define precisely in those terms who were the new elite of colonial Africa. One can thus justifiably argue that the issue of the rise of a new elite among any African people in the colonial era was largely a question of what amount and kind of educational and economic opportunities were available to the people and how far they put those opportunities to effective use. All the studies so far carried out on this aspect of the matter suggest that regions or colonies which witnessed the most intensive efforts in the propagation of western education and which offered Africans more opportunities for meaningful participation in trade and commercial agriculture produced the largest number of people of elite status.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'The educational impact of the Americas', 'content': ""While travelling in West and Southern Africa with the Phelps-Stokes Commission and while lecturing in the Gold Coast as part of his Achimota appointment, Aggrey and several others in similar ways reached across many African communities and prompted dozens of African youth to seek an American rather than a British education.

Nor are they adequately explained in currently available scholarship. What appears to have occurred, particu› larly among Africans in British colonies, was an altered perspective of the American-educated African colliding with an inhospitable colonial reception (which was prompted by educational experiences completely outside the colonial orbit). 47 American education, however, was not universally or categorically opposed or disdained in the African colonies. Indications are that industrial or vocational training was welcomed by the colonial entrepreneur since it enabled him to secure well-trained artisans to drive motor lorries, build his houses, and manage his mechanical or electrical plant. Government officials and white missionaries encouraged this kind of training for different reasons: government officials because they believed that the commercial and economic development of the territory would be advanced, missionaries because they believed that Booker T.

The much-heralded black emigration schemes trumpeted by Garvey, whose ubiquitous publications reached deep into Africa, were only one example of a leitmotif which brought American blacks within the world view of African peoples. The themes of African redemption through American black missionaries were another.\nAfricans themselves, however, created the context of their next interaction with American blacks as they matriculated at American, largely Afro-American, schools and attended pan-African conferences and the like. Consequently, many Africans underwent a technical-educationalpolitical experience alien to their colonial world. When they re-entered their own worlds, many felt driven to resolve questions of ideology, cultural definition, educational values, political power, and pan-African unity or consciousness, guided by new perspectives.\nViewed against such an historical backdrop, the numerous pan-African conferences, Tuskegean educational and technical projects, the nØgritude movement and the occasional focus on American blacks in African millen› nial dreams, all illustrate the consistency of the pan-African theme among American and Caribbean blacks.

Another reflected the transformation of Africans from predicate to subject during the colonial period. The latter was a vision of the spiritual redemption, social recon› struction, and political reformation of African communities through the repatriation of African personnel and the energizing of African resources. Because of this vision, Africans had been educated in American schools, or sent to participate in technical and commercial activities; others were touched by American black writings or by anti-colonial ventures organized among blacks of the diaspora.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education.

The reputation and resources of Tuskegee, however, were brought to Africa by African and American alumni and, often, by numerous African visitors to Tuskegee or correspondents with Washington who had never been matriculated students. Consequently, through the media of numerous international conferences, visitations, and technical missions, many Africans were touched by the 'Tuskegee Spirit' or drew upon Tuskegee's and other American black resources."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Conclusions', 'content': ""What were the effects of colonial African and American black interaction? Only African populations of certain regions were initially involved in inter› action with American and Caribbean blacks. Those regions involved early in our period were the ones which became the focus of American black emigration or evangelism, particularly West Africa, South Africa, and the Horn. Peoples of other regions became involved because of the penetration of their region by pan-Africanist projects, American black writings, folk› lore, and the like, or more importantly, because of the initiatives of school leavers who went, in growing numbers from all over the African continent, to America for higher education.\nPerspectives were undoubtedly affected by direct and substantial inter› action of Africans within a particular black environment or set of influences. Exactly how much is anybody's guess. The effect of colonial African experience with American blacks appears, nevertheless, unique and vital in terms of subsequent social and political activities. For some, the American black component within African nationalist ideology and strategies emerging during the colonial period was striking and unequivocal. In the view of others, for example some African students, interactions within American black arenas were disappointing and unrewarding. The caustic assessment of one such visitor illustrates the latter point: 'One of the things I had decided to find out during my stay in America was the condition of the descendants of former slaves brought here from Africa ... I feel safe in saying that, so far as economic and material progress are concerned the Negro in America is on the average ahead of the West African, but when it comes to integrity and genuine manhood, the American Negro is far below him.' 75 Another view was that many Afro-American missionaries who viewed Africans as 'poor heathen savages' must bear some of the responsibility for perpetuating a distorted and pernicious picture of Africa and Africans in the minds of their fellow American blacks. In other words, in their sedulous campaign to recruit American black workers for foreign missions, missionary churches undoubtedly succumbed occasionally to the tempta- tion of portraying an exotic, erotic and socially inferior Africa much in need of great sacrifice, hard work, and alien redemption."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Black American evangelism in Africa', 'content': ""One of the means by which African-American black interchanges were nurtured in the colonial period, short of mass migrations, was the coming of black missionaries to 'elevate' Africa by Christian evangelism. In the main, evangelization took the form of American black missionaries working, first, in the service of mainstream, predominantly white denominations. For example, the Presbyterian Church sponsored black missionaries in French Cameroon as early as 1896. And the Reverend William H. Sheppard, a black graduate of Hampton Institute, Virginia, prodded the Southern Presbyterian Church into undertaking missionary work in the Congo in the 1890s, where he represented the Church and quickly found that his mission was attracting converts by 'the hundreds' and expanding 'until it was one of the most important stations of Christianity'.$^{26}$ Meanwhile, at the turn of the twentieth century, the Seventh-Day Adventists dispatched three black missionaries to Nyasaland (now Malawi), and as a result of a five-year tour sent three young African adherents, including Daniel Sharpe Malekebu, to the American black schools for education. (Not only were some of the 'white church' evangelists black, but some white mission› aries were placed in Afro-American schools to prepare for African service.)

African labour and taxes kept the railways viable and maintained colonial revenues. Yet, the African masses suffered most from the cutback on already skimpy social services, such as medicine and education, and they had to pay more for these services. In the years of recovery after 1934, wages, prices and facilities for Africans remained retrenched in contrast to the return to high profit levels for private capital.\nColonial governments granted minimum relief to Africans suffering from the depression. They suspended tax collection, and they subsidised prices, as the French did for groundnuts. They also tried to moderate the crudest forms of middleman exploitation. These measures arose out of necessity, since no money was circulating and since lower prices in one country forced desperate peasants to march long distances and smuggle their produce out through an area where there was some marginal advantage. As far as the middlemen were concerned, the governments needed to restrain them from cornering the reduced profit rather than let it be exported. However, in East Africa the 'Asian' merchants were essential for keeping the money economy intact and avoiding reversion to barter, just as their capital had been the original basis for the extension of specie and small-scale money exchanges throughout the region.$^{16}$ In the final analysis, therefore, the British administration co-operated to protect the interests of these retailers and produce buyers.

The roads inland must become something more than mere paths. There ought to be the commencement of River Conservancy Boards on a small scale, in order that the sand-bars, snags, and freshets of the Volta and the Prah should cease to be hindrances to the working of the coal fields on the former, and to ordinary commerce on the latter. Far more gold could be produced from the Gold Coast and Ashanti if proper modes of working were adopted. A railroad has been projected at Cape Coast Town, and such an undertaking, if consisting of a single line of rails only, either along the coast or towards the interior, would do much to abase barbaric power in Ashanti and Dahomi.

We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Mission Work in Africa, Africans Helping Themselves', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Rev.

A grant of 10,000 acres, situated near a civilised centre, is required as a basis. The land will be divided into ten sections of 1,000 acres each; and, upon each of these divisions, ten carefully selected and well-trained families will be located. A sum of £25,000 will be required to enable the settlers to hold out for the first three years, while adjusting themselves to their new habitat, and to pay for the land should it be found necessary to purchase it.\n\nDuring this period each head of a family would receive sufficient food and clothing for himself and his household, but would not be entitled to any further remuneration. At the beginning of the fourth year, however, an additional allowance of £30 per annum would, in like manner, be given, as it is hoped that by that time an income would be obtained from the land under cultivation. This arrangement would continue until the close of the tenth year, when the land would become the property of the people. The net proceeds of their earnings during this said period would be employed in the spread of civilisation among the Natives, and in the assisting of other enterprising Africans who were desirous of returning and settling down in their Fatherland.\n\nThe £25,000 necessary to float the scheme is not required at present. It will be raised with the help of a Committee\n\nwhen the proper time arrives. I purpose, first of all, to go, spy out, and secure the land; secondly, to proceed to the West Indies to select the first 100 families as pioneers.\n\nTo meet this preliminary expense and charges already incurred in connexion with the maturing and developing of the scheme, a sum of not less than £650 is required. About £300 of this moderate amount has already been subscribed by more than 200 highly representative friends, and further contributions are earnestly solicited from all who take an interest in the progress of the African race.\n\nSubscriptions can be sent to the Treasurers—Edward P.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'The educational impact of the Americas', 'content': 'When African students lived in America during the colonial period, they created the context for a different relationship between Africans and AfroAmericans and between African students themselves drawn from all over the African continent.

Secondly, the new classes created by colonialism and 'founded on western criteria of schooling and civilization, instead of on the African criteria of wealth and prestige'$^{57}$ are bound to remain and in fact increase in complexity. Already, two new groups have been added since independence. One is the political elite made up of the leading members of the political parties that have been mushrooming in Africa and who have become the prime ministers, presidents, ministers, ambassadors, etc. The other is the military elite made up of present and ex-officers of the armed forces of each independent state. The members of these elite groups are definitely different from the people of the rural areas in terms of their dress, life style, tastes and status. Now, had these elite groups constituted a good percentage of the population of Africa, one would have accepted their formation as yet another crucial and fundamental change introduced by colonialism. But as indicated already, the urban or elitist groups constituted by the end of the colonial era only a small fraction of the population, at most about 20%. The remaining people were the rural dwellers who remained predominantly illiterate and maintained their traditional beliefs, values and standards.

However, colonialism proved just as ephemeral as any other institution created and maintained by force. Within a matter of only some forty-five years from 1935, the colonial system had been uprooted from over 90% of Africa and confined only to that part of the continent south of the Limpopo River. That is to say, colonial› ism lasted in most parts of Africa for under a hundred years, indeed from the 1880s to the 1960s. In the history of a people and a whole continent, this is a very brief span indeed. How and why this incredible feat of the uprooting of colonialism was accomplished, or, to quote the words of Margery Perham, why this 'astonishingly rapid emancipation since 1950' ' form two of the main themes of the concluding volume of this History. In the concluding chapter of this volume, however, we would like to address ourselves to two main questions. First, what legacies did colonialism bequeath to Africa, or what impact did it make on Africa? The second question is, in view of this impact or balance sheet, what is the significance of colonialism for Africa? Does it constitute a revolutionary or important episode in the history of the continent? Was it a major break with the past of the continent, or was it, after all, a mere passing event which did not constitute a break in the history of the continent? Or as L. H. Gann and Peter Duignan have posed the same question, what is 'the place of the colonial era within the wider context of African history'? 2"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The significance of colonialism for Africa', 'content': ""This leads us on, then, to the second question posed at the beginning of the chapter, namely, the real significance of colonialism for Africa. Does it constitute a break with Africa's past or was it just a mere episode in its history, an episode which is of limited importance and which did not affect the course of African development? Here again, conflicting answers have been given to this question. To some historians, indeed a very large number, including the Marxist and the development and anti-development theorists but for very different reasons, though colonialism was a short interlude, it nevertheless was of great significance for Africa and left an indelible impression on Africa. As R. Oliver and N. Atmore contend: 'Measured on the time-scale of history, the colonial period was but an interlude of comparatively short duration. But it was an interlude that radically changed the direction and momentum of African history.'$^{50}$ Gann and Duignan also regard the colonial era 'as most decisive for the future of Africa'.$^{51}$ The answer of the Marxists and the underdevelopment theorists is neatly summed up in the title of Rodney's book, namely, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa. On the other hand, there are others who regard the colonial impact as skin-deep and that colonialism did not con› stitute any break with the African past. In a series of publications, 52 J. F. A. Ajayi has consistently maintained that the impact of colonialism on Africa has been exaggerated, that colonialism 'represents only an episode in a long and eventful history', and did not cause any break in continuity, that Africans retained some control over their own destinies and 'to the extent to which Africans retained initiative, the ability of Europeans to make entirely new departures in African history was limited'. Hopkins has also maintained that the 'colonial era has ceased to be regarded as the sole substance of African history and there are sound reasons for thinking that colonial rule itself had a less dramatic and a less pervasive economic impact than was once supposed'. He has insisted that colonial› ism did 'not create modernity out of backwardness by suddenly disrupting a traditional state of low-level equilibrium' and that 'the main function of the new rulers was to give impetus to a process of economic development which was already under way'. 53 To this author, there is really no simple yes or no answer to this question since the impact of colonialism"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in the face of partition and conquest', 'section_title': 'The periodization of resistance: the economic interpretation', 'content': ""I began this chapter by describing the situation in the last twenty years of the nineteenth century. Yet it has proved extremely difficult in practice to discuss resistance within this chronological limitation. At one extreme I have discussed Makana, the Xhosa prophet of the early nineteenth century. At the other extreme I have discussed the Zambezi rising of 1917 and its links with FRELIMO. But at least I have so far limited discussion to armed resistance to white invasion or to armed uprisings against colonial rule as it began to 'bite'; the chronological extensions arise from the uneven nature of white advance into Africa and from the still more uneven establish› ment of effective colonial control. Using this essentially political definition the period between 1880 and 1900 emerges as a crucial period of resistance, even if many of the great attempts to redefine sovereignty through protest took place later.\nIf we now turn in conclusion to the developing emphasis on economic resistance, the chronological limits become even less clearly defined. Perhaps the most radical reinterpretation is that of Samir Amin. Amin argues that the really crucial West African resistances to Europe came in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and he dismisses the resist› ances of the Scramble period itself as the half-hearted, rearguard actions of an already compromised ruling class. In Amin's eyes what was essentially at stake in the confrontation between Africa and Europe was not formal political control but Europe's attempts at economic manipulation. The truly significant African resistance was directed against such economic manipu› lation.\nAmin argues that the trade across the Sahara had 'strengthened state centralization and stimulated progress'. The European-controlled Atlantic trade, on the other hand, 'did not give rise to any productive forces: on the contrary, this caused a disintegration of society ... African societies obviously opposed this worsening of their situation, and Islam served as the basis for their resistance ... The Muslim priests tried to organize a resistance movement; their aim was to stop the slave trade, i.e. the export of the labour force, but not to end internal slavery ...

And again: ""Religion would be best promoted in the end by making industrial pursuits the first aim (not before religion, but before head knowledge) in point of importance.

The African-Aid Society and the African Times have never spoken out more strongly than this. Truth will make its way, in spite of prejudice and jealousy.

This country, blessed by nature with the possibilities of illimitable wealth, is cursed by an execrable and extortionate Government, under which all enterprise is forbidden, and the people are so ground down and oppressed that they say they do not care to plant even a palm tree, as they know they will never be allowed to eat of the fruit thereof. The people have all the life crushed out of them; and yet they are a patient, long-suffering race, and might be educated and trained to better things. The question may be asked, What has England done for Morocco? Sir John Drummond Hay, Her Majesty\'s Minister Plenipotentiary in Morocco, told me plainly that England had never done anything whatever for that country. . . . The prisons of Morocco are a disgrace, even to barbarians. The prisoners are not fed, much less clothed; and those poor wretches who have no friends to give them a morsel of bread simply die and are buried. . . . His Excellency was very frank in answering my questions as to the slave-trade, and the scandalous sales of slaves in the public streets. He admitted that these sales still go on, in spite of the protests from time to time issued by Her Majesty\'s Government. . . . One or two slender rays of light have lately gleamed across the dark background of Moorish misrule. The first which appeared was a relaxing of the rigid law that forbade all mining enterprise, or even the search for minerals, in which the country is known to be rich. In 1878, when Sir Joseph Hooker received a firman allowing him to explore the Atlas mountains, it was expressly stated that he was not to examine any stones or minerals. A few months ago the Emperor granted a concession to some English capitalists to search for coal, and it is hoped that this may be followed by a further concession to include other minerals. The operations have hitherto not resulted in anything very definite as regards coal. . . . Another hopeful sign in the approaching regeneration of Morocco is the establishment of two weekly journals, *Le Réveil de Maroc*, published in French, and *Al-moghreb Alaskra* (Anglicé, *The Far West*), published in Spanish. These two spirited little papers are ever ready to point out and denounce the many abuses that come before their notice.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Industrial Education in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Every month's experience justifies more and more the views of the African-Aid Society upon this question—views which they have only not carried into practical operation because, hitherto, there have been no funds for the work. To raise the industrial status of the African people, they must be taught those things which the civilised world has bit by bit acquired. Leave them to themselves, and they will never learn them. Why should they? They have not the same physical necessities that more northern people have. And physical necessity has been one of the great spurs to northern advancement. From a barbarism almost as degraded as that of the African, we have, under its impulse, gradually progressed to our present industrial, scientific, and social elevation. But there is no reason why the Africans should be condemned to a similar tortoise-like advance. The knowledge we have laboriously and tediously gained, in part from earlier civilizations, we could easily and rapidly impart, but it seems to have been almost the last thing thought of. In our anxiety to Christianise we have too much lost sight of the material aid that a spread of the arts, conveniences, and industrial facilities of civilization can bring to the inculcation of moral and religious truth. The African-Aid Society was formed that it might apply and urge the application of what was evidently so much needed. When it expressed its desire to conduct an emigration of coloured people from Canada and the United States to Africa, it was that it might introduce in their persons engineers, machinists, carpenters, blacksmiths, masons, cabinetmakers, brick and tile makers, trained agriculturists, millwrights, wheelwrights, coopers, waggon builders, road makers, &c., &c., &c. The progress of conviction as to the necessity of this has been slow in England. And this is not surprising, because it had not possessed the missionary mind in Africa. Any imaginable sum might be asked for religious missionary purposes in Africa, and it would be obtained. But ask for a small sum to teach the Africans the comforts and decencies, conveniences and industrial appliances of civilised life, and no national sentiment responded to the appeal. This is manifestly wrong. What we have freely received we ought freely to give. We, as a people, two thousand years ago had aid to help us out of our barbarism. The Britons were not left to imagine the utility of roads, and the advantage of clearings through forests: the Romans made roads and clearings for them. They were not left to imagine the advantage and comfort of solidly-constructed and comparatively commodious edifices: the Romans built towns and villages among them. And their work was not intended for mere temporary use alone. Substantial traces of it remain to this day. They are continually challenging our gratitude and admiration. And shall we not imitate in some degree the beneficial example? Shall we not strive to confer solid material benefits upon that Africa we so long assisted to rob of its most valuable possession—its human life; that we so long assisted to plunge deeper and deeper into the thick mire of barbarism, instead of helping her out of it? Our responsibilities toward Africa are far heavier than the public conscience has yet acknowledged. We know all the difference that exists between Great Britain now in Africa, and Rome formerly in Britain. Rome was laying the foundation for a permanent domination. We are not. Nationally, therefore, there is no analogy. But Rome had no such hideous debt of blood to Britain as we have to Africa. And we are Christian, not Pagan. We profess to be governed by higher principles than the Romans knew. We must, therefore, both as Government and people, do more than we have hitherto done for Africa. We must send her other teachers, as well as religious ones. We must establish centres of mechanical and other industry. The missionary mind in Africa is opening to this great truth. Missionaries are beginning to enunciate our principles.

It is greatly to be hoped that such an earnest appeal will not be suffered to pass by unheard. It is gratifying to state that the Accra Church of England High-class School has been fairly established and set in proper working order, and since its establishment the number of its pupils has been steadily on the increase. If, as stated in my previous correspondence, such a school as the High-class School be amply and efficiently supported, it will prove a great boon to the place. That the educational work that is thus being inaugurated here needs such support as you have pleaded for will be evident from the fact that it has not been undertaken by the Church Missionary Society, as your remarks would seem to indicate, but by the sole efforts of some of the native residents of this place, who, sensible of the great educational wants of the community, have requested the Bishop of Sierra Leone to aid them in the establishment here of the Church of England with a properly-organized school; and the kind-hearted prelate, ever ready to lend a helping hand to every very good work, promised to aid their efforts in the undertaking. From this it will be seen that such needful help as you have advocated is a *sine qua non* in the proper development of education in this place; and should it be afforded, an efficient staff of competent teachers will be secured, and high-class schools, grammar schools, collegiate schools, and other seminaries of learning will be established along this Coast, which will undoubtedly be productive of unspeakable benefit to the country at large. This, Mr. Editor, in my humble opinion, will be the only panacea for the effectual eradication of the moral, social, and intellectual evil under which ""the land is groaning.""\n\nThe hope of this country\'s elevation seems to me to be in the rising and future generations, in the proper development of their intellectual faculties, and the instilment into their minds of the ""sweets"" of education.

We had buried our first-born there, a little boy of six years.\n\nBut poor Africa—what can be done for her? I rejoice in the success of Dr. Livingston, and of every other explorer and labourer in Africa; but much more need to be and can be done for her. 1. She needs missionaries and teachers, but these alone will not do the work needed. Accompanying them should be (2) farmers and mechanics, who can teach them civilization, for both must go together—civilization and Christianity: either without the other will fail; but both united will, with God's blessing, lift her up, and soon give her a place among the nations.\n\nShe has natural resources abundant. 1. The people are capable of being educated in the arts and sciences, in which they make rapid proficiency when an opportunity is provided. In managing business, mercantile or other, they manifest an ability equal to the whites. The richest men in Sierra Leone are negroes who were taken out of the slave ship. They make very efficient preachers, teachers, mechanics, farmers, &c., when instructed.\n\n2. The country is rich—very productive in many things needful for commerce and home consumption. Rice, Indian corn, and some smaller grains, suited to exportation, can be produced to any extent. Ginger, pepper, arrowroot, can be supplied to meet the wants of the world. Coffee and cotton of fine quality grow wild abundantly, and can be cultivated to any extent to supply Manchester and every cotton factory in Christendom. There only needs to do this to start it all along the Western Coast, and make a market for them, and the natives will go to producing them. They will work at what they can make the most money by. Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down. These things I have seen.\n\n3. And her minerals are rich and abundant. Gold and iron ore, the purest in the world, is very abundant in many parts.

We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Roll of African Worthies', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Our heart swells with exultation whenever we are able to point to a name to be inscribed on the historical roll of African worthies.

Her Chamber of Deputies has granted the De Brazza mission, by a vote of 449 to 3, a credit of a million and a quarter of francs. The Portuguese Government has appointed explorers and examined the Congo country, and assumes to exercise control over all the territory at the mouth of the Congo. The German Reichstag has increased its annual appropriation for the exploration of Africa. Italy has despatched a party to Abyssinia for geographical and mercantile purposes. She has also concluded treaties which promise to make Assab a centre of commerce. The Sultan of Morocco has authorized Spain to take possession of Santa Cruz del Mar, and the Sultan of Zanzibar has purchased six superior steamers to constitute a regular coast service, in the interest of commerce and for the suppression of the slave-trade. The International African Association, which owes its origin to the philanthropic initiative of Leopold II., King of the Belgians, has received large subscriptions and pushed forward exploring expeditions to start and equip the line of hospitable and scientific stations which are to bound the East and West Coast, and form a civilizing girdle around Central Africa. And the results following the explorations of Livingstone and Stanley and De Brazza are attracting the attention of the civilized world. What was a \'Dark Continent,\' by the indomitable energy of these explorers, seems likely to prove the richest quarter of the globe.

There is a peculiar work for them to accomplish, both in the land of their bondage, and in the land of their fathers, which no other people can achieve. With the present prospects and privileges before his race - with the chances of arduous work, noble suffering, and magnificent achievement before them - I would rather be a member of this race than a Greek in the time of Alexander, a Roman in the Augustin period, or an AngloSaxon in the nineteenth century. 46 It was also Blyden who in his famous speech to the American Col› onization Society in May 1880 gave great publicity to the phrase 'Ethiopia Stretching Out her Hands Unto God' and equated Ethiopian with African; and it was he who first used the term 'African personality' in his lecture delivered on 19 May 1893 in Freetown when he described the African Race as 'a Great Race - great in its vitality, in its power of endurance and its prospect of perpetuity'. He continued: It is sad to think that there are some Africans, especially among those who have enjoyed the advantages of foreign training, who are so blind to the radical facts of humanity as to say, 'Let us do away with the sentiment of Race. Let us do away with our African personality and be if possible in another Race ...

This is a question that has so far not been seriously considered by historians, African or European, but it needs to be answered. The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy. Asante must remain as of old at the same time to remain friendly with all white men. I do not write this in a boastful spirit but in the clear sense of its meaning ... the cause of Asante is progressing and there is no reason for any Asante man to feel alarm at the prospects or to believe for a single instant that our cause has been driven back by the events of the past hostilities. 2\nIn 1895, Wobogo, the Moro Naba, or King of the Mossi (in modern Upper Volta), told the French officer, Captain Destenave: I know that the whites wish to kill me in order to take my country, and yet you claim that they will help me to organize my country.

A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation.

Most of the discussion, if not all of it, has been centred on the dichotomy between resisters, who by implication are to be praised as heroes, and so-called collaborators, who also by implication are to be condemned as traitors. This classification came about as a result of the nationalist struggle for independence in Africa, as elsewhere in the world. Those involved in the movement tended to see themselves as heirs to a long tradition of struggle whose roots go back to the beginning of this century, if not earlier. It was assumed that independence was a good thing and to strive for it was natural.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there.

One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority. Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage. The indigenous elites have patronized change as a way of getting Africa on to her feet and making her states equal members of the community of nations."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The most important and most discussed African component was the local chief. Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""In theory such indirect administration also applied to French colonial activities south of the Sahara, but in fact practice was at severe variance with it. In a statement frequently referred to as most descriptive of the methods which the French actually pursued in this region between the wars, the Governor-General of French West Africa, Joost Van Vollenhoven, remarked in 1917: The chiefs 'have no power of their own, for there are not two authorities in the cercle ... ; there is only one! Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

The more numerous Ijo to the east and west of the Itsekiri did not develop centralized polities of a size to offer effective competition. In the immediate hinterland, the Urhobo and Isoko were also largely organized in decentralized communities, and served as the producers and suppliers of slaves and, later, palm oil and palm kernels to the Itsekiri middlemen. However, up to the nineteenth century, the Itsekiri kingdom itself was known to the European visitors as merely a 'principality' of the Benin kingdom. Accordingly, early traders to the western delta usually went up the Benin river to the port of Gwato (Ughoton) where they dealt with the agents of the qba of Benin.\nFrom about the late seventeenth century, direct Benin influence began to fade in the western delta, and European traders began to use ports within the Niger delta on the Benin, Escravos, and Forcados estuaries. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, several Itsekiri chiefs had moved from Warri (Ode Itsekiri) to establish trading posts on the Benin estuary, and soon the Benin port of Gwato (Ughoton) ceased to be a centre of the overseas trade. Throughout the nineteenth century, then, the Itsekiri were the effective leaders in the trade of the western delta, and Benin had to receive supplies of European goods through them.3 Benin tried to maintain political dominance over the Itsekiri kingdom, and demanded a form of tribute in trade goods from the Olu of Warri, on pain of the closure of the hinterland trade routes. However, Olu Akengbuwa was able to defy the oba of Benin, to the extent of giving asylum to a dissident Benin chief.

If we trace the history of any nation emerging from barbarism to civilization, we shall find that, though the first move was effected through foreign conquest or occupation, the remainder has been achieved by the people themselves—the first move has been effected as regards the Western Coast of Africa. European stations have been formed; European laws and customs have been introduced, European civilization has been witnessed; but are the Africans, as a race, emulating this example? Go outside any of the European settlements, and I fear you will still find slavery, torture, superstition, idolatry, and idleness. Until the Africans themselves shake off these vices, though we may succeed in establishing civilization in isolated parts, as in this colony, Africa as a country can never rise.

J.

Philanthropists have done much and very much for us, and it is as little as we can do for ourselves to show that we are not ignorant of or ungrateful for their priceless service. When I contrast the present state of the colony with what it was in days gone by I am lost in astonishment at the changes that have been wrought. I remember being on one occasion at the Bananas where I was called upon to preach, and during my discourse I observed an old man who wept bitter tears. After the service was concluded, I asked him what in the discourse so sensibly affected him, when he replied, ""My son, I cannot refrain from weeping when I see our own children preaching to us the Gospel of peace. We had not that privilege, and had any one told me that I should be permitted to see our own children put in such a position I should not have believed it—I should have considered such a thing impossible."" Now I ask you, Gentlemen, by whose influence has this change, with others equally great and beneficial to our race, been brought about? Why, by the efforts of the good people in England. But the time has come when we should not look to them to do all for us; we are now capable to help ourselves, and to benefit by the example which they have set us. Through the kindness of some kind-hearted friends in that land who paid for my education, I owe my present standing. I am grateful for what has been done for my country and myself, and shall always endeavor to prove myself so. But I must say that our native merchants in good and prosperous circumstances do not do their duty to the country as they should. How many of the sons of the soil have been educated by any of them and at their expense? I know not of a single instance. Foreigners have come here and supported at our Grammar-school youths who have turned out a blessing to the country, whilst our own wealthy countrymen have shown themselves destitute of any feeling of their duty in this respect. Are we to leave everything to strangers to do for us? Are we never to put forth an effort to help ourselves? Is the whole burden to be thrown on our Anti-Slavery friends? I say no; we must be aroused to our duty. There is a great work before us, we have been made free, and in our turn we must free others. Slavery, as we all know, exists among the surrounding tribes; we must discourage it by pointing out its evil, and by sending the Gospel to enlighten and subdue them. We must do more than we have all along been doing; we must show our friends in England that their labor has not been spent in vain; we must prove our gratitude by copying their bright example. It is time that we form an Anti-Slavery Society among ourselves, to put down the hateful system wherever it is found in Africa. Those of us who have felt the bitterness know how it brutalizes man, the noblest of God\'s creatures, and how it destroys all his powers, both of body and mind. Now we are here called upon to recognize the claims which Mr. Chamerovzow, the noble Secretary of the Anti-Slavery Society, has on us. It is well known that this gentleman for eighteen years has been spending his time in advocating our cause, and opposing slavery wherever it existed. We have been told by another speaker that his services were so sparingly rewarded, owing to the very limited means of the society, that now that society is virtually extinct, we find Mr. Chamerovzow with a family unprovided for. We are called upon now to show our gratitude by raising a substantial testimonial to the Secretary, and we are to do this liberally in proportion to our means. This is a matter which concerns every son of Africa, for all have been benefited by the exertions of the noble Secretary and the society of which, I may say, he was the life. There must be, I say, no niggardly giving in this matter; we must give freely, liberally, and with all our heart.

In your paper alluded to, it was said to be desired here that the Primitive Methodist Committee at home should send a European school teacher; but we do not all think thus, and I must say in plain words that the school we have at Fernando Po does not require a European school teacher, because we believe that an African school teacher is preferable to a European school teacher. An African teacher can better understand the ways, manners, and conduct of his country\'s children than a European teacher, especially in our island. Again, great men have said that if Africa should be evangelised, it would be by her own sons. Why should African young men, well qualified to teach their country\'s children in different branches of education, be put aside and a European teacher be sent for? We are confident enough that there are young men better qualified to fill the post of school teachers than such European teachers as would be sent for. Let the Primitive Committee at home observe that all down the Western Coast of Africa all schools are under the government of African young men. Let them look to Sierra Leone. There they will see a grammar-school, under the superintendence of an African clergyman as principal, whose boys are displaying his good tuition in institutions, colleges, and universities in England. The late Lord Brougham said, ""Tell me no more that the African has no mind."" The African has now established before the world that ""he has mind,"" and I feel sure that the Primitive Methodist Society would be able to find a properly-qualified and high-principled teacher in Sierra Leone for their Fernando Po school.

Liberia has been a black republic for forty years; Sierra Leone has been a negro colony for a century; and it cannot be denied that each of these communities has made very gratifying progress. Yet, upon Dr. Blyden's own showing, that progress has been but partial, he still has to complain of his countrymen's imitativeness and lack of backbone. The responsibility for this, undoubtedly, rests to some extent upon the unsuitable character of the education which the civilized negroes have received; but it is more to the purpose to remember that three generations is a very brief period in the development of a pagan people. How slow the work of civilization in Liberia has been may be seen from the fact that, whereas there are some twenty thousand Christian negroes in the republic, there are more than a million who are pagans. And now we inevitably come to the primary question of all: whether or not the presumed racial inferiority of the negro is proved. Dr. Blyden pleads eloquently for his fellows, and triumphantly asks: How could an inferior race have produced Toussaint L'Ouverture? The question is not unnatural, but it is far from logical. The matter, as it fashions itself to us, is, and is likely to remain for a long time to come, an open one. The negro has, as yet, enjoyed no sufficient opportunity of proving either his mental equality with or his inferiority to the white. The experience of Sierra Leone and Liberia, so far as it has gone, has been in his favour; what we know of his moral history in that other black republic, Hayti, and in the United States, is at the best negative. As time goes on, the question, which is far more momentous than would appear to the unthinking, will settle itself. Emigration from America to Liberia, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, is proceeding satisfactorily; and Dr. Blyden states that 200,000 negroes in the United States are prepared to return to the land of their fathers. But colonization by private effort is, at the best, exceedingly slow; and in this instance it is perhaps well that it is so, since the gradual settlement of Liberia is far more likely to provide material for a strong and healthy State than a hasty rush would be. Social reformers for many a year to come will watch the experiment, as they have watched it in the past, with keen interest. The chief danger lies, as Dr. Blyden constantly points out, in the tendency to Europeanize the negro—to supersede customs and practices which are useful and often necessary in Africa by customs utterly out of place there. The ill-directed zeal of some of the less reflective missionaries has, no doubt, been to blame for some of this; but there is, we fancy, very little to complain of upon this head now.

We had buried our first-born there, a little boy of six years.\n\nBut poor Africa—what can be done for her? I rejoice in the success of Dr. Livingston, and of every other explorer and labourer in Africa; but much more need to be and can be done for her. 1. She needs missionaries and teachers, but these alone will not do the work needed. Accompanying them should be (2) farmers and mechanics, who can teach them civilization, for both must go together—civilization and Christianity: either without the other will fail; but both united will, with God's blessing, lift her up, and soon give her a place among the nations.\n\nShe has natural resources abundant. 1. The people are capable of being educated in the arts and sciences, in which they make rapid proficiency when an opportunity is provided. In managing business, mercantile or other, they manifest an ability equal to the whites. The richest men in Sierra Leone are negroes who were taken out of the slave ship. They make very efficient preachers, teachers, mechanics, farmers, &c., when instructed.\n\n2. The country is rich—very productive in many things needful for commerce and home consumption. Rice, Indian corn, and some smaller grains, suited to exportation, can be produced to any extent. Ginger, pepper, arrowroot, can be supplied to meet the wants of the world. Coffee and cotton of fine quality grow wild abundantly, and can be cultivated to any extent to supply Manchester and every cotton factory in Christendom. There only needs to do this to start it all along the Western Coast, and make a market for them, and the natives will go to producing them. They will work at what they can make the most money by. Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down. These things I have seen.\n\n3. And her minerals are rich and abundant. Gold and iron ore, the purest in the world, is very abundant in many parts.

We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Tribute to African Times', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'From a distinguished Christian labourer in Africa: ""From a twenty years\' African experience, I know some of the difficulties that beset your path in advocating the interests of Africa, and in seeking to promote the amelioration of her millions of inhabitants; but your path is that of truth and justice, which has prevailed, and will prevail, in doing good at home and abroad; therefore, take courage, and go on in the good work.""', 'last_edit_date': '1864-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1864#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICAN PROSPECTS', 'section_title': '', 'content': '**THE COURSE OF CIVILIZATION.**—History proves that barbarous countries do not emerge from barbarism by development from within, but by accretion from without. America derived its culture from Western Europe; the people of Western Europe received theirs from the Romans; the Romans from the Greeks; the Greeks from the Phoenicians and Egyptians; and long before Tyrian merchants trafficked, or Egypt became the school of the world, a high civilization and a profound philosophy had a home beyond the Indus, in the old cradle of mankind. One race hands the torch of science to another; but no one seems to know how to strike the fire for itself. Had no invader gained a footing in England, this island would have remained in barbarism to this day; and America had been still the hunting-ground of the savage, had not civilization been imported. Africa is behind the rest; and yet not very far behind, for in the life of humanity three or four centuries are but as three or four years in the life of a man. She has not made time with her sister continents in the race of improvement, not because she is a sandy desert, for the fertility of her soil is exuberant, capable of enriching commerce with a profusion of valuable products which the world wants, but because she has been reserved for the habitation of black men, and the white men who attempt to explore and cultivate her perish. It was written that Africa should be redeemed by her own children; not those born on her soil, but those who shall have passed through the apprenticeship of servitude in strange lands, and learned the arts and religion of Christian nations in bondage.\n\n**CAN TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF.**—In a recent speech, ex-Governor Wright, of Indiana, said: ""As to the cant about the negro\'s ability to take care of himself, he had these facts to relate, and he would do so without comment: In 1862, the rebel Legislature of South Carolina raised a committee to inquire into the expediency of enslaving the 5,000 free negroes of Charleston. That committee reported against it, and stated that those 5,000 free negroes paid into the treasury of Charleston annually 27,000 dolls., and that their property amounted annually to 1,500,000 dolls. Out of that amount of property, 300,000 dolls. of it was composed of slaves. That the 9,000 free negroes of New Orleans in 1860 were worth as much *per capita* as the white people of Louisiana; that these free negroes had their own schools, their own benevolent societies, &c. These facts, he contended, proved that the free negro was capable of taking care of himself. He also stated that a lady who owned 500 negroes in 1860 told him that she had lost them all but 200 by the beginning of 1863. That year she made a contract with them to cultivate her farm on the shares, and that last year, under such a system, where the negro was working for himself as well as for his mistress, the 200 made her more money than 500 had done in slavery.""\n\n---\n\n**NOTICE OF PARTNERSHIP.**', 'last_edit_date': '1865-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Too much praise cannot be given you for your unwearied and long-continued efforts on behalf of poor Africa and her unfortunate sons.

If, as stated in my previous correspondence, such a school as the High-class School be amply and efficiently supported, it will prove a great boon to the place. That the educational work that is thus being inaugurated here needs such support as you have pleaded for will be evident from the fact that it has not been undertaken by the Church Missionary Society, as your remarks would seem to indicate, but by the sole efforts of some of the native residents of this place, who, sensible of the great educational wants of the community, have requested the Bishop of Sierra Leone to aid them in the establishment here of the Church of England with a properly-organized school; and the kind-hearted prelate, ever ready to lend a helping hand to every very good work, promised to aid their efforts in the undertaking.

The names of such American-educated colonial African students are legion and include recent heads of state (such as Nnamdi Azikiwe, Kwame Nkrumah, and Kamuzu Banda) as well as earlier nationalist or community leaders such as A. B. Xuma, John Dube, Marshall and Charlotte Maxeke, J. E. K. Aggrey, Pixley Ka Izaka Seme, D. S. Malekebu, Franck Osam-Pinanko, Peter Koinange, Ndabaningi Sithole, Eduardo Mondlane and John Chilembwe.

They also set themselves the task of refuting and disproving racist ideas and practices in a series of articles, pamphlets, books and speeches, and it was this that gave rise to the second of the unique processes of the period, namely, the intellectual revolution and the accompanying birth of African racial consciousness, pan-Africanism and the concept of the African personality. The pioneers of this revolution in West Africa were undoubt› edly James Africanus Horton (1835-83) and Edward Wilmot Blyden (18321912). Among the works of Horton on the themes in question were Political Economy of British Western Africa, with the requirements of the several colonies and settlements: An African view of the Negro place in Nature (1865); West African Countries and Peoples: A Vindication of the African Race (1868); and Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast (1870). In West African Countries and Peoples, Horton refuted the idea of inherent racial inferiority of the black man by arguing that the difference in the stages of civilization between whites and blacks arose 'entirely from the influence of external circumstances'. To those who moved from the assump› tion of racial inferiority of the black to the assumption that he would ultimately disappear from the face of the earth in the face of white power, Horton argued: we find that wherever the African race has been carried to ... they increase, no matter under what depressing and burdensome yoke they may suffer; from which it may be safely inferred that the African people is a permanent and enduring people, and the fancies of those who had determined their destruction will go in the same limbo as the now almost defunct American slavery. 40 Finally, in answer to the proposition that the black was incapable of improvement, he argued: 'Africans are not incapable of improvement, but that by the assistance of good and able men they are destined to figure in the course of time, and to take a prominent part in the history of the civilized world'.$^{41}$ Again in his Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast, Horton wrote in the Preface: Horton not only condemned racism but was also one of the earliest advocates of pan-Africanism.

Aggrey was steered to Livingstone College in Salisbury, North Carolina, the chief educational institution of the AME Zion Church, with the apparent understanding that he would return directly to Africa in the service of the Church. Upon taking a baccalaureate and a divinity degree, however, Aggrey accepted employment in the AME Zion publishing house in Charlotte, became correspondent for one or two black newspapers, conducted free classes for black teachers in the vicinity, was ordained a Church elder, and was offered a pastorate by two black churches.

In Southern Africa, whites had monopolized all the employment opportunities that might have been open to educated Africans, be they in the administration, the economic sector, the church or other spheres of life.\nBy the same token, the intelligentsia in Southern Africa was from its inception closer to the people.

Indications are that industrial or vocational training was welcomed by the colonial entrepreneur since it enabled him to secure well-trained artisans to drive motor lorries, build his houses, and manage his mechanical or electrical plant.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools.

There is a peculiar work for them to accomplish, both in the land of their bondage, and in the land of their fathers, which no other people can achieve.

He continued: It is sad to think that there are some Africans, especially among those who have enjoyed the advantages of foreign training, who are so blind to the radical facts of humanity as to say, 'Let us do away with the sentiment of Race. Let us do away with our African personality and be if possible in another Race ...

The British Government is becoming popular in the countries around. This is no doubt caused by the reports of native traders and the spectacle of peace and order which the colony presents to those who visit it; and this feeling ought to be taken advantage of for the welfare of Africa, and the diminution of slavery, blood shedding, and a host of heathen atrocities which idolatry and ignorance have engendered.

We have at length, thank God, established a public school, under a most gifted inspector, Mr. Popplestone; and the Governor, with that wisdom which characterises all his public acts, has inaugurated the splendid and inspiriting system of competitive examination. A new and rising generation will thus see the Legislative Council enlarged, and the educated African having a voice in the little senate of his country. An educated people can never be an oppressed people any more than strong waters can be kept in complete subjection.

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs. It shows nice powers of observation—great diligence—a clear appreciation of facts, and a mental daring that does not shrink from the great problems of the future of the various divisions of his race, on which the light of Christian civilisation is only now beginning to shine, and who are for the most part placed under circumstances most unfavourable to its increase. After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries. Showing us their actual condition, and exposing many errors of administration which are opposed to material development and social advancement, he views the whole in connexion with the resolutions of the late House of Commons Committee, 1865, recommending the preparing of the several people for self-government. He shows the great changes that must be induced and fostered to make such self-government possible, safe, or beneficial. Though he has evidently a deep and, we believe, a just faith in his race, he does not shut his eyes to any of the disadvantages of their actual position and the difficulties in the way of their progress toward Christianity, civilisation, and wealth.

The Government holds a position on the Gold Coast; this position is enhanced, and its responsibility increased, by the Act which has recently liberated hundreds of thousands of slaves from bondage, or at least placed them on the way to claim their freedom.

We do not regard it as a mere accident, that among the Africans delivered by British cruisers from the power of the foreign slave-trader, and subsequently introduced to the knowledge of the English language by education, and of Christianity by the teaching of zealous missionaries, the Akus should predominate in numbers; or that (so far as our knowledge on this point at present extends) they and the Eboes, their near neighbours in Western Africa, should have afforded superior evidence of the capability of the African to attain to and receive both secular and Christian enlightenment. We believe that God, in His providence, has so overruled events for special results; and shall not therefore be surprised to see some combined efforts, by these instruments thus specially prepared, for bringing such enlightenment to the native mind within the territories peopled by their race, as may prepare the way, among other things, to the adoption by the authorities of Abeokuta of those means of defence and security which the advanced civilization of Europe can and is ready to supply.

There are two objects that they ought to strive for, constantly and untiringly—and will so strive for, if their education and Christianity be worth anything—beyond those blessed individual influences on character and principle which ought to flow immediately from them. These two things are, the obtaining for Abeokuta, and the territory between it and Dahomey, that delivery and security without which nothing permanently beneficial can be hoped for; and the forming an easy and speedy land communication between Abeokuta and a point on the waters toward Lagos, to which the navigation is at all times open. These two things are intimately allied, for if such easy and rapid communication existed between Abeokuta and Lagos, it would be such an element of power to Abeokuta that the Dahomans would never thereafter think for a single moment of disturbing its industrial activity by their atrocious raids. We urge it as a duty upon all those who are connected with that country by ties of blood and birth, to employ combined as well as individual efforts for the accomplishment of this great end.

We repeat our belief that coloured artisans from America are valuable, if not indispensable, for this work.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1863#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.628, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION OF SOUTH AFRICAN TRIBES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At a meeting of the Royal Colonial Institute, held lately in the Grosvenor Gallery Library, New Bond-street, a paper was read by Mr. William Greswell, M.A., on ""The Education of the South African Tribes."" The lecturer said: The future of South Africa was much bound up with this question of administration, and especially the educational part of it. A proper education meant an assimilation of the coloured man to the ideal of the white man, with regard to habits of mind and of thought. The question of education was visibly affected by political disturbances. With regard to the general question, which was viewed in many different ways by white people both in the colony and at home, he said the great desideratum of the hour in South Africa was to raise the discussion of important matters beyond the atmosphere of party. Nothing had so much injured the native as the custom of using him for the purpose of a party cry. Premising that he should confine himself principally to the state of affairs in the Cape Colony, the Lecturer said he should show that there had existed and did still exist in that colony a State scheme for the instruction of the natives in nearly everything they might require to know, whether it was to shoe a horse, make a wheel, or learn Greek. As he had himself endeavoured to instruct the Caffre in the Greek declensions, in his capacity as Government Lecturer in the colony, he might say that the loftiness and catholicity of the scheme had come home to him. Remarking upon the difficulties in the way of applying such a scheme in a sparsely-peopled savage country like South Africa, he said the number of white colonists at the Cape was about equal to the population of Leeds, and these had to legislate for the reclamation of more than a million blacks, who were scattered over an immense tract. Other difficulties lay in the unequal social developments among the black people, in the bi-lingual character of the white population, and in the want of unanimity on the part of the white colonists as to the proper lines upon which native education ought to go. To bring under one system of State education men of different religious views, hard though it might be, was an easy task for the political legislator compared with that encountered in an attempt to group under one plan men so intellectually and, if he might use the term, spiritually distinct as the European and the African aboriginal races. The difference between the races was, practically speaking, one absolutely of kind, not of degree. Undeterred by difficulties, legislators at the Cape had boldly grappled with the question, and they had established a complete educational ladder, with the kraal schools at the bottom and the university at the top. After going with some detail into the working of the scheme in that colony, and suggesting some possible improvements in the system, he remarked that though philanthropy in theory, in practice it was unphilosophic. A cardinal fact was ignored—the generic difference between the European and the Caffre. The principle of heredity was ignored. He was inclined to believe that the Caffre would be influenced by a simple and rather an autocratic system. Advocating a certain measure of compulsion in order to make the Caffre industrious, and to compel him to be taught, he said the educationist should walk hand in hand with the white magistrate and the missionary; these three classes of men really replace the autocracy of the chiefs. He thought that if the philanthropist could be persuaded to believe that all men were not equal, and if the Boer could be persuaded to believe that they might be equal in course of time—in fact, that there was a germ which might be worked upon in the native, there would be some chance of an agreement. If both philanthropist and Boer should take the scientific view that the Caffre was really nothing more than he was by descent, a savage pure and simple, but that he had in him the makings of a good citizen, there would be considerably less friction in South Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1884#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When writing last month on the all-important subject of the future spread of Christian civilization in West Africa, we pointed out that educated natives, more or less under the influence of Christian faith, more or less imbued with Christian principles, more or less governed by Christian precepts, are and will be indispensable as a vanguard of the great army of civilization that must be projected upon the ignorant barbarism of heathen Africa whenever the means for such projection shall be arranged. We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""and Lagos, shall become convinced by the introduction of the necessary machinery for such purpose, that it is the desire and determination of the supreme sovereign power, the British Government, to effect their civilization. It has now been sufficiently established that the Africans are receptive, that they are easily taught not only the rudiments of education, but when good masters are found for them, and they are placed under a good system, the higher branches also. We are not, therefore, asking the British Government to take a leap in the dark—to organize educational institutions without absolute knowledge as to whether the people are capable of receiving education. We could point to members of that once despised African race who occupy really an eminent position in law and medicine; and if we have not yet skilled engineers among them, it is only because there have not yet been inducements among them to the cultivation of those sciences whose mighty power is at this time revolutionizing the world. There is every possible encouragement, therefore, to the British Government in entering upon the noble work which we maintain that it is now their duty to undertake and set about in right good earnest. We would have two superior institutions established, one at Lagos and the other at Accra. These settlements and seats of Government are at so little distance from each other, and the facilities for passing from the one to the other are so frequent and so good, that one supreme organizing and superintending educational head would suffice for both. It is not a little feeble, glimmering light that we thirst to see introduced at those important points of West Africa, but one in educational power that shall resemble the electric among illuminating flames. Great Britain will thus, indeed, justify her presence and extend her beneficent influence on the West Coast of Africa. The work of African civilization is an immense work; the means employed, to be worth anything, must be commensurate with the end to be obtained. We need for those West African countries a host of African evangelists and apostles of civilization; we ask that ignorance shall be beaten down by an array of educational power capable of overcoming its inertia, conquering its will, and subduing to itself its sympathies and its love. Oh, 'tis a glorious work to be undertaken, a glorious aim to be accomplished—a work and an aim worthy of a Government that has taken seriously in hand the deliverance of South-eastern Europe from the paralyzing influences of a rule under which every noble aspiration has been strangled, and the commonest principles of humanity have been outraged and trampled under foot. And we cannot conceive on what ground such a work can be any longer neglected and delayed. That the whole civilized world, and more especially Great Britain and the other European countries, have the deepest possible interest in the civilization of Africa, and that development of her wondrous resources which can only take place through the diffusion of civilization, is beyond all doubt; and since West Africa herself, under the organizing and administrative help of Great Britain, can be made to furnish the means, we earnestly exhort the Secretary of State for the Colonies to plant there without delay that tree of knowledge which alone can effect it. It is only thus that the prophecies of a Buxton and a Palmerston can be fulfilled; and Africa become the glory, instead of the reproach and disgrace, of the Christian civilized world."", 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.616, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICA AND HER EVANGELIZATION', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""It is difficult to eradicate the old habits acquired by age.

Indeed, by the end of the First World War, Garvey's militant newspaper, The Negro World under the editorship of Hubert Harrison, a Caribbean journalist living in New York - struck a responsive chord among the black masses in New York, throughout North America, and in Africa. Garvey's message to all was: organize, buy black, support the Black Star Steamship Line (which could take black emigrants to Africa and bring back raw materials), and help drive whites out of Africa. He stressed that: We are the descendants of a suffering people. We are the descendants of a people determined to suffer no longer ... We do not desire what has belonged to others, though others have always sought to deprive us of that which belonged to us ... The other races have countries of their own and it is time for the 400,000,000 Negroes [of the world] to claim Africa for themselves. 55 Whereas Du Bois was a greater pan-African force among black intellectuals outside Africa, and Washington was better known among rural artisan classes, Garvey's influence fell equally upon the submerged black masses of all strata both outside and inside Africa. Garvey received much of his own pan-Africanist inspiration from the Egyptian intellectual, Duse Muhammad Ali, while in England in 1912 and from reading, also in London, Washington's autobiography, Up From Slavery.\nInitially organized around the idea of setting up a Tuskegee-type school in Jamaica, Garvey's UNIA became the organizational link between large numbers of Africans and American blacks outside Africa, and, through The Negro World, achieved substantial pan-African effect within Africa.

The first five, with Garvey in charge, were held in New York City in August of each year from 1920 to 1924, the next two, following Garvey's deportation from the United States, took place in Jamaica in 1929 and 1934, and the eighth and last, in Canada, in 1938."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.631, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The expression of African nationalism and politics', 'content': ""Social organizations which contributed to the expression of African nationalism and anti-colonial politics included the several branches in Africa of Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association which had been founded in America in 1917.

In August 1893, African and other participants from the United States and Europe attended an American Missionary Association 'World Congress on Africa', held in conjunction with the Chicago World Fair of that year.

Few responded, although a group did organize the African Development Society in 1899, the chief objective of which was to encourage Afro-Americans to buy land and settle in East Central Africa. The Society would sell shares or land rights offered by African petitioners but only to Afro-American or African purchasers. 4 Bishop Turner also later served as an adviser to the International Migration Society (IMS) of Alabama, which sent about 500 emigrants to Africa before it became defunct in 1900. Some of the 500 remained in Liberia; others returned to the United States. Those who remained fared reasonably well; evidently more than a few of them prospered. On the other hand, those who returned told horror stories of poor land, inadequate food and poor living conditions. These stories reduced the likelihood of any large-scale Afro-American emigration movement, even though prospects for blacks in the United States were declining from 1895 to 1900. Nevertheless, numerous Afro-Americans evidently continued to give serious consider› ation to African emigration, just as others in the United States and the Caribbean simply moved away from overt discriminatory practices into other regions near by.\nAfter the turn of the twentieth century, the back-to-Africa baton was picked up by others. For example, one Captain Dean, early in the twentieth century, hoped to engineer the settlement of American blacks in South Africa to fashion a powerful black state there. After the briefest sojourn meant to arrange for this settlement, however, white authorities expelled Dean from the Cape for what were termed 'provocative activities'. And in 1914, Chief Alfred C. Sam, a Gold Coast African, turned up in Oklahoma, persuaded about sixty black farmers that Africa offered them greater oppor› tunities and sailed with them to Saltpond in the Gold Coast. Finding Chief Sam's claims to be exaggerated and encountering restrictions from the Gold Coast officials which inhibited the entry of American immigrants, most of the Oklahomans eventually returned to the United States.

Moreover, in 1893, when he visited Liberia, Bishop Turner glowingly reported that 'one thing the Black man has here [in Liberia]... is Manhood, freedom; and the fullest liberty; he feels like a Lord and walks the same way'.$^{1}$ And again in 1896 he asserted: 'I believe two or three million of us should return to the land of our ancestors and establish our own nations, civilizations, laws, customs, style of manufacture ... and cease to be grumblers, chronic complainers and a menace to the white man's country he claims and is bound to dominate'.$^{2}$ Through Bishop Turner's efforts, over 300 Afro-Americans emigrated to Liberia in March 1896.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools.

Contrary to his opinion as to the conditions under which a public journal could be successfully conducted, and submitted to by him solely with the object of facilitating its establishment, a committee of a few members of the council of that society was appointed to meet monthly, prior to its publication, for considering the articles, &c., which the Editor had decided to insert. But to this the Editor attached a stipulation that he would not consent to any alterations of which he did not himself fully approve, and which he did not consider advisable or innocuous. Such a committee of course could not work, and the Editor freed himself almost immediately from the nominal restriction, which only served to increase the difficulty of bringing out the paper on the proper day, without effecting any useful purpose whatever. A perfect and entire independence of thought and opinion in the editor is essential to the success of any and every public journal. During five years, therefore, the whole labour and responsibility have, as before stated, rested with one individual, the present Editor. Such an anniversary as this is therefore a solemn one with us. The objects the Editor has endeavoured ever to keep in view have been the promotion of good government in the British African colonies and settlements, to force a removal of official abuses, to promote material development and increased facilities of transit and trade, as auxiliaries to missionary effort, and as indispensable, not to the reception of Christianity, but to the existence and spread of Christian civilization in Africa. Having entered upon this work with a deep sense of responsibility to God, we feel bound to ask ourselves how that work has been performed. With the measure and extent of its success we have nothing to do, that we leave in the hands of Him who worketh through individual agencies on the earth, according to His own infinite wisdom. But have we done our duty by the African people, and have they, on their side, done their duty towards us? As regards the former, we can only look to our motives and our desires. We have endeavoured to keep a watchful guard over ourselves as ""one who must give an account before God,"" and we have, with no small sacrifice of time and rest, conscientiously striven to give to Africa in our labours whatever talent or wisdom God may have bestowed upon us for that purpose. As regards the latter, we think we have cause of rejoicing rather than of complaint. The number of our African subscribers has continuously increased, filling up, in a way most satisfactory to us, the gaps in our subscription list caused by the withdrawals of those of our early friends who considered, we suppose, that no further effort on their part was necessary to our support. And we have given a voice—a public voice to Africa. Few people in England, unfortunately, care much about her or her concerns. The English Anti-Slavery party, fully occupied in their high and noble object of the eradication of negro slavery everywhere, have not yet had time generally to recognise the importance of paving the way, and preparing for, and aiding in the work of Christian civilization in Africa itself.

Cannot some intelligent young men devote a few days on behalf of our great advocate, the African Times? They can do it in this way, Mr. Editor. Let these young men hold public meetings in Freetown, inviting all and everyone, by having public notices posted about the streets a few days before the meetings, and in these meetings lay before the people the immense good the African Times has done and is doing for us; and there have a list and ask everyone to come forward, both men and women, and have their names enrolled as subscribers to the African Times, and on the next day go round and collect the subscriptions and hand them over to our indefatigable and warm-hearted advocate and champion, William Rainy, Esq., with the names of the subscribers. If this seems to be too much trouble, let the young men go round with a list, in the afternoons and evenings after business hours, to every house in the name of Mr. Rainy (having first asked that gentleman the privilege of using his name) and persuade every man and woman to subscribe to the African Times by explaining to them the good that paper has done for us.

Further south it was a different world, that of Upper Guinea, where decentralized farming peoples, speaking mostly West Atlantic languages, had long occupied the sea coast. From Monrovia to the Gambia, the Sudanic zone only began to have contacts with the sea coast in the eighteenth century. This region was also one of the earliest centres of European influence in Guinea-Bissau, home of Creole culture, and later Sierra Leone and Liberia. Like Senegambia, this region was important for the slave trade in the sixteenth century, though, in the eighteenth century, its role declined.\nOutside the coastal area, the two most important peoples were the Mandinka and the Fulbe (Fulani, Peul).

The Fulbe had been in the area since at least the fifteenth century but had founded the Muslim state of Futa Jallon only after 1727.\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, Portuguese influence was in decline, but the clandestine slave trade was to continue for quite a time on both sides of the anti-slavery centre of Sierra Leone. Mandinka Kaabu had trouble maintaining its influence as far as the southern shores of the Gambia, and failed altogether with its former vassals the Ba'inuk, on the coast. The Foa (Balanta), non-centralized peasants, destroyed the Ba'inuk capital in 1830, and most of the survivors joined the Mandinka or else the Joola (Dyula), the hardy 'anarchic' traditionalist rice-growers who occupied the whole coastal area to the north. In the east, the Fulbe of Futa Jallon dominated the Mandinka as far as the Gambia in Kantora. In Kaabu and its dependencies, a Fulbe minority was growing increasingly impatient with its subordinate position.\nAt this period, the French set up trading posts in the Casamance, at Karabane in 1836 and then at Seeju (Sediou) in 1838.

From there, he and his followers organized a patchwork of alliances with states around the frontiers of Buganda and then launched a series of attacks to gain the throne of his father. Kakungulu never captured Semakokiro's throne. But his activities increased the turbulence around the older admin› istrative zones of Buganda, gave the Ganda circle of leaders greater incen› tives to punish and incorporate regions of opposition to the east and to the west, and may have reinforced the violent character of relations between Buganda and its neighbours.\nKakungulu was not the first individual to attempt to convert a com› munity of refuge in the Mabira into a force of insurgency. In looking to the Mabira, Kakungulu was taking a leaf from the book of tactics of his very own father, Semakokiro. Perhaps some thirty or forty years earlier, Semakokiro sought to recover his fortunes in the Mabira, taking with him a powerful retinue of support.

In a similar vein, references have been made to the presence of Asante representatives in all types of states and also to the introduction of substantial Asante features into the Dagomba army or interventions by the Asantehene in Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes. 14 It is obvious nevertheless that the mandates of the Asante regional commissioners varied according to the situation. In the Akan regions they had to ensure that disputes were settled by enforcing observance of the Asantehene's oath so as to emphasize his sovereignty over these territories.

On the other hand, we have no evidence confirming the presence of Gonja or Dagomba contingents in the Asante army or of payment by these countries of the Asante war tax (apeatoo). The settlement of the Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes must therefore be considered as a political act with economic motives: peace in these territories guaranteed payment of the tribute, as well as the introduction of Asante institutions into the Dagomba army.

At one time, he would play the two Christian sects, Catholics and Protestants, against Muslims when he thought the latter were becoming too powerful and therefore threatening his control of the country. At another time, he would ally with Muslims against Catholics or Protestants or both depending on who he thought was dangerous to his rule. Thus, Mwanga was adept at the diplomatic game of divide and rule, a tactic which the colonizing powers were able to use so effectively in controlling Africa. When it was necessary, Mwanga resorted to a revival of some old tradition in an attempt to drive out all foreigners as happened in 1888.$^{30}$ On this occasion, he intended to entice all foreigners and their Baganda followers to a naval parade on an island on Lake Victoria. There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler. Later, however, in 1889, Mwanga managed to regain his throne only to be exiled to Kisimayu, as already indicated, in 1899, where he died in 1903."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.617, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Omani penetration and the expansion of trade > The effects of long-distance trade on East African societies', 'content': ""To illustrate how far changed conditions and opportunities brought about real changes in Nyamwezi patterns of government, we should examine briefly two of the largest states built up during the time: those of Mirambo and Nyungu ya Mawe.

Mirambo was a ruler of the small state of Uyowa to the west of Tabora. It is believed that he was probably captured in his youth by the Nguni when they invaded western Tanzania and that while he was with them he came to understand fully the possibilities of Nguni military organization. In the 1860s, using a small group of warriors, he gained control of a number of states surrounding Uyowa. Between 1870 and his death in 1884 he led many campaigns that greatly expanded the area under his control. As Jan Vansina has pointed out, his state extended 'to Buha and Burundi, to the Vinza and Tongwe in the west, to the Pimbwe and Konongo in the south, to the Nyaturu, Iramba and Sukuma in the east, and to the Sukuma and Sumbwa in the north'. 26 He gained control of the trade route between Tabora and Ujiji and in 1876 obliged the Arabs of Tabora to pay tribute to him when using the route. Mirambo is known to have sent embassies to Mutesa of Buganda in 1876 and 1881 in his attempt to control the Buganda route. He also made direct contacts with the coast in order to obtain guns directly when the Arabs tried to prevent him from getting them.

We have reason to believe that by such means, and the general adoption of proper measures for the protection and development of industry and trade by the Colonial local Government, the production and trade of the Gambia would soon increase as much.\n**[SEPT. 23, 1864.]**\n\nas the French trade has in the Senegal, and without the employ-  \nment of such expensive means as have been there resorted to.\n\n**Extract from Letter No. 11.**""}, {'id': 437, 'article_title': 'RIVER GAMBIA', 'full_section_title': 'RIVER GAMBIA', 'last_edit_date': '09-23-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1864#article-1', 'issue_date': '23_09_1864', 'content': '""I think the Governor might have done six times more than  \nhe has done to promote trade in this river.

He seems to consider that the chief Mahabah is performing a duty which the Government neglected to do, and for doing which it envies the man who is really performing very important public services, and preparing the way for the progressive civilization of the country. That man, Mahabah, he says, is not seeking his own interests only, but that of all British subjects. British merchants have been without any real, efficient protection in the river of late years, and Mahabah has made a vast improvement in this respect during the last 24 months. It is true, he proceeds, that, partly owing to the war, and partly to the famine that prevailed during the rainy season, there has been a great deficiency of produce, ""but it is far better to prepare the ground before sowing seed, than to sow it in unprepared soil."" The Pagsoos, in this river, are a people that do not work, but who go about plundering those who do work; pillaging the merchants and traders, and committing many other and great enormities. They are, in fact, a lazy, predatory, and degraded people. The late war between the British and Badiboo was caused by such deeds as are above alluded to. The British effected really nothing, but Mahabah has made an entire change. These people, before so troublesome, having been brought by him under subjection, are now learning to depend on their own labour for the means of support; so that British merchants, who previously scarcely dared to commission any traders in that part, have now been able to find employment as traders there for those who have been (so arbitrarily, as he contends) dismissed from the Government service.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-02-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1864#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Wars among the Natives of the River Gambia', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In justification of the statement that the late disturbances had their origin in British mismanagement during the late expedition against Badiboo, he states that when peace was signed, the King of Badiboo was not present—the King afterward declared that he never sued for peace—Mahabah was the messenger who concluded that peace in the King\'s name. When the King denied having been a party to this, Mahabah\'s life was in danger, the King declaring that since Mahabah was a friend of the British, and they had been satisfied with his statement relative to peace, it must have been he who encouraged the British to make war. Mahabah\'s town was then blockaded, and three of his relatives were slain. Every one attempting to leave the town was murdered. In this strait, Mahabah sallied from the town with his followers, gave battle to the Badiboos, defeated them, took their King prisoner, beheaded him, pursued the fugitives through the kingdoms of Barra and Salem, and even called upon the King of Keyang, on the other side of the river, to destroy those who had fled thither for protection.\n\nThis is at least a clear and intelligible statement, such as we were quite unable to extract from preceding accounts.

The reason why they are opposed to the Soninkee Government was, that at certain times the people generally came to the factors and begged or demanded certain articles from them, and if refused in an obstinate manner, they considered it an insult to them, as the factors were occupying the ground of their fathers. The affray then generally terminated by the traders receiving a good flogging, and being made to pay a larger demand. I do not wonder at this being complained of; but if the traders were polite and obliging to them, and showed them that the goods did not really belong to the traders, at the same time making them small presents, they generally returned double the amount in a few days in cattle.\n\nWhen Badiboo was under the Soninkee Government, traders from every part of the country came down to trade in it, as it is situated near the large and populous kingdom of Salom. At Badiboo are the best cotton and phangs, numerous bandy cloth, and an immense quantity of ground-nuts; so much so, that Badiboo, under the government of the Soninkees, produced more nuts than any other kingdom on the River Gambia. The principal ground-nut marts were Swarak, Cindah, Bany, Kintak Cundah, and Sabaj. In these towns kola are sold in great abundance for phangs, and afterwards exchanged for ground-nuts, from which the petty traders derive great benefit.\n\nThe people at Badiboo are an intermixture of Jollof, Mandigo, and Foolahs, and from them the people at Bathurst receive yearly several head of cattle, with some fresh butter, corn, and rice. Although the Soninkees are universally considered to be lazy, yet still the lower class are hard-working, and when a Soninkee chief has rule over Marabouts, it is his general practice to compel them to work, so as to pay him a portion of their earnings. But when Mahaba became chief, trade almost ceased, the people in the interior being afraid to come down, as their property would not be secured from the ravages of Mahaba's people. The Cabuncas, who occupy an extensive region in the interior of Badiboo, reaching to Rio Nunez, on the other hand, were in the habit of coming down by land to Tenderbar, and from there cross over to Badiboo for the express purpose of purchasing horses and phangs, but they have since been afraid to do so."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-11-10', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1864#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Policy of Non-Intervention in Western Africa: Its Mischievous Tendency on the Good Government of the Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The political horizon of British Gambia is by no means in a satisfactory state; clouds are gathering from a quarter which ordinary men regard as a menace to the peace of the river. A glance at the past will show us what we may expect in the future, and also how to deal with it.\n\nMahba, King of Badiboo, formidable alike to all the native kings and to the French and to the English Government, sent last September a menacing despatch (in Arabic) to Colonel D'Arcy, the officer administering the Government of the Gambia, very warlike in its tone, and by subsequent actions violated all existing treaties. He detained all the British traders within the kingdom of Badiboo, with their goods and chattels, not allowing one man to leave the place, and also prevented all ingress into Badiboo, thus putting a stop to the trade of an extensive country, whose yearly quota of ground-nuts and hides adds greatly to the revenue of the colony. What was the *casus belli*?\n\nThe ostensible cause of this warlike and menacing attitude was, that a woman with a few children* availed themselves of Mahba's temporary absence from his capital, and made their escape to the British town of Bathurst. He at once sent to Colonel D'Arcy that, unless the woman and children were delivered up, all friendly diplomatic relation must stop, and trade cease, and the ports of Badiboo must, consequently, be considered closed to English merchants.\n\nBut the real cause, to all those who have studied the character of these Marabouts, inhabitants of the River Gambia, is to be found in that ambitious, overbearing, and covetous disposition of the Mussulmans, who view with discontent the rich prize they would obtain, could they have an opportunity of making one midnight raid on the rich Babboo Christian merchants at Bathurst. The toleration of this overbearing disposition of the Marabout chieftains in the River Gambia will always lead to serious complications; they must be made to understand that the British Government, although desirous of peace, yet still will never tolerate any nonsense from them.\n\nWe have not as yet forgotten the outrageous attack of Mahfal, the Commander-in-Chief of south-eastern Badiboo, on towns in British grounds, which led to the battle of Zoobabocolong; and at present, if reports from traders are correct, the greater part of Mahba's force is threatening Albreda.

In 1861 he was an unimportant chief in the kingdom of Baddiboo, against which the last great war expedition of the British authorities in the Gambia was directed. Maba was a bigoted Mahometan, and watching his opportunity, he in 1861 rebelled against the King of Baddiboo, whom he put to death, raising himself to be supreme ruler of Baddiboo. He then declared a propaganda of Mahometanism, which he endeavoured to force by fire and sword in all the adjacent countries. His last recorded exploit was a successful attack upon some 300 French troops (Europeans), who were all slain except nine, the officer in command putting an end to his own existence.\n\nThe last French mail from Senegal brought to Europe the intelligence that this restless and cruel fanatic chief has at last met with the fate he has constantly provoked. He was therein stated to have been taken prisoner in battle by the Joloffe King of Sein, and by him put to death, his head and hands being sent by the Joloffe King to the French Governor of Senegal.\n\nBy the mail of the 2nd inst. from Bathurst we have a confirmation of this important news. As we are not of those who believe that the forcible spread of Mahometanism in Africa (and it never spreads in any other way) is desirable, we unfeignedly rejoice that this great warrior-chief, for such he undoubtedly was, exists no more to trouble the Gambia countries. He has interfered very much with the development of the ground-nut cultivation, on which the trade in the Gambia chiefly depends, and many British traders up the river have suffered severely in the troubles he was constantly exciting, and the wars he was as constantly waging; and we hope now to hear of a new era of trading prosperity there which may compensate them for their losses, and promote the spread of civilisation in those important countries.

In 1885 differences existed in the kingdom of Baddiboo, a country which, under favourable circumstances, contributes greatly to the prosperity of Gambia, because it grows the staple product of the settlement—ground nuts. The Baddiboo war, in conjunction with the simultaneous depression in the value of this staple, produced a disastrous decline in the revenue of Gambia, and therefore special efforts were made to bring about a settlement of the difficulty. After prolonged negotiations the Acting Administrator arranged a basis of peace, and the two rival chiefs, Beram Ceasey and Saide Mattie, signed treaties with the Government of Gambia in 1887, guaranteeing to stop the war, and to engage in no further hostilities without reference to the Governor at Bathurst.\n\nFor a short time matters went on satisfactorily, and preparations to cultivate Baddiboo were being renewed, when, unhappily, Saide Mattie, in opposition to the emphatic advice of the Administrator, persisted in going to the adjoining kingdom of Saloum to obtain redress for some wrong, imaginary or real, committed by the King of that country against him. Soon after the treaty was signed he proceeded with a strong contingent of his army to Saloum. The latter chief sought assistance from the French, who espoused his cause and warned Saide Mattie to return to Baddiboo. He was, however, defiant, and a fight ensued in which he and his army were utterly routed and driven back. They were pursued and dispersed, and Saide Mattie, seeing that all was over, took refuge in Albareda, and laid down his arms at the English Governor's request. He consented to go to the English settlement at Bathurst, and there he has remained ever since.\n\nThe difference made by a tribal war of this kind in the trade of the settlements on the adjacent coasts is shown by the circumstance that the trade of Gambia in ground nuts, which, in 1883, prior to the Baddiboo war, amounted to over 23,000 tons, had fallen in 1887 to less than 3,000.

It has a river frontage of about 140 miles, containing many important ports for trade, nearly all of which have been deserted during the past four years.\n\nOn the other hand, there is bad news for the country in which I now am, which for years has enjoyed peace. Tody Cubba, the notorious predatory Chief of Cantora—who has ravaged most of the countries on the left bank of the river, who ravaged Lower Jarra in 1878, and then went to the Jolah country, beyond Vintang Creek, for the last three years plundering it, until it is exhausted, selling the inhabitants into slavery, destroying trade and agriculture—having “used up” the Jolah country, has just crossed Vintang Creek, at Sanding, and attacked the town of Doombooto, which has sent for assistance to the other towns in this country, in men, arms, and ammunition. All the towns here were warned yesterday, and are preparing for war. If they act quickly, and attack Tody Cubba at once, and force him to fight with his rear resting on the Creek, he will either be crushed or will have to retreat across the Creek with heavy loss; but if they delay, and take days to “talk” over the matter of war, as these natives are prone to do, and they give Tody a week or so to secure his position, he will do that so well—as he has done before—that they will be unable to drive him out, and this country will be the scene of a war that may last until the country is exhausted and ruined as the Jolah country has been.\n\nReally, the Government should intervene with this man; he has been the terror and ruin of most of the countries on the left bank of the river for many years, and our Government have looked on.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-04-09', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1882#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.634, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'RIVER GAMBIA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The famine in the Gambia Countries seems now to be fairly at an end.

The existence of cholera in the latter half of the year, in France, Italy and Spain, necessitated, in consequence of the shipping connexion, the enforcement against those countries of quarantine restrictions. The work of vaccination was resumed during the year with some success. Considerable sanitary improvement was effected in Bathurst by the supply of public latrines, erected over sites under the regular influence of the tide; there were also supplied public dustbins, which are daily emptied by sanitary carts, the contents being buried at the low swampy part of Half Die. An appreciated local exhibition in June of the Gambia contribution of woods and products for the International Edinburgh Wood Fair, 1884, for which a silver medal was awarded, was held in the Council Chamber of Government House, which I allowed to be used for the purpose. In an agricultural sense, comparatively little local encouragement in the past has been given by those who should be specially interested in the subject. Marketable articles, on presentation, are, perhaps, bought; but little or no interest on the part of those to whom it is of most immediate moment is directed towards the development of the resources of the country, by the practical enlightenment of the natives, from whom, in the circumstances, too much is expected, as to what may or may not be in their country of commercial value.

Natives are conservative, and are indisposed to change sites, which means trouble and increased labour. Everything is taken out of the ground, comparatively nothing is put into it. For instance, as regards ground nuts, both fruit, plant, and root are removed; the first for the oil or confectionery markets of America, the two last as horse or cattle food; and as to corn, the fruit is required for food, home consumption, or sale, and the stalk for fences, thatching, or mats. Of available dyes, and they are many, the indigenous indigo plants (there are two I know of here) offer a field for extensive growth that should prove, not only in the Gambia but on this coast, of much commercial success and monetary return.

The pioneers of this revolution in West Africa were undoubt› edly James Africanus Horton (1835-83) and Edward Wilmot Blyden (18321912). Among the works of Horton on the themes in question were Political Economy of British Western Africa, with the requirements of the several colonies and settlements: An African view of the Negro place in Nature (1865); West African Countries and Peoples: A Vindication of the African Race (1868); and Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast (1870). In West African Countries and Peoples, Horton refuted the idea of inherent racial inferiority of the black man by arguing that the difference in the stages of civilization between whites and blacks arose 'entirely from the influence of external circumstances'. To those who moved from the assump› tion of racial inferiority of the black to the assumption that he would ultimately disappear from the face of the earth in the face of white power, Horton argued: we find that wherever the African race has been carried to ... they increase, no matter under what depressing and burdensome yoke they may suffer; from which it may be safely inferred that the African people is a permanent and enduring people, and the fancies of those who had determined their destruction will go in the same limbo as the now almost defunct American slavery. 40 Finally, in answer to the proposition that the black was incapable of improvement, he argued: 'Africans are not incapable of improvement, but that by the assistance of good and able men they are destined to figure in the course of time, and to take a prominent part in the history of the civilized world'.$^{41}$ Again in his Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast, Horton wrote in the Preface: Horton not only condemned racism but was also one of the earliest advocates of pan-Africanism.

They therefore opposed the exchange of forts that the British contemplated with the Dutch in order to make their respective territories homogeneous.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces. The rulers tried to use European ideas in diplomacy, judicial reforms, military reorganization and in establishing a constitutional monarchy.$^{13}$ Similarly, beleaguered as they were by aggressive white racialism, a number of the new states in Southern Africa such as Moshoeshoe's kingdom of the Basuto accepted missionaries as their advisers and external champions, protected them and even prom› ulgated laws to assist them in their work of conversion.$^{14}$ In the Fante states on the Gold Coast and at other important missionary centres, notably Abeokuta in south-western Yorubaland, a number of Western-educated African leaders used their literacy and European contacts to get reforms carried out in the traditional state structures. These included the creation of chancelleries to be managed by literate Africans to control diplomatic relations with Europeans and guide the external relations of the states; the reform of tax systems by the introduction of regulated taxes in place of tolls and tribute; and the improvement of the judicial system by the introduction of record-keeping and putting enacted laws into writing. 15"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Ethiopianism', 'content': ""condemned racism but was also one of the earliest advocates of pan-Africanism.

In these works he also advocated 'Africa for the Africans', pan-Africanism, the African personality, Islam and polygamy which were to him more in keeping with African personality, insisted on the purity and integrity of the black race and therefore condemned mixed marriages, championed Ethiopianism and, above all, preached racial pride. In an article published in 1874, he praised the Mande and Fulbe peoples, who were Muslims and were developing the idea of a national and social order without the aid or hindrance of foreigners.

With the present prospects and privileges before his race - with the chances of arduous work, noble suffering, and magnificent achievement before them - I would rather be a member of this race than a Greek in the time of Alexander, a Roman in the Augustin period, or an AngloSaxon in the nineteenth century. 46 It was also Blyden who in his famous speech to the American Col› onization Society in May 1880 gave great publicity to the phrase 'Ethiopia Stretching Out her Hands Unto God' and equated Ethiopian with African; and it was he who first used the term 'African personality' in his lecture delivered on 19 May 1893 in Freetown when he described the African Race as 'a Great Race - great in its vitality, in its power of endurance and its prospect of perpetuity'. He continued: It is sad to think that there are some Africans, especially among those who have enjoyed the advantages of foreign training, who are so blind to the radical facts of humanity as to say, 'Let us do away with the sentiment of Race. Let us do away with our African personality and be if possible in another Race ...

When he was accused in 1881 of being antiwhite, Johnson replied: With the missionaries of the present day an independent thought in an African and a clear enunciation of his convictions are a great crime.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change.

The much-heralded black emigration schemes trumpeted by Garvey, whose ubiquitous publications reached deep into Africa, were only one example of a leitmotif which brought American blacks within the world view of African peoples. The themes of African redemption through American black missionaries were another.\nAfricans themselves, however, created the context of their next interaction with American blacks as they matriculated at American, largely Afro-American, schools and attended pan-African conferences and the like. Consequently, many Africans underwent a technical-educationalpolitical experience alien to their colonial world. When they re-entered their own worlds, many felt driven to resolve questions of ideology, cultural definition, educational values, political power, and pan-African unity or consciousness, guided by new perspectives.\nViewed against such an historical backdrop, the numerous pan-African conferences, Tuskegean educational and technical projects, the nØgritude movement and the occasional focus on American blacks in African millen› nial dreams, all illustrate the consistency of the pan-African theme among American and Caribbean blacks. They also show the variability of African responses to the New World overtures and ultimately the shaping by Africans themselves of these overtures to fit African specifications.\nIn sum, the populations of the African diaspora and the motive charac› terizing the many interactions between persons of the first and second black worlds included two visions. One was a vision of the union of religious forces among black populations in Africa and America or the reconstruction of Africa through importation of American and Antillean black technical expertise, initiated at the behest of American blacks. Another reflected the transformation of Africans from predicate to subject during the colonial period. The latter was a vision of the spiritual redemption, social recon› struction, and political reformation of African communities through the repatriation of African personnel and the energizing of African resources. Because of this vision, Africans had been educated in American schools, or sent to participate in technical and commercial activities; others were touched by American black writings or by anti-colonial ventures organized among blacks of the diaspora.

In turn, the Renaissance movement was fuelled by a rising cultural identification with Africa. Countee Cullen wondered poetically 'What is Africa to Me?' in his poem called 'Heritage', while Langston Hughes in his poem 'The Negro Speaks of Rivers' mentions how he built his hut near the Congo and it lulled him to sleep.$^{63}$ Both greatly influenced Senghor and the nØgritude writers.\nBut it was another Jamaican, Claude McKay, whose poetry helped to unify cultural and political pan-Africanism, when he insisted through the vehicle of his poetry that blacks should acknowledge, and protest against their common suffering and assert their dignity. Particularly telling was a defiant McKay poem, later used without credit by Winston Churchill during the Battle of Britain, called 'If We Must Die'.

Few responded, although a group did organize the African Development Society in 1899, the chief objective of which was to encourage Afro-Americans to buy land and settle in East Central Africa. The Society would sell shares or land rights offered by African petitioners but only to Afro-American or African purchasers. 4 Bishop Turner also later served as an adviser to the International Migration Society (IMS) of Alabama, which sent about 500 emigrants to Africa before it became defunct in 1900. Some of the 500 remained in Liberia; others returned to the United States. Those who remained fared reasonably well; evidently more than a few of them prospered. On the other hand, those who returned told horror stories of poor land, inadequate food and poor living conditions. These stories reduced the likelihood of any large-scale Afro-American emigration movement, even though prospects for blacks in the United States were declining from 1895 to 1900. Nevertheless, numerous Afro-Americans evidently continued to give serious consider› ation to African emigration, just as others in the United States and the Caribbean simply moved away from overt discriminatory practices into other regions near by.\nAfter the turn of the twentieth century, the back-to-Africa baton was picked up by others. For example, one Captain Dean, early in the twentieth century, hoped to engineer the settlement of American blacks in South Africa to fashion a powerful black state there. After the briefest sojourn meant to arrange for this settlement, however, white authorities expelled Dean from the Cape for what were termed 'provocative activities'. And in 1914, Chief Alfred C. Sam, a Gold Coast African, turned up in Oklahoma, persuaded about sixty black farmers that Africa offered them greater oppor› tunities and sailed with them to Saltpond in the Gold Coast. Finding Chief Sam's claims to be exaggerated and encountering restrictions from the Gold Coast officials which inhibited the entry of American immigrants, most of the Oklahomans eventually returned to the United States.

I do so because this may be the last opportunity I may have of publicly addressing you; and I wish honestly to state my opinions. I have lately heard of an opinion, almost a prophecy, very decidedly given, that Africa _must_ become a dominant nation; and this opinion was given by two individuals very different in station, much about the same time, and that time very recently. One was by a Cabinet Minister in England, at Aberdeen, the other in an essay delivered at the last distribution of prizes in the grammar school here by one of the instructors. Now, far be it from me either to deny the prophecy, or become a prophet myself; but I think that, in both instances, though the ""tale has been adorned,"" the moral has not been pointed. There is but one way in which Africa can be advanced, and that is, by the honesty, by the industry, and by the well-directed energy of the Africans themselves. If we trace the history of any nation emerging from barbarism to civilization, we shall find that though the first move was effected through foreign conquest or occupation, the remainder has been achieved by the people themselves. The first move has been effected as regards the Western Coast of Africa. European stations have been formed; European laws and customs have been introduced; European civilization has been witnessed; but are the Africans, as a race, emulating this example? Go outside any of the European settlements, and I fear you will still find slavery, torture, superstition, idolatry, and idleness. Until the Africans themselves shake off these vices, though we may succeed in establishing civilization in isolated parts, as in this colony, Africa as a country can never rise. It should, then, be the object of every patriotic African to stimulate his countrymen in the acquirement of those talents which have raised other countries, and not to encourage native indolence or presumption.\n\nIt is with feelings of deep regret we have to record the death of one of the most respected and influential of Sierra Leone native merchants, W. H. Pratt, Marshal of the Vice-Admiralty Court, &c., &c., who died at his residence, Palm Villas, on the night of Tuesday, the 21st February, 1865, aged sixty-two years. The late Mr. Pratt, who was very earnest in his endeavours for the advancement of Africa in industry, civilization, and Christianity, was an ardent supporter of the _African Times_, the beneficial influence of which in African affairs, and on opinions in and respecting Africa and the Africans, he warmly recognised. We beg to express our sympathy with his family and friends, by whom he seems to have been greatly beloved and appreciated.

It is not at all absurd to hope that the reports of his men who had made this personal contact with and inspection of our civilization might induce him to do what we wish him to do. But, no—""whenever the King of Dahomey renounces the slave-trade, gives up human sacrifices, and commences in real earnest the pursuit of legitimate trade,"" then, and not till then, ""it will be time to consider his proposal"" to be allowed to send some of his subjects—his nobles—to England. When he has made so much progress in civilized ideas that the visit of his people to England will have become comparatively unimportant, then they may come. If there were not great interests of humanity, civilization, and Christianity at stake, we might laugh at the absurdity; but when we look at the results to be obtained by the civilization of Dahomey and of Ashantee, and see such a policy as that under consideration announced from England, our heart almost fails within us. Those two countries are being annually drenched with the blood of victims of an atrocious barbarism, and that blood flows, for the most part, not because of a wanton exercise of a savage despotic power, but at the behests of a most sanguinary superstition. And we prefer to cure these people by offering them the bribe, that if they will first become good, and righteous, and humane, and enlightened in their ideas, some half-a-dozen or more of them shall really be brought over to England to have the honour of a peep at us! If they will swallow our pill first, we will, perhaps, give them (""it will be time to consider his proposal"") a little jam and honey afterwards. And this is the way in which our Government, as a Government, thinks that African civilization may be accomplished. The English people, as individuals, know better. They do not say to the poor wretched victims of a cherished barbarous superstition, cast off your false religion, acknowledge two or three of the great truths of Christianity, and then we will see, perhaps, what can be done for you. No, they send their missionaries to tell them what Christianity is—to show them the difference between what it inculcates, and the bloody system under which they have been for so many ages the benighted victims. And why does not the English Government act on the same principles? Does official position, does official life, remove the members of a Government out of the sphere altogether of the principles and sentiments which would influence and govern them as individual Englishmen? It seems very much like this. We cannot send our civilization to Dahomey and Ashantee for them to look at it and contrast it with their own barbarism, as missionaries can show them the simple truths of Christianity, and ask them to compare them with the foul teachings of their Fetish priests. All the sample of civilization we can send them, after having encouraged their sanguinary systems for ages by our long and active prosecution of the slave-trade on their coasts, is war ships and cannon engaged in protecting legitimate trade, and putting down that slave-trade we so long encouraged and participated in; that according to the ideas of those people, we have only abandoned it because we do not want it any longer, and, like dogs in the manger, refuse to let others eat of what we do not ourselves require. Traders, eager, of course, as traders must be, in the pursuit of gain, ""guns, drums, trumpets, blunderbuss, and thunder,"" war ships, and an occasional missionary, are all the show of civilization we can make to them in their own lands. The mountain cannot go to Mahomet, but Mahomet can be brought to the mountain. We cannot extend civilization and its fruits to the Dahoman and Ashantee anywhere but in England. They begin to know and feel this, and are not at all so unreasonable as we are. They do not say, send England over here that we may look at it, but, take us over to England that we may see what it is. And we want them to see it, or, at least, we ought to want them to see it. What is there, then, that stands in the way? There is no doubt in our own mind on the subject. It would cost a thousand pounds or two, and a little trouble, to gratify their wish. And so this great and noble nation takes refuge under a false and hypocritical exaction. And, of course, it does not expect to be found fault with. What can be better than the things it asks the Dahoman to do? Renounce the slave-trade, give up human sacrifices, buy cottons, guns, powder, and rum, and sell palm-oil and such other articles as your country produces! Who can find fault with this? Not we; only the demand or advice is not likely to be granted or acted upon. The people want an adequate motive for the change demanded. We try to give them one when we endeavour by our ships to make it impossible for them to sell slaves for export. And they understand this motive, because they feel the power of its working. Why not add another motive? Why not show them England and its civilization? Have we no faith in ourselves, or our civilization, or our religion, so that we fear their being too closely looked at by strange eyes? No, it is not this, it is that ignoble motive of a little money, as if civilised Dahomey and Ashantee would not repay it to the country ten thousand times over. Away with it.

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs. It shows nice powers of observation—great diligence—a clear appreciation of facts, and a mental daring that does not shrink from the great problems of the future of the various divisions of his race, on which the light of Christian civilisation is only now beginning to shine, and who are for the most part placed under circumstances most unfavourable to its increase. After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries. Showing us their actual condition, and exposing many errors of administration which are opposed to material development and social advancement, he views the whole in connexion with the resolutions of the late House of Commons Committee, 1865, recommending the preparing of the several people for self-government. He shows the great changes that must be induced and fostered to make such self-government possible, safe, or beneficial. Though he has evidently a deep and, we believe, a just faith in his race, he does not shut his eyes to any of the disadvantages of their actual position and the difficulties in the way of their progress toward Christianity, civilisation, and wealth.

Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care.

The African-Aid Society and the African Times have never spoken out more strongly than this. Truth will make its way, in spite of prejudice and jealousy. The ""native who returned from the Brazils,"" and who was sent out to Abeokuta under the auspices of the African-Aid Society, gives a faint foreshadowing of the material advancement in Africa that will some day result from the return of the African race in America to the lands of their forefathers. Had not some of the missionary body in Abeokuta opposed the sending of such people from America by the African-Aid Society, many brick and tile makers, and other valuable artisans, might now have been established there. We are glad to see that a change is coming over the spirit of our friends in that place. America will soon have many choice workmen and agriculturists from among its emancipated slaves, ready to bring their industrial knowledge to the assistance of the land of their forefathers.

What he effected was all his own—all the fruit of his own labour, utilizing the elements placed at his disposal by the Christian philanthropy of Great Britain. The Church Missionary Society may record his name with pride as among the fruit of their persistent labours in West Africa; and Her Majesty's Government had certainly no cause to regret having taken him into the medical ranks of the Army, in which he attained to the high position of Surgeon-Major, and from which he retired last year, after a full period of service, but without receiving the decoration of St. Michael and St. George, which could only have been withheld because he was an African.

The very atmosphere was electric with the most wonderful schemes—religious, philanthropic, and commercial—for the exclusive benefit of the negro. From platform and pulpit rose a clamour of voices, in which was heard the popular watchwords of the day—civilisation, progress, the good of the negro, legitimate commerce, conversion of the heathen, and other high-sounding phrases, all having relation to the good things to be done for the African. The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation. They never heard now of the trader who went to Africa with the merely selfish object of making his fortune. Each and all became pioneers of civilisation, thinking only of the native first and self afterwards. They spoke as if the good to the native had been enormous, and that their intercourse with him had been a benefit and blessing. They pointed with pride to their sacrifices in the suppression of the slave trade, to their West Coast settlements as centres of secular light and leading; to their missionary stations as stars twinkling in the night of heathendom; to the returns of their trade with every entrance to the heart of Africa, as showing the spread of their beneficial influence. They saw that the work of other nations had been pernicious in the extreme, that they had been brutal in their dealings with native races, and had thought only of their own sordid interests and national aggrandisement—all in marked contrast to their aims and methods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""To religion, therefore, we owe the improvement of our minds; to civilization we look for the improvement of our outward circumstances.

A general view would embrace every particular view, and the friend of Africa in general, would be found the friend of Africa in particular.\n\nI have been much struck with the similarity of feature presented by Africa in general.

With ignorance there have been found selfishness and cruelty, and regard for human life has been scarcely perceptible anywhere. With the white man's knowledge came also the white man's sins; and as with individuals men will be found to imitate the bad example rather than the good, so has it been with Africa in general, since only in the parts as yet unvisited by the white man is the black man found in his native simplicity and ignorance; whilst in all other parts he has acquired cunning, deceit, and mistrust.\n\nThe means originally adopted for the improvement (if improvement it could be called) of newly-discovered Africa had presently and ultimately in view gain. The possessions of the black man were coveted and craftily obtained; the black man's body even was made the subject of barter and exchange, with the object of his working for the white man's use, as cattle bought in market overt. No wonder, then, that the influence of the white man over the black was evil instead of good; and the improvement of Africa had subsequently to be effected through the removal of that mistrust and deceit which the white man's conduct had produced. Trade can be legitimate as well as beneficial. Had this been practically shown in Africa, who can calculate the enormous benefit which the white man's influence in Africa would, ere this, have brought. Some men's sins go before to judgment, and some they follow after. Transgressors go not without the punishment due to their offence, but those who follow them have the effect of their transgressions to overcome, ere they can be placed in the position they occupied before such offence was committed. Other means were doubtlessly adopted, and ultimately Christianity was brought to bear only where all these means had failed.

Slaves are sold by the hundreds and the thousands, and where are these thousands of criminals of Burton\'s to be obtained? Why, this question is answered by the yearly expedition of the King of Dahomey, who falls by night upon a defenceless city, panyarres the whole inhabitants, and sells them as slaves. Ninety-nine-hundredths of the slaves sold are obtained by war expeditions, and it is worse than nonsense to say after they have been liberated, that they were ""the vilest of criminals in their own lands.""\n\nThe great drawback for the African is that there is no field in Africa for him in which to prosecute and put to a more practical use the knowledge he has obtained; he has no learned society to go to, and he has not sufficient money to continue independent researches; so that when he comes out to the Coast, he turns all his attention to the making of a livelihood; and he meets with discouragements everywhere he turns.

1228,"The African Times played a crucial role in promoting and supporting African development initiatives by using media to raise awareness, manage donations, and mobilize support for philanthropic activities.","The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present differing perspectives on the role of the African Times in promoting and supporting African development initiatives. The General History of Africa does not specifically attribute philanthropic functions to the African Times, instead focusing on the broader use of media by nationalist leaders to disseminate anti-colonial and nationalist ideas, criticize the colonial system, and promote political and social organizations. This absence of information about the African Times' involvement in philanthropic activities contrasts with the detailed accounts from The African Times news articles. These articles provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that the publication played a crucial role in promoting and supporting African development initiatives. They highlight the African Times' efforts to raise awareness and manage donations for the African-Aid Society, including detailed lists of subscriptions and donations from various individuals and organizations. The publication actively solicited support from both African and European audiences, emphasizing the importance of financial contributions to sustain its operations and initiatives. Additionally, the African Times served as a platform for voicing African grievances and advocating for improvements in governance and infrastructure, thereby mobilizing support for philanthropic activities.

In the meantime, Turner visited South Africa in 1898, consecrated Dwane as AME vicar-bishop and pro› claimed the intention of the Church to build an AME College second to none among 'previous missionary educational endeavors'.

The founding faculty would come from African students already studying at Wilberforce University, Morris Brown College, Howard University, and the Medical Department of Central State College at Nashville, Tennessee.\nThe issue of non-African direction and dominance in the Church move› ment proved, however, unendurable for Dwane. In 1899, he seceded from the AME-'Ethiopian' union and thus created a schism within the ranks of the black Church in South Africa. Trying to retrieve its missionary foothold in South Africa, the AME General Conference in 1900 appointed Levi Coppin as the first Resident Bishop. The Church, moreover, was aided in its work by Charlotte Manye, the Sotho student who had triggered the AME-Ethiopian affiliation in the first place. Manye returned from her American studies in 1901 and immediately picked up the South African College idea - by founding an AME mission school among the Pedi in the Eastern Cape. By 1908, Charlotte Manye Maxeke and her spouse had obtained enough money from the Missionary Department to buy land in Transvaal, build a hall (named after Bishop Coppin) and to move the school (now named Wilberforce Institution) to its permanent location at Evaton."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Pan-Africanism: political and cultural aspects', 'content': ""In addition, a series of annual graduation exercises, called 'African Rhetoricals' were organized at Tuskegee to respond to specific African agenda needs such as the raising of funds to support a Tuskegee Chapel in Liberia.

Indeed, by the end of the First World War, Garvey's militant newspaper, The Negro World under the editorship of Hubert Harrison, a Caribbean journalist living in New York - struck a responsive chord among the black masses in New York, throughout North America, and in Africa. Garvey's message to all was: organize, buy black, support the Black Star Steamship Line (which could take black emigrants to Africa and bring back raw materials), and help drive whites out of Africa. He stressed that: We are the descendants of a suffering people. We are the descendants of a people determined to suffer no longer ... We do not desire what has belonged to others, though others have always sought to deprive us of that which belonged to us ... The other races have countries of their own and it is time for the 400,000,000 Negroes [of the world] to claim Africa for themselves. 55 Whereas Du Bois was a greater pan-African force among black intellectuals outside Africa, and Washington was better known among rural artisan classes, Garvey's influence fell equally upon the submerged black masses of all strata both outside and inside Africa. Garvey received much of his own pan-Africanist inspiration from the Egyptian intellectual, Duse Muhammad Ali, while in England in 1912 and from reading, also in London, Washington's autobiography, Up From Slavery.\nInitially organized around the idea of setting up a Tuskegee-type school in Jamaica, Garvey's UNIA became the organizational link between large numbers of Africans and American blacks outside Africa, and, through The Negro World, achieved substantial pan-African effect within Africa. Between 1920 and 1938, eight UNIA conventions were held. The first five, with Garvey in charge, were held in New York City in August of each year from 1920 to 1924, the next two, following Garvey's deportation from the United States, took place in Jamaica in 1929 and 1934, and the eighth and last, in Canada, in 1938."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.612, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Christian missionary activities', 'content': 'In Southern Africa, even greater attention was paid to education than in other parts of Africa, thanks partly to the grants-in-aid that were given by the governments of the Cape and Natal during the period.

The Glasgow Missionary Society, for instance, established a seminary at Lovedale in Natal in July 1841 to which an industrial department was attached. This taught masonry, carpentry, waggon-making and smithing, and from 1861 on, printing and book-binding.$^{19}$ The Roman Catholics had also established a convent of the Sisters of the Holy Family with a boarding school, primary school and home of refuge in Natal and another one in the Orange Free State by 1877.

For example, one Captain Dean, early in the twentieth century, hoped to engineer the settlement of American blacks in South Africa to fashion a powerful black state there. After the briefest sojourn meant to arrange for this settlement, however, white authorities expelled Dean from the Cape for what were termed 'provocative activities'. And in 1914, Chief Alfred C. Sam, a Gold Coast African, turned up in Oklahoma, persuaded about sixty black farmers that Africa offered them greater oppor› tunities and sailed with them to Saltpond in the Gold Coast.

This fortuitous train of events led to the dispatch of an Ethiopianist delegation, headed by Reverend James Mata Dwane, to the United States in 1896, and culminated in the formal absorption of the 'Ethiopian' Church by the AME and the formal entry of the AME Church into the foreign missionary field.\nSpecifically, Dwane pressed Afro-Americans to come to South Africa and to push the educational mission of the AME Church, arguing that South Africa offered 'educated and consecrated American Negroes their greatest field of usefulness'.$^{30}$ For the time being, however, it would be necessary for the mother Church to help out by training African youth in American educational institutions. Bishop Turner responded by placing a cryptic notice of advice in his paper, The Voice of Missions: 'Take Notice, Wilberforce.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.611, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 422, 'article_title': 'SIERRA LEONE INDUSTRIAL EXHIBITION FUND', 'full_section_title': 'SIERRA LEONE INDUSTRIAL EXHIBITION FUND', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1864#article-8', 'issue_date': '23_08_1864', 'content': ""The Council of the African-Aid Society earnestly invite all the friends of African progress to send them subscriptions to this fund, which will be advertised monthly in the _African Times_.\n\nSubscriptions may be sent either to the London and Westminster Bank, St. James's-square, London, S.W., or to F.

Our aim in the future will ever be, as it has been in the past, to make it practically useful; and we again solicit the support of all who have at heart the real welfare of native Africa and its people, both for this Journal and for the Society by which it was founded, and to whose efforts with Government and individuals so much of its power for good may be attributed. And more especially do we commend the African Times and the African-Aid Society to the warm and earnest support of the educated Africans of the West Coast. The African Times brings them, as well as their rulers, face to face with British public opinion, by which they have much to gain in the work to which we hope they all feel themselves pledged—viz., that of the Christian civilization of the whole African people, and the industrial development of those great natural resources with which Africa has been so liberally endowed.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-07-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_07_1865#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Editorial', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'COMMENCING with the present number, the size of the African Times is permanently increased to sixteen pages.

During that period the whole of the anxiety, labour, and responsibility, both public and pecuniary, which it has involved, have been borne by one individual, the Editor. When first started, he undertook, subject to the condition of a certain number of copies being subscribed for individually by some members of the Council of the African-Aid Society, that it should never involve that society in any pecuniary loss or responsibility. Contrary to his opinion as to the conditions under which a public journal could be successfully conducted, and submitted to by him solely with the object of facilitating its establishment, a committee of a few members of the council of that society was appointed to meet monthly, prior to its publication, for considering the articles, &c., which the Editor had decided to insert. But to this the Editor attached a stipulation that he would not consent to any alterations of which he did not himself fully approve, and which he did not consider advisable or innocuous. Such a committee of course could not work, and the Editor freed himself almost immediately from the nominal restriction, which only served to increase the difficulty of bringing out the paper on the proper day, without effecting any useful purpose whatever. A perfect and entire independence of thought and opinion in the editor is essential to the success of any and every public journal. During five years, therefore, the whole labour and responsibility have, as before stated, rested with one individual, the present Editor. Such an anniversary as this is therefore a solemn one with us. The objects the Editor has endeavoured ever to keep in view have been the promotion of good government in the British African colonies and settlements, to force a removal of official abuses, to promote material development and increased facilities of transit and trade, as auxiliaries to missionary effort, and as indispensable, not to the reception of Christianity, but to the existence and spread of Christian civilization in Africa. Having entered upon this work with a deep sense of responsibility to God, we feel bound to ask ourselves how that work has been performed. With the measure and extent of its success we have nothing to do, that we leave in the hands of Him who worketh through individual agencies on the earth, according to His own infinite wisdom. But have we done our duty by the African people, and have they, on their side, done their duty towards us? As regards the former, we can only look to our motives and our desires. We have endeavoured to keep a watchful guard over ourselves as ""one who must give an account before God,"" and we have, with no small sacrifice of time and rest, conscientiously striven to give to Africa in our labours whatever talent or wisdom God may have bestowed upon us for that purpose. As regards the latter, we think we have cause of rejoicing rather than of complaint. The number of our African subscribers has continuously increased, filling up, in a way most satisfactory to us, the gaps in our subscription list caused by the withdrawals of those of our early friends who considered, we suppose, that no further effort on their part was necessary to our support. And we have given a voice—a public voice to Africa. Few people in England, unfortunately, care much about her or her concerns. The English Anti-Slavery party, fully occupied in their high and noble object of the eradication of negro slavery everywhere, have not yet had time generally to recognise the importance of paving the way, and preparing for, and aiding in the work of Christian civilization in Africa itself.

As suggested earlier, the salient fact of the period is the expansion of both the trade and the production of the Sokoto caliphate, with vacant land being settled within the frontiers and 'Hausa' traders pushing into areas far beyond. In such conditions not only did the Hausa-based traders come into Borno, but Borno-based traders increasingly moved their centre of operation to Hausaland. The political and ideological dØtente between the two states per› mitted this; indeed the embargoes of the early part of the nineteenth century were exceptional when seen against the long tradition of Borno's western trade. But it does seem that Borno, in competition with the trade centres of the caliphate, had increasingly less to offer. An old staple like natron (sodium carbonate) was still exported, though it probably faced greater competition from other kinds of salt from elsewhere. Another staple export, captives, seems gradually to have declined; though it is possible that captives were increasingly used for work in Borno, the productive base of the Borno economy does not appear to have expanded at the rate the caliphate's expanded. Other exports or re-exports mentioned, like hides, skins, ivory or ostrich feathers, also passed along Hausa trade routes, and new sources of supply - e.g., ivory from Adamawa - were explored under the protection of the caliphate. In brief, it seems that Borno was being drawn into the caliphate's economy as a supplier of raw materials and as a consumer of luxuries, with less profit accruing to those in power than before. One symbol of this shift is the fact that Borno had at last become part of the west African cowrie currency zone by 1850; another is the difficulty traders had in collecting debts in the capital - perhaps the volume of trade could no longer carry such overheads - and North African traders became wary ofcoming to Borno. The Saharan trade had been an important element in al-Kânâmfs policies, and to this end Borno had regained control in the 1840s of Zinder, a major port of entry.

But soon the coastal traders were able to visit the other capitals. The exception here would be Rwanda and Burundi, where the rulers were able to keep coastal traders out of their region and develop successful tactics for coping with the guns used by their adversaries.$^{31}$ On the other hand, the rulers of Bunyoro were also struggling to attract traders to their capital. In the 1870s the king of Bunyoro, Kabarega, was trying to compete with Buganda in making direct contacts with Zanzibar, while at the same time trying to attract the 'Khartoumers' (traders coming down the Nile) who were raiding widely among the non-centralized societies bordering the kingdom on the northern side.$^{32}$ It was Buganda under Mutesa (1856-84) which seems to have gained most from the coastal trade. A centralized government with a disciplined bureaucracy had been established earlier. But the traffic in guns which Mutesa kept under his personal control further strengthened the centralized system. Buganda seems to have concentrated its attention more on the international trade than the regional network. Miitesa's raids on Busoga to the east, and his attacks on his western neighbours (Bunyoro, Toro, Nkore, Buhaya and Buzinza) ensured Buganda's predominance in the trade. At times, Mutesa even sought to control both Karagwe and Buzinza to ensure that coastal caravans could get to his capital without problems.\nClearly, in the Great Lakes region some of the larger kingdoms were greatly strengthened by their connections with the coastal traders.

Some of them were large and powerful while others were small and weak. But all of them had participated in a regional trade network whose routes connected most of the major capitals.

Less effective were embargoes on the export or import of items such as horses, weapons, salt or types of cloth, while an indiscriminate blockade of towns or areas was difficult to sustain, not least because smuggling offered high profits. But the disruption in the normal flow of caliphal trade caused for example by Ningi and Mbutawa raids was serious enough to require a remedy. Indeed their own experience of severe food shortages and the interruption of the grain trade during the djifiàd had made men like Muhammad Bello acutely aware of the importance of encouraging traders by keeping roads open, establishing markets and enforcing the laws regulating fair trading.

Around the 1840s, trade that relied on the use of the western routes declined while trade by way of the routes of the central Sahara thrived, especially between Tripoli and Kano and between Tripoli and Borno. In addition, a new direct link between Wadaïand Barka, discovered in 1809 or 18 10, became a major caravan route after 1850.93 During the latter half of the century the slave trade went into a slow decline, although along the Borno route it continued longer and along the Wadaï route it even increased and went on doing so after 1900.94 Ivory exports, which were fairly stable, peaked around 1877. The place of slaves as items of trade was taken first by ostrich feathers, mainly from 1878 to 1883, and then by hides, especially goatskins. To these were added fabrics dyed with indigo, from the Hausa country a small quantity ofgold and a few other sundry articles. English cotton goods were the main item to be carried southwards.

Other imports consisted of North African woollen garments from Tripolitania, Austro-Hungarian textiles, woollen goods and carpets, ironmongery, medicines, devotional articles, perfumes, jewellery, silks, pearls and above all, weapons and ammunition. In addition, there was a constant demand for salt from the Sahara, dates from oases and cereals from the Sahel. 95 Trans-Saharan trade did not undergo a decline until Atlantic shipping and overland transport (railways) in West Africa began to constitute com› petitive alternatives. Political developments played a secondary though important role. The fortunes of Wadai account for the importance of the Wadai-Barka route as early as 1850.

In both cases alliances between local mer› chants and foreign traders facilitated the circumvention of the royal mon› opoly and drastically weakened the position of the respective national leaders.$^{68}$ A similar pattern occurred in the kingdom of Kassanje, located in the adjacent territory of Angola. There the local matrilineages were able to gain control of the slave trade, at the expense of the royal family, leading to the rapid fragmentation of the state. 69 One by-product of greater commercial interaction was the substantial amount of cultural borrowing that occurred between different societies. The direction of change varied appreciably, depending on such factors as the nature and duration of contact between the trading groups and the host population. Where interaction was substantial, three broad patterns of acculturation occurred. In several instances, isolated bands of merchants and raiders became totally absorbed into the local society, as in the case of the Chikunda hunters, who were incorporated into Nsenga, Ambo and valley Tonga communities.$^{70}$ In sharply contrasting situations, the aliens profoundly altered the host culture. The Chewa subjects of Khota Khota, for example, absorbed aspects of Islam into their religion, adopted Swahili names, Swahili words and phrases, and underwent a major restructuring of their social system.$^{71}$ Similarly, many Yao traders converted to Islam and adopted coastal cultural patterns as a result of their contact with the Arabs. Their participation in long-distance trade also led to the growth of urban centres and the development of rituals and prohibitions designed to ensure the fidelity of Yao women while their husbands were in the interior, 72 suggesting that change also occurred as societies modified internal struc› tures to meet new external conditions. In addition to these two patterns of acculturation, there are indications that the fluid conditions facilitated the development of new ethnic and cultural groups. Several of the bands of Chikunda broke away from the decaying prazo system around the middle of the century and organized autonomous communities in the Luangwa valley. Attracting followers from a variety of disparate ethnic groups, they evolved a culture incorporating diverse Malawian and Shona institutions and values.$^{73}$ A parallel phenomenon occurred in the area of what is now eastern Zaire where the Manyema were transformed from a disparate band of slavers into a coherent social and cultural group. 74', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.629, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Omani penetration and the expansion of trade > The Mombasa hinterland routes', 'content': 'It appears that in the latter part of the nineteenth century, Arab and Swahili traders were strongly in control of the Kamba trade route. 16 This was because, having pushed through the Maasai country using the Kilimanjaro route (at a time when Maasai power was heavily affected by wars and epidemics), the coastal traders had been able to gain control of the sources of ivory. At this time, trade in slaves (which had not been prominent under the Kamba) seems to have become more important. Kamba traditions picture this as the most disruptive period in their history: disruptive famine led to inter-lineage conflicts that were used by ambitious members of society to sell weaker ones to Arabs.$^{17}$ Kamba traditions, therefore, rightly indicate the relationship between the decline of trade in goods in which they themselves played a major part and the rise of the system of profiteering in persons in which the Arabs and Swahili traders played a prominent role.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The new changes resulted from a combination of factors, including the nineteenth-century wars which, as in Yorubaland, had the effect of ren› dering the coastal areas relatively safe and attractive to migration from the hinterlands in which most of the fighting took place; the sea-borne trade which was rendered permanent by the transition from slave to 'legitimate' trade, thereby conferring a definite economic advantage on the coastal regions; and the steady growth of European interest, which enlarged the traditional role of selected coastal towns such as Lagos, Porto Novo and eventually Cotonou to take on new and increasing responsibilities not only as ports but also as political capitals of emergent colonial states and their independent African successors.\nIn all these changes, however, the economic factor would appear to have been the most dominant, especially with reference to the European presence. Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa.

The other route moved towards Mount Kilimanjaro and joined up with the Pangani valley route.

Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

His worshippers seem to have forgotten what atrocities he had committed. The reason why they are opposed to the Soninkee Government was, that at certain times the people generally came to the factors and begged or demanded certain articles from them, and if refused in an obstinate manner, they considered it an insult to them, as the factors were occupying the ground of their fathers. The affray then generally terminated by the traders receiving a good flogging, and being made to pay a larger demand. I do not wonder at this being complained of; but if the traders were polite and obliging to them, and showed them that the goods did not really belong to the traders, at the same time making them small presents, they generally returned double the amount in a few days in cattle.\n\nWhen Badiboo was under the Soninkee Government, traders from every part of the country came down to trade in it, as it is situated near the large and populous kingdom of Salom. At Badiboo are the best cotton and phangs, numerous bandy cloth, and an immense quantity of ground-nuts; so much so, that Badiboo, under the government of the Soninkees, produced more nuts than any other kingdom on the River Gambia. The principal ground-nut marts were Swarak, Cindah, Bany, Kintak Cundah, and Sabaj. In these towns kola are sold in great abundance for phangs, and afterwards exchanged for ground-nuts, from which the petty traders derive great benefit.\n\nThe people at Badiboo are an intermixture of Jollof, Mandigo, and Foolahs, and from them the people at Bathurst receive yearly several head of cattle, with some fresh butter, corn, and rice. Although the Soninkees are universally considered to be lazy, yet still the lower class are hard-working, and when a Soninkee chief has rule over Marabouts, it is his general practice to compel them to work, so as to pay him a portion of their earnings. But when Mahaba became chief, trade almost ceased, the people in the interior being afraid to come down, as their property would not be secured from the ravages of Mahaba's people. The Cabuncas, who occupy an extensive region in the interior of Badiboo, reaching to Rio Nunez, on the other hand, were in the habit of coming down by land to Tenderbar, and from there cross over to Badiboo for the express purpose of purchasing horses and phangs, but they have since been afraid to do so.""}, {'id': 4353, 'article_title': ""A Snubbed Colony—Dr. Gouldsbury's Expedition"", 'full_section_title': ""A Snubbed Colony—Dr. Gouldsbury's Expedition"", 'last_edit_date': '11-20-1881', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_01_1882#article-2', 'issue_date': '02_01_1882', 'content': ""Sir S.

In this paper the author described his impressions of the lower part of the Niger and of the Central Soudan acquired in the course of a commercial and political mission last year to the Sultans of Sokoto and Gandu. On his way along the West Coast of Africa he noted the influence for good or evil which contact with white men has had upon the natives, and concluded that while there is much we have reason to be proud of, there is still more of which we ought to feel ashamed. He expressed the opinion that for every negro the missionaries have influenced for good by Christian teaching, a thousand had been driven into deeper degradation by other influences. He also found the settlements absurdly over-governed on a system totally unsuited to the peculiarities of barbarous races. That part of the Niger which the author traversed is divided into three sections according to their physiographical features—(1) the delta, (2) the low-lying region between the delta and the coast mountains, and (3) the irregular valley which has been cut out of the interior plateau. On reaching Lokoja, at the confluence of the Benué with the Niger and the commencement of the third section, the Central Soudan is entered. The changes which occur here, whether physiographical or ethnological, are striking in the extreme. ""Behind us are the unwashed, barbarous *sans culottes* of the coast region, with fetishism, cannibalism, and the gin bottle in congenial union; before us lies a people astir with religious activity and enthusiasm, and wonderfully far advanced in the arts and industries."" Mr. Thomson took occasion to point out the enormous influence for good—though not unmixed—which Mahomedanism exercises among the inhabitants of the Central Soudan. On reaching Rabba in the Kupé country the river journey ended, and the journey to Sokoto had to be continued by means of the ordinary African caravan. The difficulties with the porters were described and the countries traversed were sketched, the route being through Kupé and Yauri to the Gulbi-n-Gindi, which is then followed to the neighbourhood of Sokoto. In conclusion, the author described the commercial prospects of these parts. He expressed the opinion ""that in all the wide range of tropical Africa there is no more promising field for commerce than this semi-civilized region which forms the central area of the Niger basin."" He came to this conclusion not on the ground that it is more fertile or more rich in natural productions—though in those respects comparing favourably with other parts—but for other reasons. These may be briefly summarized as follows: (1) It is more densely populated than any other part of Africa, and divided into powerful and, in Africa, exceedingly well-governed empires, in which life and property are almost as sacred as in Great Britain. (2) The peoples are far advanced in civilization, and throughout Northern Africa are famed for the excellences of their various manufactures. (3) The necessary machinery and organization to work the inland trade is ready to hand, as the Houssa trader is famed for his commercial genius and enterprising spirit. (4) An efficient transport service already exists, as the horse, camel, bullock, and donkey flourish in their thousands. (5) Owing to the much sterner conditions under which the people live, labourers are to be found without stint.

He seems to consider that the chief Mahabah is performing a duty which the Government neglected to do, and for doing which it envies the man who is really performing very important public services, and preparing the way for the progressive civilization of the country. That man, Mahabah, he says, is not seeking his own interests only, but that of all British subjects. British merchants have been without any real, efficient protection in the river of late years, and Mahabah has made a vast improvement in this respect during the last 24 months. It is true, he proceeds, that, partly owing to the war, and partly to the famine that prevailed during the rainy season, there has been a great deficiency of produce, ""but it is far better to prepare the ground before sowing seed, than to sow it in unprepared soil."" The Pagsoos, in this river, are a people that do not work, but who go about plundering those who do work; pillaging the merchants and traders, and committing many other and great enormities. They are, in fact, a lazy, predatory, and degraded people. The late war between the British and Badiboo was caused by such deeds as are above alluded to. The British effected really nothing, but Mahabah has made an entire change. These people, before so troublesome, having been brought by him under subjection, are now learning to depend on their own labour for the means of support; so that British merchants, who previously scarcely dared to commission any traders in that part, have now been able to find employment as traders there for those who have been (so arbitrarily, as he contends) dismissed from the Government service.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-02-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1864#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.617, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Policy of Non-Intervention in Western Africa: Its Mischievous Tendency on the Good Government of the Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The political horizon of British Gambia is by no means in a satisfactory state; clouds are gathering from a quarter which ordinary men regard as a menace to the peace of the river. A glance at the past will show us what we may expect in the future, and also how to deal with it.\n\nMahba, King of Badiboo, formidable alike to all the native kings and to the French and to the English Government, sent last September a menacing despatch (in Arabic) to Colonel D'Arcy, the officer administering the Government of the Gambia, very warlike in its tone, and by subsequent actions violated all existing treaties. He detained all the British traders within the kingdom of Badiboo, with their goods and chattels, not allowing one man to leave the place, and also prevented all ingress into Badiboo, thus putting a stop to the trade of an extensive country, whose yearly quota of ground-nuts and hides adds greatly to the revenue of the colony. What was the *casus belli*?\n\nThe ostensible cause of this warlike and menacing attitude was, that a woman with a few children* availed themselves of Mahba's temporary absence from his capital, and made their escape to the British town of Bathurst. He at once sent to Colonel D'Arcy that, unless the woman and children were delivered up, all friendly diplomatic relation must stop, and trade cease, and the ports of Badiboo must, consequently, be considered closed to English merchants.\n\nBut the real cause, to all those who have studied the character of these Marabouts, inhabitants of the River Gambia, is to be found in that ambitious, overbearing, and covetous disposition of the Mussulmans, who view with discontent the rich prize they would obtain, could they have an opportunity of making one midnight raid on the rich Babboo Christian merchants at Bathurst. The toleration of this overbearing disposition of the Marabout chieftains in the River Gambia will always lead to serious complications; they must be made to understand that the British Government, although desirous of peace, yet still will never tolerate any nonsense from them.\n\nWe have not as yet forgotten the outrageous attack of Mahfal, the Commander-in-Chief of south-eastern Badiboo, on towns in British grounds, which led to the battle of Zoobabocolong; and at present, if reports from traders are correct, the greater part of Mahba's force is threatening Albreda.

Unfortunately for us perhaps there does not exist that co-operation which might tend to open up some of these districts, nor the capital necessary for doing so, in the Settlement itself; commerce therefore kept within a circumscribed area and every day increased by new establishments has arrived at a stage which may safely be described as a perfect commercial deadlock. Whether or not it has been wise for so many to enter into trade, is a question which to-day it would be useless to discuss; since the evil, if evil it is, already exists and cannot be undone; to find outlets for the superabundant commercial population is therefore the only remedy that presents itself.

Beyond the Gallinas Country there lies that hitherto unknown tract of country, but lately penetrated by His Excellency Sir Samuel Rowe, known as the Barrie Country; seldom, if ever, before visited by Europeans and hardly ever by Sierre Leone traders. The position of its principal town Dandazuma as a trading centre renders it of such importance to the commercial community that it cannot but be said to be peculiarly fortunate that it has been opened to commerce in these trying times. From it there are roads to the Tuonchia country rich in palm kernels and palm oil, the Wenday and Gowrah and other districts beyond as yet uninvaded by traders; it is within easy access of both Yonnie and Mesmah in the Kittam and is not very distant from Sulymah. Rich in produce which its people would gladly exchange for European products it is undoubtedly one of the finest markets which has for some time presented itself, and which, it is to be hoped, now that peace has been restored to the district and it has been opened to the traders of all nationalities, will not long remain undeveloped. It is said that not far inland of it, is a district known as the Conyah country, where horses run wild, and everything is plentiful; in time, perhaps, enterprising men of commerce might tap even this region from it; at present however to get in the thin end of the wedge in the Barrie country at Bandazum is what is required and that which awaits to be done. —Sierra Leone Church Times.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1885#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.611, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'RIVER GAMBIA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Grievous complaints have been made by the several traders doing business on this river of the great want of Government protection. How long are they to remain under subjection to the heathen chiefs and Mohammedan alcaldes, without any one to inquire into, or obtain them redress for, the cruel treatment received by them from those native authorities? The traders on this river are constantly exposed to great danger and loss owing to this want of Government protection. They are compelled by the chiefs and alcaldes to reside in their towns or stockades with their goods and produce. Formerly they built temporary stores and dwelling-houses at the river side or wharf of their several trading ports, by which they had little comparative risk from fire and native wars, the two chief accidents in this river. Of late that system has been done away with in some localities, through Government mismanagement, and the traders have sustained great losses; their goods and produce have in several places been consumed by fires, with the towns where they were compelled to reside, which would not have been the case had they been allowed to reside at the river side. This year the trade has been so dull, that cotton goods scarcely sold, and the very small portion of produce collected has been ultimately destroyed by fire; some thousand pounds worth at Sanding, some hundreds at Zambakotto, Juronku, Dassilammee, and Secker, and several other places—all by fire. Why should the traders be thus exposed, by being compelled to live in native towns, which are always taking fire, when this river, from the mouth to its source, is supposed to be under the management and control of the British Government?

In 1861 he was an unimportant chief in the kingdom of Baddiboo, against which the last great war expedition of the British authorities in the Gambia was directed. Maba was a bigoted Mahometan, and watching his opportunity, he in 1861 rebelled against the King of Baddiboo, whom he put to death, raising himself to be supreme ruler of Baddiboo. He then declared a propaganda of Mahometanism, which he endeavoured to force by fire and sword in all the adjacent countries. His last recorded exploit was a successful attack upon some 300 French troops (Europeans), who were all slain except nine, the officer in command putting an end to his own existence.\n\nThe last French mail from Senegal brought to Europe the intelligence that this restless and cruel fanatic chief has at last met with the fate he has constantly provoked. He was therein stated to have been taken prisoner in battle by the Joloffe King of Sein, and by him put to death, his head and hands being sent by the Joloffe King to the French Governor of Senegal.\n\nBy the mail of the 2nd inst. from Bathurst we have a confirmation of this important news. As we are not of those who believe that the forcible spread of Mahometanism in Africa (and it never spreads in any other way) is desirable, we unfeignedly rejoice that this great warrior-chief, for such he undoubtedly was, exists no more to trouble the Gambia countries. He has interfered very much with the development of the ground-nut cultivation, on which the trade in the Gambia chiefly depends, and many British traders up the river have suffered severely in the troubles he was constantly exciting, and the wars he was as constantly waging; and we hope now to hear of a new era of trading prosperity there which may compensate them for their losses, and promote the spread of civilisation in those important countries.

It stands in the centre of a great number of roads, radiating north, south, east, and west; it is the chief entrepôt for commerce in these parts, and it is in direct communication with Timbuctoo itself. I was at Kontampo when the caravan came in from Timbuctoo. There were at least 1,000 people, and probably fifty camels, and 300 or 400 asses, as well as mules and horses. The goods are brought to the town chiefly on asses, and, though camels are used, the goods being made up in small parcels, the donkeys are preferred as being a more convenient beast of burden. I found that European goods made their way to the town partly through the French settlement at Assinie, the goods being sent that way because they are able thereby to avoid crossing Ashantee. But among the merchandise brought by the Timbuctoo caravan were plenty of pieces of silks and cottons, as well as knives, sewing-cotton, coloured yarn, needles, brass pins, and other goods of European make. The great drawback to the trade with the interior has been the existence of the Ashantee State, which stretched like a Chinese Wall between our settlement and the back country. All goods passing through Ashantee were charged 100 per cent. transit duty, besides being detained for a month at Coomassie en route. This tariff was practically destructive of all commerce, and thus the background beyond Ashantee has never been opened up to British trade.

If this were done, a great African market, having communications with all the Mussulman States of the interior, would be brought into immediate proximity to Liverpool and London.

Yarburtenda is the highest port for trade now on the Gambia. Twenty miles above that place are the rapids of Burmeoonda, which, of course, put a stop to navigation by vessels, but are open for large canoes or lighters, and the river could be worked by these for nearly 200 miles farther up, making Yarburtenda a base depot for the interior trade. This would leave about 400 miles of road to connect the Gambia with the Upper Niger by caravan. At the forks of the Gambia, about ninety miles by water above Yarburtenda, is the town Jellacotta, which is most favourably situated as a centre of trade, and from which both branches of the Upper Gambia could be worked; and the water traffic on the road to Sego could be carried on 100 miles further, by the south-west branch; or, taking the direct land route to Sego, the road goes from Jellacotta to Bady, from there to Badoo, then to Banniseralie, then on to Kamalia, and touches the Upper Niger at Yammina, about twenty miles above Sego. It was across this line of country that Mungo Park travelled. Jellacotta can be reached from Yarburtenda by road across country, distance sixty miles, but, of course, the river is the best mode of transit.

Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.715, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'The educational impact of the Americas', 'content': 'When African students lived in America during the colonial period, they created the context for a different relationship between Africans and AfroAmericans and between African students themselves drawn from all over the African continent.

The reputation and resources of Tuskegee, however, were brought to Africa by African and American alumni and, often, by numerous African visitors to Tuskegee or correspondents with Washington who had never been matriculated students.

As Professor Lucy Mair and a number of other scholars have shown, some gained entry into that class because they had made money from either large-scale farming or business and could help to finance the political agitation of their better educated but poorer brethren.$^{6}$ Some cotton and coffee farmers of Uganda, cocoa farmers of western Nigeria and the Gold Coast, coffee farmers of Ivory Coast and groundnut farmers of Senegal and The Gambia were able to gain membership of the new elite class on grounds of their success in that profession. Similarly, in West Africa especially, where many indifferently educated Africans were able to interpose themselves as middlemen between the primary producers and the big European commercial companies, commercial success also provided a ready passport to the new elite status. There were, however, others who qualified for consideration as members of the elite because they controlled mass organizations like labour unions and could give the better-educated elite the kind of mass support which they needed to convince the colonial powers that they spoke for the people. On the contrary, in East and Central Africa relatively few Africans gained admission into the elite group as a result of the deliberate policies pursued by the colonial rulers and the activities of the Indians and Portuguese and Greek petty traders. In fact, in many of these areas, the old central elite virtually disappeared.\nIt is largely this wide variation in their qualifications and background that makes it so difficult to define precisely in those terms who were the new elite of colonial Africa. One can thus justifiably argue that the issue of the rise of a new elite among any African people in the colonial era was largely a question of what amount and kind of educational and economic opportunities were available to the people and how far they put those opportunities to effective use. All the studies so far carried out on this aspect of the matter suggest that regions or colonies which witnessed the most intensive efforts in the propagation of western education and which offered Africans more opportunities for meaningful participation in trade and commercial agriculture produced the largest number of people of elite status.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'The educational impact of the Americas', 'content': ""While travelling in West and Southern Africa with the Phelps-Stokes Commission and while lecturing in the Gold Coast as part of his Achimota appointment, Aggrey and several others in similar ways reached across many African communities and prompted dozens of African youth to seek an American rather than a British education.

Yet these aspects of African interaction with blacks of the diaspora do not wholly explain the activities of the Americaneducated Africans on their return home. Nor are they adequately explained in currently available scholarship. What appears to have occurred, particu› larly among Africans in British colonies, was an altered perspective of the American-educated African colliding with an inhospitable colonial reception (which was prompted by educational experiences completely outside the colonial orbit). 47 American education, however, was not universally or categorically opposed or disdained in the African colonies. Indications are that industrial or vocational training was welcomed by the colonial entrepreneur since it enabled him to secure well-trained artisans to drive motor lorries, build his houses, and manage his mechanical or electrical plant. Government officials and white missionaries encouraged this kind of training for different reasons: government officials because they believed that the commercial and economic development of the territory would be advanced, missionaries because they believed that Booker T.

Washington of South Africa', in a talk in New York City, explicitly affirmed the value for him of Washington's Tuskegee model.

Precepts for action are instilled in such lessons as ""Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might;"" and, above all examples, the life of Christ, who is first the Redeemer of the soul from sin, and then the great Teacher for every human action, is the one example in all that should be learned in these Christian schools. May we soon see the hands of those who are working, both in Africa and in England, strengthened for the commencement of carrying out this great movement! Its claims have been heard and responded to, but not sufficiently for the schools to be begun. Encouragement in the form of funds would fix the time, and labourers are ready to work in the vineyard. Soon, then, let us hope that the schools will be planted in Cape Coast Castle, and that girls and women shall press into them for the benefits of instruction they will afford. It must be a labour of faith as well as of love. ""Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."" Nothing yields a more plentiful harvest than seed sown for eternity, such as help and prayers that may be given to raise our needy and less advanced brethren and sisters in the scale of true Christianity, civilization, usefulness, and industry.'}, {'id': 4113, 'article_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA', 'full_section_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA', 'last_edit_date': '11-04-1880', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1881#article-6', 'issue_date': '01_01_1881', 'content': 'I hope, Sir, some abler pen than mine will take up this subject, and give it that treatment which its paramount importance justly deserves; and more than this, I would fain hope that all your able pleadings will result in some substantial aid being afforded from head-quarters to the cause of education on the Coast.\n\nAgain thanking you, Mr. Editor, for all your noble efforts on behalf of our country, and wishing you every good wish, I remain, yours, &c.,'}, {'id': 6090, 'article_title': '""Higher Education"" for West Africans', 'full_section_title': '""Higher Education"" for West Africans', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_05_1891#article-3', 'issue_date': '04_05_1891', 'content': 'We are pleased to learn that the subject of Higher Education is now engaging the attention of the good people on the West Coast; and we learn from a recent issue of the Lagos Times that a meeting was lately convened at the residence of Mr. Otonba Payne, Chief Registrar and Taxing Master of the Supreme Court, when Captain J.

I would just briefly state that in addition to Scriptural instruction in the truths of God's Holy Word, I am so anxious to secure for the poor African women and children instruction also in different branches of industrial knowledge, to render them in time better wives and mothers, and to create in them that legitimate ambition for home and domestic improvement and industry, which would go hand in hand with their moral and social elevation, and render them, I trust, please God, a truly happy, Christian, and prosperous population. Having for a short time sojourned amongst them, I have witnessed their great need in this respect; and have long mourned over my own individual inability in not being able to have sent them ere this the efficient means for establishing an institution of the character I have described to meet this great necessity. However, I do now trust, by the joint kindly and liberal help of English Christian hearts, we shall accomplish this important object, please God, for these poor African women and their little ones; as I cannot but feel that the aid and sympathy already elicited for this desired work is an earnest of greater and more effectual means to accomplish it ultimately.

His earnest desire is for the Christian education of the sons of the savage chiefs who border on Liberia. They are to be the future rulers of Africa.

If, as stated in my previous correspondence, such a school as the High-class School be amply and efficiently supported, it will prove a great boon to the place. That the educational work that is thus being inaugurated here needs such support as you have pleaded for will be evident from the fact that it has not been undertaken by the Church Missionary Society, as your remarks would seem to indicate, but by the sole efforts of some of the native residents of this place, who, sensible of the great educational wants of the community, have requested the Bishop of Sierra Leone to aid them in the establishment here of the Church of England with a properly-organized school; and the kind-hearted prelate, ever ready to lend a helping hand to every very good work, promised to aid their efforts in the undertaking. From this it will be seen that such needful help as you have advocated is a *sine qua non* in the proper development of education in this place; and should it be afforded, an efficient staff of competent teachers will be secured, and high-class schools, grammar schools, collegiate schools, and other seminaries of learning will be established along this Coast, which will undoubtedly be productive of unspeakable benefit to the country at large.

There is a demand for this; and since the Government has rendered very little help to educational work, it is right for us to expect that it would take up such a work earnestly. The people unaided are unable to provide themselves with such establishments. The practice has been adopted of sending young men and young women to England for education, but it is a very expensive one and is attended with a great risk, and comparatively very few persons can use it. The success that has attended it is one of a doubtful character. Some have returned home with enfeebled constitutions. English teachers have not generally been able to imbue the minds of their African scholars with patriotism, and a sense of their obligations and responsibility to their country. There has been too much of being wrapt up in self. Expensiveness and the fear of their succumbing to the effects of a foreign and trying climate have often necessitated a short stay, and placed them at a disadvantage. Colleges such as I have spoken of will be a boon to the whole Coast, and be hailed with gladness; and if, after successful residence in them, visits are made to England for a finishing, much good will, I think, be done thereby.\n\nIn this matter, as in that of elementary schools for the Gold Coast, the Government will find it most helpful to ask the aid and co-operation of the Church Missionary Society, that has already a very good foundation to work upon.

We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'West Coast Government', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'portance, the presence of a continually increasing number of African girls educated in some of the best schools in England.

A proper education meant an assimilation of the coloured man to the ideal of the white man, with regard to habits of mind and of thought.

With regard to the general question, which was viewed in many different ways by white people both in the colony and at home, he said the great desideratum of the hour in South Africa was to raise the discussion of important matters beyond the atmosphere of party.

Premising that he should confine himself principally to the state of affairs in the Cape Colony, the Lecturer said he should show that there had existed and did still exist in that colony a State scheme for the instruction of the natives in nearly everything they might require to know, whether it was to shoe a horse, make a wheel, or learn Greek. As he had himself endeavoured to instruct the Caffre in the Greek declensions, in his capacity as Government Lecturer in the colony, he might say that the loftiness and catholicity of the scheme had come home to him. Remarking upon the difficulties in the way of applying such a scheme in a sparsely-peopled savage country like South Africa, he said the number of white colonists at the Cape was about equal to the population of Leeds, and these had to legislate for the reclamation of more than a million blacks, who were scattered over an immense tract. Other difficulties lay in the unequal social developments among the black people, in the bi-lingual character of the white population, and in the want of unanimity on the part of the white colonists as to the proper lines upon which native education ought to go. To bring under one system of State education men of different religious views, hard though it might be, was an easy task for the political legislator compared with that encountered in an attempt to group under one plan men so intellectually and, if he might use the term, spiritually distinct as the European and the African aboriginal races. The difference between the races was, practically speaking, one absolutely of kind, not of degree. Undeterred by difficulties, legislators at the Cape had boldly grappled with the question, and they had established a complete educational ladder, with the kraal schools at the bottom and the university at the top. After going with some detail into the working of the scheme in that colony, and suggesting some possible improvements in the system, he remarked that though philanthropy in theory, in practice it was unphilosophic. A cardinal fact was ignored—the generic difference between the European and the Caffre. The principle of heredity was ignored. He was inclined to believe that the Caffre would be influenced by a simple and rather an autocratic system. Advocating a certain measure of compulsion in order to make the Caffre industrious, and to compel him to be taught, he said the educationist should walk hand in hand with the white magistrate and the missionary; these three classes of men really replace the autocracy of the chiefs. He thought that if the philanthropist could be persuaded to believe that all men were not equal, and if the Boer could be persuaded to believe that they might be equal in course of time—in fact, that there was a germ which might be worked upon in the native, there would be some chance of an agreement. If both philanthropist and Boer should take the scientific view that the Caffre was really nothing more than he was by descent, a savage pure and simple, but that he had in him the makings of a good citizen, there would be considerably less friction in South Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1884#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.623, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

Indications are that industrial or vocational training was welcomed by the colonial entrepreneur since it enabled him to secure well-trained artisans to drive motor lorries, build his houses, and manage his mechanical or electrical plant. Government officials and white missionaries encouraged this kind of training for different reasons: government officials because they believed that the commercial and economic development of the territory would be advanced, missionaries because they believed that Booker T.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools.

The fact was that for the non-Muslim areas of Africa probably the most important single innovation of foreign rule was literacy. Even for the Islamized areas, the coming of literacy in the Roman script gave a new impetus to Muslim education.

He believed that teachers and preachers in the quantity required by the African population should come from that school, thereby breaking the total reliance for missionary and teaching personnel on overseas schools. In the meantime, Turner visited South Africa in 1898, consecrated Dwane as AME vicar-bishop and pro› claimed the intention of the Church to build an AME College second to none among 'previous missionary educational endeavors'. Dwane, in turn, talked of establishing 'The Turner Normal School at Queenstown' or 'The Wilberforce of the Dark Continent'.\nTurner devoted the entire issue of Voice of Missions for March 1899 to publicity for the South African College Campaign.

Trying to retrieve its missionary foothold in South Africa, the AME General Conference in 1900 appointed Levi Coppin as the first Resident Bishop. The Church, moreover, was aided in its work by Charlotte Manye, the Sotho student who had triggered the AME-Ethiopian affiliation in the first place. Manye returned from her American studies in 1901 and immediately picked up the South African College idea - by founding an AME mission school among the Pedi in the Eastern Cape.

Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi. It was not until after the Second World War that technical schools and univer› sity colleges were established in most parts of Africa.

As Professor Lucy Mair and a number of other scholars have shown, some gained entry into that class because they had made money from either large-scale farming or business and could help to finance the political agitation of their better educated but poorer brethren.$^{6}$ Some cotton and coffee farmers of Uganda, cocoa farmers of western Nigeria and the Gold Coast, coffee farmers of Ivory Coast and groundnut farmers of Senegal and The Gambia were able to gain membership of the new elite class on grounds of their success in that profession. Similarly, in West Africa especially, where many indifferently educated Africans were able to interpose themselves as middlemen between the primary producers and the big European commercial companies, commercial success also provided a ready passport to the new elite status. There were, however, others who qualified for consideration as members of the elite because they controlled mass organizations like labour unions and could give the better-educated elite the kind of mass support which they needed to convince the colonial powers that they spoke for the people. On the contrary, in East and Central Africa relatively few Africans gained admission into the elite group as a result of the deliberate policies pursued by the colonial rulers and the activities of the Indians and Portuguese and Greek petty traders. In fact, in many of these areas, the old central elite virtually disappeared.\nIt is largely this wide variation in their qualifications and background that makes it so difficult to define precisely in those terms who were the new elite of colonial Africa. One can thus justifiably argue that the issue of the rise of a new elite among any African people in the colonial era was largely a question of what amount and kind of educational and economic opportunities were available to the people and how far they put those opportunities to effective use. All the studies so far carried out on this aspect of the matter suggest that regions or colonies which witnessed the most intensive efforts in the propagation of western education and which offered Africans more opportunities for meaningful participation in trade and commercial agriculture produced the largest number of people of elite status.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Emergence of the Western-educated elite', 'content': ""According to Leo Kuper, as many as 3448 African students passed through the Lovedale Missionary Institution alone between 1841 when it was opened and December 1896.

Even smaller was the elite in East and Central Africa by that date.

The ideas were not entirely new, and there were points of convergence between what the missionaries preached and what the Africans believed, such as the belief in God and obedience to His will as the final Judge and Creator of men.\nThe missionaries, however, had a negative attitude towards African religion and culture and were determined right from the start to stamp them out. The missionaries preached that the only God was the one whose nature and character had been revealed in the Bible, and that all other gods were mere illusions; that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, was the final revelation and the only Saviour of mankind, and that the Church was the sole dispenser of divine grace and that there was no salvation outside the Church.

Schools might have portions of ground given to them for purposes of illustration; and a profit, by the working of the children, might accrue to the school, and *be shared in by the children also.* Arts and manufactures might gradually be introduced; an interest, by practical illustration, might be thrown into the subject of study or employment; and as the child might largely share the gain, the parents would be benefited, and the child to the man instructed.

If the Government at Cape Coast should not, then, be able to relieve itself from the charge of fostering periodical collisions—or periodical menaces of collision—with Ashantee by its unpardonable remissness in the observance of common urbanity, common prudence, or common statecraft, the Home Government cannot be held less venial in the part which it has indirectly played in causing that sort of local spasm and turmoil which idle hands and tongues can always provoke.

It has been answered by the Home Government that undertakings which are commercial should be committed to the assiduity and skill of persons who are devoted to the pursuit of commerce; but I would fain suggest that there are seasons and places when and where the duty is incumbent on the parent state to aid and encourage the rational enterprise of individuals. The Government at Cape Coast has not introduced substantial measures of reform, because it has not had the funds which were sufficient for a purpose so needful.

The Primitive Methodist Society sent two of their ministers to this island on the 28th of July last. One is now on his way to England on account of the illness of his wife, and only one now remains on the station; perhaps he may be forced to quit as the other did. This we hope not. Is it not, then, absolutely necessary for every Christian mission to maintain an efficient school at all their respective stations out here? Mr. Editor, I really believe you will fully coincide with me. Here is a mission just established—one of the agents sent out forced to quit his post. Should a proper and efficient school be maintained, a proper assistant can be easily procured to supply the vacancy in any similar case. Through you, my dear Mr. Editor, I beg to impress on the Primitive Methodist Society in London that they have done well indeed in supplying this island with two of their excellent ministers (now only one, as the other has already quitted the station, owing to domestic affliction), and that they would do still better in maintaining a good and efficient school on the island. This would be a very life indeed to their African mission, and without this it will be quite impossible for them to succeed to any extent. Let a proper schoolmaster be selected from their academy; he must be an unmarried man, as it is quite the fact, as always reported that the climate of Africa does not agree with the European ladies. This is emphatically the truth, therefore it would be of no use sending married men to come and labour here; it would be merely an eventual waste of lives and money. Let this master be well paid for his services—the money so well spent will confer a great boon on the island and on the generation unborn. If the said Society could afford to pay the present negro teacher the sum of eighty pounds a-year, inefficient as he is, merely to teach reading and spelling, surely the Society would not deem it too expensive to have a competent master appointed and well paid, while the present teacher's wages will be quite sufficient to procure valuable assistants to the master of the school from the Wesleyan or Church of England Colleges at Sierra Leone. The present Africans, Mr. Editor, are fully determined to take their rank if possible among the civilised nations, but without proper training this would be quite impossible. Reading and spelling would not suffice as the requirements of Africans in the nineteenth century.

No one can feel a deeper interest than we do in the spread of education on the West Coast of Africa, and we have not given up our hopes of being ere long instrumental in aiding it. We should have been very sorry had the rumour above mentioned proved to be the voice of a fact. Lagos and the Gold Coast, included now in one colony, are not far distant one from the other, and it would seem to us a great waste of energy to establish and attempt to carry on two high schools so near the one to the other, when one might be made to meet all the necessities of the Fantee and Aku countries in this matter. We are happy, therefore, to be able to state that there is not any such intention on the part of the Wesleyan Missionary Society, who will concentrate all their energies in this direction on one such school at Lagos. We understand that liberal arrangements have been made by this energetic Society for establishing the Lagos School and making it an efficient one. Native catechists and school teachers are much wanted, and it is only through such schools that the want can be supplied. It is not creditable to the Government that they do so little toward providing for public education out of the ample revenues of the Gold Coast Colony. Education must now be the first great element of development and progress there. All that can be done without it has been done.

But missionary work cannot be carried on in West Africa without imparting secular knowledge to the people; and since the Government neglect their duty in this respect, the Missionary Societies have no alternative but to undertake it or abandon their work altogether. It cannot therefore be a matter for surprise that they take upon themselves the task of imparting that knowledge.

If, as stated in my previous correspondence, such a school as the High-class School be amply and efficiently supported, it will prove a great boon to the place. That the educational work that is thus being inaugurated here needs such support as you have pleaded for will be evident from the fact that it has not been undertaken by the Church Missionary Society, as your remarks would seem to indicate, but by the sole efforts of some of the native residents of this place, who, sensible of the great educational wants of the community, have requested the Bishop of Sierra Leone to aid them in the establishment here of the Church of England with a properly-organized school; and the kind-hearted prelate, ever ready to lend a helping hand to every very good work, promised to aid their efforts in the undertaking. From this it will be seen that such needful help as you have advocated is a *sine qua non* in the proper development of education in this place; and should it be afforded, an efficient staff of competent teachers will be secured, and high-class schools, grammar schools, collegiate schools, and other seminaries of learning will be established along this Coast, which will undoubtedly be productive of unspeakable benefit to the country at large.

This is a sign of progress the more remarkable when it is remembered that at a not very remote period the principal instruments of civilisation in Africa were reputed to be rum and gunpowder. But the schoolmaster, chiefly through the medium of the missionary societies, has long been abroad in Africa. Light on the subject is derived from The Lagos Weekly Record, which recently, in commenting on the possibilities of the Yoruba country, as indicated in the Governor\'s report, remarked that ""The time was at hand when the civilised Natives, now appearing to flourish in the settlement, will demand outlets for their energies, and new sources of livelihood; when in order to succeed, or even to live, they will be obliged to join the great army of aboriginal producers, or ally themselves to the foreign consumers, or be crushed between the two.""\n\nThe necessities thus summarised are recognised both by the Government and by the missionary societies, and the former is devising the establishment of an institution for training youths in various handicrafts. At present, it is stated, the whole of the coast is dependent for mechanics upon the protégés of the Basel Mission and repatriates from the Brazils. The extension of the work of technical education is encouraged by the success that has attended the efforts of the Basel missionaries, thanks to whom ""the Gold Coast is now the principal source whence good coopers, carpenters, blacksmiths, and wheelwrights can be obtained, and the skilled mechanics of Accra are in great demand all over the West Coast from Sierra Leone to the Congo."" The fact that there is scope in the Colony, as well as at other points along the West Coast, for almost any number of skilled mechanics, certainly favours the enterprise now under the consideration of the Government, and this scope for technical skill cannot fail to be greatly broadened as the interior is increasingly opened up. The practical steps which are being taken in the direction of equipping African youths in the most modern of civilised fashions for the struggle for existence on their own soil may be briefly summed up. The Bishop of Sierra Leone, assisted by Canon Taylor Smith, will, during their present visit to England, make an effort to raise £2,000 for the erection at Freetown of a technical school for the education of young Africans: whilst Captain Denton, during his residence in England on leave, will give attention to the details of the proposed Government scheme.'}, {'id': 6483, 'article_title': '""Technical Education"" in West Africa', 'full_section_title': '""Technical Education"" in West Africa', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1894#article-3', 'issue_date': '01_08_1894', 'content': 'While recognising the substantial advantages which must accrue to West African colonies by a judicious effort at technical education, it is not a little amusing to note the strain in which our contemporary apologises for West Africa being behind the times in the matter under discussion.

He would seek the protection of England, and look to a British Resident to advise him, and especially to see that English subjects in his country behave well, and that if his subjects behave ill, their offences are punished. Above all, he says, I would encourage education, believing that the enlightenment of children\'s minds is the only way to root out superstition and crime, and to train up men and women to do their duty to themselves and each other. It is by education and the spread of intelligence, that you can put an end to polygamy and domestic slavery, and tribal feud and the other effects of ignorance that prevail in Africa.

Written apropos of frequent fires in Abeokuta, and of the want of some non-inflammable material for the roofs of the air and light-excluding native hut, the writer shows how slowly the system hitherto pursued works for material improvement, and the need of efforts in an industrial direction: ""It is quite a question whether skilled labour should not in good policy take the lead, and reading and writing follow after, if not in point of time, yet in point of importance."" And again: ""Religion would be best promoted in the end by making industrial pursuits the first aim (not before religion, but before head knowledge) in point of importance. It is difficult, as experience proves in the few efforts already made, to communicate hand knowledge, but where the welfare of a country is considered, difficulties should be less thought of."" The African-Aid Society and the African Times have never spoken out more strongly than this. Truth will make its way, in spite of prejudice and jealousy. The ""native who returned from the Brazils,"" and who was sent out to Abeokuta under the auspices of the African-Aid Society, gives a faint foreshadowing of the material advancement in Africa that will some day result from the return of the African race in America to the lands of their forefathers. Had not some of the missionary body in Abeokuta opposed the sending of such people from America by the African-Aid Society, many brick and tile makers, and other valuable artisans, might now have been established there. We are glad to see that a change is coming over the spirit of our friends in that place. America will soon have many choice workmen and agriculturists from among its emancipated slaves, ready to bring their industrial knowledge to the assistance of the land of their forefathers. There are representatives there of every African race on the West, and of many races on the East Coast. Meanwhile we must all, Government and people, do the best we can, wherever British authority is in any way acknowledged, to introduce into the country those improvements in means of intercommunication, in dwellings, in tillage, and in mechanical arts, that civilization in Europe and America has acquired, and by which alone civilization can progress. We repeat our belief that coloured artisans from America are valuable, if not indispensable, for this work.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1863#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Industrial Education in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Every month's experience justifies more and more the views of the African-Aid Society upon this question—views which they have only not carried into practical operation because, hitherto, there have been no funds for the work. To raise the industrial status of the African people, they must be taught those things which the civilised world has bit by bit acquired. Leave them to themselves, and they will never learn them. Why should they? They have not the same physical necessities that more northern people have. And physical necessity has been one of the great spurs to northern advancement. From a barbarism almost as degraded as that of the African, we have, under its impulse, gradually progressed to our present industrial, scientific, and social elevation. But there is no reason why the Africans should be condemned to a similar tortoise-like advance. The knowledge we have laboriously and tediously gained, in part from earlier civilizations, we could easily and rapidly impart, but it seems to have been almost the last thing thought of. In our anxiety to Christianise we have too much lost sight of the material aid that a spread of the arts, conveniences, and industrial facilities of civilization can bring to the inculcation of moral and religious truth. The African-Aid Society was formed that it might apply and urge the application of what was evidently so much needed. When it expressed its desire to conduct an emigration of coloured people from Canada and the United States to Africa, it was that it might introduce in their persons engineers, machinists, carpenters, blacksmiths, masons, cabinetmakers, brick and tile makers, trained agriculturists, millwrights, wheelwrights, coopers, waggon builders, road makers, &c., &c., &c. The progress of conviction as to the necessity of this has been slow in England. And this is not surprising, because it had not possessed the missionary mind in Africa. Any imaginable sum might be asked for religious missionary purposes in Africa, and it would be obtained. But ask for a small sum to teach the Africans the comforts and decencies, conveniences and industrial appliances of civilised life, and no national sentiment responded to the appeal. This is manifestly wrong. What we have freely received we ought freely to give. We, as a people, two thousand years ago had aid to help us out of our barbarism. The Britons were not left to imagine the utility of roads, and the advantage of clearings through forests: the Romans made roads and clearings for them. They were not left to imagine the advantage and comfort of solidly-constructed and comparatively commodious edifices: the Romans built towns and villages among them. And their work was not intended for mere temporary use alone. Substantial traces of it remain to this day. They are continually challenging our gratitude and admiration. And shall we not imitate in some degree the beneficial example? Shall we not strive to confer solid material benefits upon that Africa we so long assisted to rob of its most valuable possession—its human life; that we so long assisted to plunge deeper and deeper into the thick mire of barbarism, instead of helping her out of it? Our responsibilities toward Africa are far heavier than the public conscience has yet acknowledged. We know all the difference that exists between Great Britain now in Africa, and Rome formerly in Britain. Rome was laying the foundation for a permanent domination. We are not. Nationally, therefore, there is no analogy. But Rome had no such hideous debt of blood to Britain as we have to Africa. And we are Christian, not Pagan. We profess to be governed by higher principles than the Romans knew. We must, therefore, both as Government and people, do more than we have hitherto done for Africa. We must send her other teachers, as well as religious ones. We must establish centres of mechanical and other industry. The missionary mind in Africa is opening to this great truth.

Efforts are made to improve, but not such as could be desired, from this cause. The system of building in large compounds is connected with the laws and superstitions of the country; a general change and improvement in house building will go hand in hand with changes in Government and religion. It would be very desirable, however, for Europeans to introduce better roofing materials. Now iron will not do unless it could be effectually lined by some non-conductor of heat and sound. A lining is again attended with this evil, that the space between becomes the resort of vermin. Some other material should be obtained; tiles would be better than iron, and good clay can be found everywhere; but there is no workman skilled in tile making to teach the natives, and no European has yet seriously attempted to introduce the art. A native, who returned from the Brazils, made a few and covered his own house in a rough way. He died without communicating his art to others. A great impediment exists in the fact, that it is apparently an easier and more genteel employment for lads to become clerks, or to do a little trade on their own account, than to engage in mechanical employments. The ease with which credit is obtained, which is again the result of large profits, produces a host of petty traders, who end in becoming hopelessly involved in debt, giving the white merchant reason to call the people dishonest. We have heard of industrial schools, but experience proves that it is far easier to teach reading and writing, and less expensive, than mechanical arts.

The results in aptitude for interior missionary work, in energy, perseverance, and common sense, would have been enormous. ... The other plan (abstract teaching, divorced from material business) has been abundantly tried, and what is the result? Not only does the constant hammering at the brain, of which this raw (negro) youth must now become a victim, produce an unbalanced development, but the precocious memory that will characterise him is a deceptive gauge of progress made, and, like much precociousness elsewhere, the results are disappointing in after life. For this reason, a successfully-passed examination on paper is not the test in Africa that it is in England. ... Can we be surprised that the very last thing he (the negro young man) thinks of is the development of his country or making his father\'s village better than he found it—and thus his want of accuracy, want of perseverance and skill, and all that goes to make a man master of any situation, remain uncorrected, and put him altogether out of the running. We are convinced that there is a more excellent way, and we regret it has not more generally approved itself to those who have done such good work in other respects in this part of Africa. Other bodies, and notably the Roman Catholics, seem to be far ahead of us in this respect. How far they fail in developing the minds and consciences of the Africans we will not here discuss; but their systems of technical training are thoroughly worthy of imitation.""\n\nThe Bishop goes on to explain that the work that has been accomplished is by no means to be deprecated—indeed, it is\n\ndifficult to imagine how low Sierra Leone must have fallen, mentally and morally, were it not for the mission work carried on in face of such grave difficulties, and upon a soil necessarily so unpromising, since the first occupation of the Colony 107 years ago.

No society or individual can do it; it is folly to suppose, or act upon the supposition, that commerce, societies, or individual efforts, can be successful in rapidly reclaiming or bringing Africa from its present savage condition to a state of civilisation. Possibly private efforts might, in the lapse of many hundred years, partially effect the civilisation of this vast, rich, and unknown country. Still, if after seventy years' occupancy of Sierra Leone by Great Britain, the inhabitants do not yet know the plough, or any agricultural labour-saving implement whatever, or practise those arts known and esteemed as essential to civil life, you may form some idea of the number of years which individual effort, aided by a British Colonial Government, may require to bring Africa up to the lowest plane and meanest type of civil man.\n\nProfoundly penetrated with these views—knowing from personal and extended observation that they are founded in truth—I cannot too forcibly urge upon you and all true friends of Africa, to concentrate all of influence we may possess in obtaining united national action upon this great subject.\n\nIf it was ever the duty of civil governments to seek to redeem from savage life barbaric nations, surely it is time that England and America should combine in immediately planting in Africa such permanent institutions as will most speedily and effectually work this change. This only can be done by negotiation and the introduction of the useful arts. By establishing agricultural schools—not a chief but would warmly second their efforts—all would gladly send their children; and by the immediate introduction of labour-saving machines, to some of which you lately alluded, the wonderful productiveness of the soil and climate would largely and speedily repay any advance of capital or outlay that may be made, and peace, and law, and kindness, and plenty will effectually take the place of strife, of crime, force, hatred, and want.

Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care.

The lecturer said: The future of South Africa was much bound up with this question of administration, and especially the educational part of it. A proper education meant an assimilation of the coloured man to the ideal of the white man, with regard to habits of mind and of thought. The question of education was visibly affected by political disturbances. With regard to the general question, which was viewed in many different ways by white people both in the colony and at home, he said the great desideratum of the hour in South Africa was to raise the discussion of important matters beyond the atmosphere of party. Nothing had so much injured the native as the custom of using him for the purpose of a party cry. Premising that he should confine himself principally to the state of affairs in the Cape Colony, the Lecturer said he should show that there had existed and did still exist in that colony a State scheme for the instruction of the natives in nearly everything they might require to know, whether it was to shoe a horse, make a wheel, or learn Greek. As he had himself endeavoured to instruct the Caffre in the Greek declensions, in his capacity as Government Lecturer in the colony, he might say that the loftiness and catholicity of the scheme had come home to him. Remarking upon the difficulties in the way of applying such a scheme in a sparsely-peopled savage country like South Africa, he said the number of white colonists at the Cape was about equal to the population of Leeds, and these had to legislate for the reclamation of more than a million blacks, who were scattered over an immense tract. Other difficulties lay in the unequal social developments among the black people, in the bi-lingual character of the white population, and in the want of unanimity on the part of the white colonists as to the proper lines upon which native education ought to go. To bring under one system of State education men of different religious views, hard though it might be, was an easy task for the political legislator compared with that encountered in an attempt to group under one plan men so intellectually and, if he might use the term, spiritually distinct as the European and the African aboriginal races. The difference between the races was, practically speaking, one absolutely of kind, not of degree. Undeterred by difficulties, legislators at the Cape had boldly grappled with the question, and they had established a complete educational ladder, with the kraal schools at the bottom and the university at the top. After going with some detail into the working of the scheme in that colony, and suggesting some possible improvements in the system, he remarked that though philanthropy in theory, in practice it was unphilosophic. A cardinal fact was ignored—the generic difference between the European and the Caffre. The principle of heredity was ignored. He was inclined to believe that the Caffre would be influenced by a simple and rather an autocratic system. Advocating a certain measure of compulsion in order to make the Caffre industrious, and to compel him to be taught, he said the educationist should walk hand in hand with the white magistrate and the missionary; these three classes of men really replace the autocracy of the chiefs. He thought that if the philanthropist could be persuaded to believe that all men were not equal, and if the Boer could be persuaded to believe that they might be equal in course of time—in fact, that there was a germ which might be worked upon in the native, there would be some chance of an agreement. If both philanthropist and Boer should take the scientific view that the Caffre was really nothing more than he was by descent, a savage pure and simple, but that he had in him the makings of a good citizen, there would be considerably less friction in South Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1884#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When writing last month on the all-important subject of the future spread of Christian civilization in West Africa, we pointed out that educated natives, more or less under the influence of Christian faith, more or less imbued with Christian principles, more or less governed by Christian precepts, are and will be indispensable as a vanguard of the great army of civilization that must be projected upon the ignorant barbarism of heathen Africa whenever the means for such projection shall be arranged. We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""and Lagos, shall become convinced by the introduction of the necessary machinery for such purpose, that it is the desire and determination of the supreme sovereign power, the British Government, to effect their civilization. It has now been sufficiently established that the Africans are receptive, that they are easily taught not only the rudiments of education, but when good masters are found for them, and they are placed under a good system, the higher branches also. We are not, therefore, asking the British Government to take a leap in the dark—to organize educational institutions without absolute knowledge as to whether the people are capable of receiving education. We could point to members of that once despised African race who occupy really an eminent position in law and medicine; and if we have not yet skilled engineers among them, it is only because there have not yet been inducements among them to the cultivation of those sciences whose mighty power is at this time revolutionizing the world. There is every possible encouragement, therefore, to the British Government in entering upon the noble work which we maintain that it is now their duty to undertake and set about in right good earnest. We would have two superior institutions established, one at Lagos and the other at Accra. These settlements and seats of Government are at so little distance from each other, and the facilities for passing from the one to the other are so frequent and so good, that one supreme organizing and superintending educational head would suffice for both. It is not a little feeble, glimmering light that we thirst to see introduced at those important points of West Africa, but one in educational power that shall resemble the electric among illuminating flames. Great Britain will thus, indeed, justify her presence and extend her beneficent influence on the West Coast of Africa. The work of African civilization is an immense work; the means employed, to be worth anything, must be commensurate with the end to be obtained. We need for those West African countries a host of African evangelists and apostles of civilization; we ask that ignorance shall be beaten down by an array of educational power capable of overcoming its inertia, conquering its will, and subduing to itself its sympathies and its love. Oh, 'tis a glorious work to be undertaken, a glorious aim to be accomplished—a work and an aim worthy of a Government that has taken seriously in hand the deliverance of South-eastern Europe from the paralyzing influences of a rule under which every noble aspiration has been strangled, and the commonest principles of humanity have been outraged and trampled under foot.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

The much-heralded black emigration schemes trumpeted by Garvey, whose ubiquitous publications reached deep into Africa, were only one example of a leitmotif which brought American blacks within the world view of African peoples. The themes of African redemption through American black missionaries were another.\nAfricans themselves, however, created the context of their next interaction with American blacks as they matriculated at American, largely Afro-American, schools and attended pan-African conferences and the like. Consequently, many Africans underwent a technical-educationalpolitical experience alien to their colonial world. When they re-entered their own worlds, many felt driven to resolve questions of ideology, cultural definition, educational values, political power, and pan-African unity or consciousness, guided by new perspectives.\nViewed against such an historical backdrop, the numerous pan-African conferences, Tuskegean educational and technical projects, the nØgritude movement and the occasional focus on American blacks in African millen› nial dreams, all illustrate the consistency of the pan-African theme among American and Caribbean blacks. They also show the variability of African responses to the New World overtures and ultimately the shaping by Africans themselves of these overtures to fit African specifications.\nIn sum, the populations of the African diaspora and the motive charac› terizing the many interactions between persons of the first and second black worlds included two visions. One was a vision of the union of religious forces among black populations in Africa and America or the reconstruction of Africa through importation of American and Antillean black technical expertise, initiated at the behest of American blacks. Another reflected the transformation of Africans from predicate to subject during the colonial period. The latter was a vision of the spiritual redemption, social recon› struction, and political reformation of African communities through the repatriation of African personnel and the energizing of African resources. Because of this vision, Africans had been educated in American schools, or sent to participate in technical and commercial activities; others were touched by American black writings or by anti-colonial ventures organized among blacks of the diaspora. This latter vision seemed not so much to discard as simply to vindicate and to reorientate to an African perspective the idealism implied in the earlier vision.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Ethiopianism', 'content': ""or hindrance of foreigners. Blyden concluded: During all the years which have elapsed since the commencement of modern progress, the African race has filled a very humble and subordinate part in the work of human civilization. But the march of events is developing the interesting fact that there is a career before this people which no other people can enter upon. There is a peculiar work for them to accomplish, both in the land of their bondage, and in the land of their fathers, which no other people can achieve. With the present prospects and privileges before his race - with the chances of arduous work, noble suffering, and magnificent achievement before them - I would rather be a member of this race than a Greek in the time of Alexander, a Roman in the Augustin period, or an AngloSaxon in the nineteenth century. 46 It was also Blyden who in his famous speech to the American Col› onization Society in May 1880 gave great publicity to the phrase 'Ethiopia Stretching Out her Hands Unto God' and equated Ethiopian with African; and it was he who first used the term 'African personality' in his lecture delivered on 19 May 1893 in Freetown when he described the African Race as 'a Great Race - great in its vitality, in its power of endurance and its prospect of perpetuity'. He continued: It is sad to think that there are some Africans, especially among those who have enjoyed the advantages of foreign training, who are so blind to the radical facts of humanity as to say, 'Let us do away with the sentiment of Race. Let us do away with our African personality and be if possible in another Race ...

Therefore, honour and love your Race ... If you are not yourself, if you surrender your personality, you have nothing left to give to the world .. . 47 Another great leader of the intellectual revolution of the time was undoubtedly that fiery Yoruba-Creole evangelist, James Johnson (c. 18361917).

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

Repatri› ation during the nineteenth century offered few material rewards for Europeans or non-Europeans. But by 1900, the divergence between Africa and the Americas had become too great. Persons of African descent became caught up in the self-consciousness of the age which produced the type of xenophobic nationalism that all but destroyed the appeal of Africa. More› over, the interest in Africa after the end of the slave trade grew from national lusts for power and wealth - and Afro-Americans lacked both political power and the wealth needed to stimulate their own interest, or influence those who were partitioning Africa into colonial spheres. The Afro-American view became focused more on the new developments within their hemisphere. Internal and inter-regional migrations and the quest to establish the good life against new deleterious challenges absorbed their attention. The African connection faded, but did not die. The return-toAfrica movement found individual promoters who could occasionally infuse the movement with new appeal.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'African nationalism and international developments', 'content': ""Kenyatta (Kenya); as well as J.

I do so because this may be the last opportunity I may have of publicly addressing you; and I wish honestly to state my opinions. I have lately heard of an opinion, almost a prophecy, very decidedly given, that Africa _must_ become a dominant nation; and this opinion was given by two individuals very different in station, much about the same time, and that time very recently. One was by a Cabinet Minister in England, at Aberdeen, the other in an essay delivered at the last distribution of prizes in the grammar school here by one of the instructors. Now, far be it from me either to deny the prophecy, or become a prophet myself; but I think that, in both instances, though the ""tale has been adorned,"" the moral has not been pointed. There is but one way in which Africa can be advanced, and that is, by the honesty, by the industry, and by the well-directed energy of the Africans themselves. If we trace the history of any nation emerging from barbarism to civilization, we shall find that though the first move was effected through foreign conquest or occupation, the remainder has been achieved by the people themselves. The first move has been effected as regards the Western Coast of Africa. European stations have been formed; European laws and customs have been introduced; European civilization has been witnessed; but are the Africans, as a race, emulating this example? Go outside any of the European settlements, and I fear you will still find slavery, torture, superstition, idolatry, and idleness. Until the Africans themselves shake off these vices, though we may succeed in establishing civilization in isolated parts, as in this colony, Africa as a country can never rise. It should, then, be the object of every patriotic African to stimulate his countrymen in the acquirement of those talents which have raised other countries, and not to encourage native indolence or presumption.\n\nIt is with feelings of deep regret we have to record the death of one of the most respected and influential of Sierra Leone native merchants, W. H. Pratt, Marshal of the Vice-Admiralty Court, &c., &c., who died at his residence, Palm Villas, on the night of Tuesday, the 21st February, 1865, aged sixty-two years. The late Mr. Pratt, who was very earnest in his endeavours for the advancement of Africa in industry, civilization, and Christianity, was an ardent supporter of the _African Times_, the beneficial influence of which in African affairs, and on opinions in and respecting Africa and the Africans, he warmly recognised. We beg to express our sympathy with his family and friends, by whom he seems to have been greatly beloved and appreciated.

America derived its culture from Western Europe; the people of Western Europe received theirs from the Romans; the Romans from the Greeks; the Greeks from the Phoenicians and Egyptians; and long before Tyrian merchants trafficked, or Egypt became the school of the world, a high civilization and a profound philosophy had a home beyond the Indus, in the old cradle of mankind. One race hands the torch of science to another; but no one seems to know how to strike the fire for itself. Had no invader gained a footing in England, this island would have remained in barbarism to this day; and America had been still the hunting-ground of the savage, had not civilization been imported. Africa is behind the rest; and yet not very far behind, for in the life of humanity three or four centuries are but as three or four years in the life of a man. She has not made time with her sister continents in the race of improvement, not because she is a sandy desert, for the fertility of her soil is exuberant, capable of enriching commerce with a profusion of valuable products which the world wants, but because she has been reserved for the habitation of black men, and the white men who attempt to explore and cultivate her perish. It was written that Africa should be redeemed by her own children; not those born on her soil, but those who shall have passed through the apprenticeship of servitude in strange lands, and learned the arts and religion of Christian nations in bondage.\n\n**CAN TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF.**—In a recent speech, ex-Governor Wright, of Indiana, said: ""As to the cant about the negro\'s ability to take care of himself, he had these facts to relate, and he would do so without comment: In 1862, the rebel Legislature of South Carolina raised a committee to inquire into the expediency of enslaving the 5,000 free negroes of Charleston. That committee reported against it, and stated that those 5,000 free negroes paid into the treasury of Charleston annually 27,000 dolls., and that their property amounted annually to 1,500,000 dolls. Out of that amount of property, 300,000 dolls. of it was composed of slaves. That the 9,000 free negroes of New Orleans in 1860 were worth as much *per capita* as the white people of Louisiana; that these free negroes had their own schools, their own benevolent societies, &c. These facts, he contended, proved that the free negro was capable of taking care of himself. He also stated that a lady who owned 500 negroes in 1860 told him that she had lost them all but 200 by the beginning of 1863. That year she made a contract with them to cultivate her farm on the shares, and that last year, under such a system, where the negro was working for himself as well as for his mistress, the 200 made her more money than 500 had done in slavery.""\n\n---\n\n**NOTICE OF PARTNERSHIP.**'}]","[{'document_title': 'Industrial Education in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '*at foot,* from the missionary paper of Abeokuta, is a tardy, but a powerful justification of the views of the African-Aid Society. Written apropos of frequent fires in Abeokuta, and of the want of some non-inflammable material for the roofs of the air and light-excluding native hut, the writer shows how slowly the system hitherto pursued works for material improvement, and the need of efforts in an industrial direction: ""It is quite a question whether skilled labour should not in good policy take the lead, and reading and writing follow after, if not in point of time, yet in point of importance."" And again: ""Religion would be best promoted in the end by making industrial pursuits the first aim (not before religion, but before head knowledge) in point of importance. It is difficult, as experience proves in the few efforts already made, to communicate hand knowledge, but where the welfare of a country is considered, difficulties should be less thought of."" The African-Aid Society and the African Times have never spoken out more strongly than this. Truth will make its way, in spite of prejudice and jealousy. The ""native who returned from the Brazils,"" and who was sent out to Abeokuta under the auspices of the African-Aid Society, gives a faint foreshadowing of the material advancement in Africa that will some day result from the return of the African race in America to the lands of their forefathers. Had not some of the missionary body in Abeokuta opposed the sending of such people from America by the African-Aid Society, many brick and tile makers, and other valuable artisans, might now have been established there. We are glad to see that a change is coming over the spirit of our friends in that place. America will soon have many choice workmen and agriculturists from among its emancipated slaves, ready to bring their industrial knowledge to the assistance of the land of their forefathers. There are representatives there of every African race on the West, and of many races on the East Coast. Meanwhile we must all, Government and people, do the best we can, wherever British authority is in any way acknowledged, to introduce into the country those improvements in means of intercommunication, in dwellings, in tillage, and in mechanical arts, that civilization in Europe and America has acquired, and by which alone civilization can progress.

To distant people, we form one of the most intelligent and civilized portions of Africa, who, although not under a European Government, are enjoying as much of their influence as if we were born civilized. But to have a proper knowledge of the cotton tree, it is necessary to approach it more closely, when it will be discovered that it is full of thorns. This is the only way I can contrast what our country is with what it is considered to be. Our country is, undoubtedly, a great port for the palm-oil trade; and it appears to me that the only influence existing is that of raking and draining it of every speck of oil that could be got—and nothing more. Sordid avarice and insatiable gain is their only and chief aim. We own that we are poor, ignorant, heathen people, and, perhaps, vile savages too, as we are often styled; but we cannot feel more happy than when we have Europeans among us, whose goodness we feel proud to copy and imitate. I do not think that the days of contraband, when man formed the chief article of trade among us, were worse than ours—the period when lawful commerce takes the lead, and the Christian religion regulates its progress. Trade, from the way it is carried on, has a rather debasing effect on us; religion, from the stingy manner it is introduced and its principles engrafted, tends to steep us in a twofold ignorance, almost as dark as that in which it found us; so that the only improvement resulting from the advantage both of commerce and religion among us, at present, is a low cunning and a doggish reverence. People whose ears are accustomed to hear the fair carol of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in our country through European influence and missionary efforts, might be constrained to denounce my observations as a slander: but if they know the truly meaning of multum in parvo, and how it is unscrupulously practised by their agents abroad, I need not labour to convince them. I do not ignore the fact that faithful workers have from time to time been sent to our country, and that, through them, we should have been better; but the thing is this, those already in the field informed them, ""When you go to Rome, do what Rome does."" The merchant, whose only ambition is to hoard up all he could rake from the negro\'s hide, grins with pleasure and satisfaction at his wretchedness, contrives new methods of aggravating humanity, and uses all his subtle skill in advocating, if possible, the total extinction of the vague, glimmering twilight that shines around us; and the missionary, as a rule, teaches the black man hardly anything beyond the Bible, transcribed in his own tongue. In one of their conferences, held at Gaboon, the missionaries have decided not to give us and our children any intellectual training. We keenly feel the result of such selfishness, not only for ourselves, but for our children and children\'s children. How painful it is to think that there is not a single youth in our country who is capable of being more than a menial servant in any of the European establishments here! Why is it so different at Bonny, at New Calabar, at Brass, and throughout the Niger territory? It is thirty-six years ago now since a mission was planted in our midst; yet we do not present a brighter aspect than that of a dilapidated and neglected plantation. There is nothing of civilizing industry introduced into the country whereby to profit our youths; whereas in the Niger Mission—which is working exclusively by native agency, headed by its Bishop, and a grand train of clerical and lay assistants—industrial training is incorporated with the work. To every mission-station in the Niger is appended a first-class boarding-school, the pupils of which are fit to teach the teachers whom the Mission here laboured so arduously to produce. The Niger is able to furnish herself with a good staff of able and competent artisans, interpreters, clerks, and teachers; and is getting up a theological institution to train their own men.

Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care.

Liberia has been a black republic for forty years; Sierra Leone has been a negro colony for a century; and it cannot be denied that each of these communities has made very gratifying progress. Yet, upon Dr. Blyden's own showing, that progress has been but partial, he still has to complain of his countrymen's imitativeness and lack of backbone. The responsibility for this, undoubtedly, rests to some extent upon the unsuitable character of the education which the civilized negroes have received; but it is more to the purpose to remember that three generations is a very brief period in the development of a pagan people. How slow the work of civilization in Liberia has been may be seen from the fact that, whereas there are some twenty thousand Christian negroes in the republic, there are more than a million who are pagans. And now we inevitably come to the primary question of all: whether or not the presumed racial inferiority of the negro is proved. Dr. Blyden pleads eloquently for his fellows, and triumphantly asks: How could an inferior race have produced Toussaint L'Ouverture? The question is not unnatural, but it is far from logical. The matter, as it fashions itself to us, is, and is likely to remain for a long time to come, an open one. The negro has, as yet, enjoyed no sufficient opportunity of proving either his mental equality with or his inferiority to the white. The experience of Sierra Leone and Liberia, so far as it has gone, has been in his favour; what we know of his moral history in that other black republic, Hayti, and in the United States, is at the best negative. As time goes on, the question, which is far more momentous than would appear to the unthinking, will settle itself. Emigration from America to Liberia, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, is proceeding satisfactorily; and Dr. Blyden states that 200,000 negroes in the United States are prepared to return to the land of their fathers. But colonization by private effort is, at the best, exceedingly slow; and in this instance it is perhaps well that it is so, since the gradual settlement of Liberia is far more likely to provide material for a strong and healthy State than a hasty rush would be. Social reformers for many a year to come will watch the experiment, as they have watched it in the past, with keen interest. The chief danger lies, as Dr. Blyden constantly points out, in the tendency to Europeanize the negro—to supersede customs and practices which are useful and often necessary in Africa by customs utterly out of place there. The ill-directed zeal of some of the less reflective missionaries has, no doubt, been to blame for some of this; but there is, we fancy, very little to complain of upon this head now. Let it be once proved beyond all doubt that negroes can found flourishing colonies, can develop the limitless resources of the continent which has been the cradle of their race; and, above all, that they can govern themselves prudently and self-reliantly,—and there will open up before the black man the assurance of a future as splendid and far-reaching as any that ever presented itself to a white conqueror."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1887#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Letter from North Carolina, United States', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. FitzGerald, many a midnight have you paced your room with tears in your eyes, weeping for Africa.

When, oh, when will the thick darkness disappear? You heard the still, small voice saying, ""Fear not; I will overcome the world."" Go forward; you have been refreshed, and start anew again. Africa to-day is not the Africa of forty years ago. The Africa of forty years ago was the Africa degraded men turned up their noses against. But when speaking of the Africa of to-day, the civilized and Christian world speak of it as the land of gold and diamonds, of mineral and vegetable resources. Thanks to the great army who have brought my country out thus far, Africa is becoming so important in the eyes of the Christian world that the cobweb of prejudice is being removed. To be knighted, to be decked with laurels, to be honoured, to receive military honours, to receive medals of rare manufacture and taste, to dine at the banquets of England\'s greatest men, to sit in company with counts and countesses, lords and ladies, dukes and duchesses—yea, to dine with Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain and the Royal Family, and with the Kings of Europe, you must become an African explorer. Everything now-a-days seems to fall short and become insignificant to the explorers of Africa.\n\nMay the time speedily come when railroads and telegraphs will be all through Africa, when West Africa will shake hands with East, North with South! African navies shall then float on the African seas, with the African pennants flying on their topmasts. Then men shall learn to respect her.\n\n""I see, or think I see, a glimmering from afar, A beam of light that shines for Africa, To save her from despair.""\n\nCheer up, Mr. FitzGerald; cheer up; your work is not in vain. Are the works for Africa by the philanthropists and missionaries of England and America in vain? Oh, no; who dare be so blind as not to see the fruits of missionary labours in Sierra Leone and along the whole coast of Africa?\n\nThe clock has struck two A.M. My heart and eyes are full. I am pacing up and down my room alone, absorbed in thoughts about my country; all is quiet and still. I must retire, Mr. FitzGerald, and say in conclusion, Africa, Africa, Africa for ever!

A general view would embrace every particular view, and the friend of Africa in general, would be found the friend of Africa in particular.\n\nI have been much struck with the similarity of feature presented by Africa in general. Without the intervention of the white man, ignorance, superstition, and idolatry, have prevailed, together with a nomadic mode of life one step only removed from that of the brute beasts around. With ignorance there have been found selfishness and cruelty, and regard for human life has been scarcely perceptible anywhere. With the white man's knowledge came also the white man's sins; and as with individuals men will be found to imitate the bad example rather than the good, so has it been with Africa in general, since only in the parts as yet unvisited by the white man is the black man found in his native simplicity and ignorance; whilst in all other parts he has acquired cunning, deceit, and mistrust.\n\nThe means originally adopted for the improvement (if improvement it could be called) of newly-discovered Africa had presently and ultimately in view gain. The possessions of the black man were coveted and craftily obtained; the black man's body even was made the subject of barter and exchange, with the object of his working for the white man's use, as cattle bought in market overt. No wonder, then, that the influence of the white man over the black was evil instead of good; and the improvement of Africa had subsequently to be effected through the removal of that mistrust and deceit which the white man's conduct had produced. Trade can be legitimate as well as beneficial. Had this been practically shown in Africa, who can calculate the enormous benefit which the white man's influence in Africa would, ere this, have brought. Some men's sins go before to judgment, and some they follow after. Transgressors go not without the punishment due to their offence, but those who follow them have the effect of their transgressions to overcome, ere they can be placed in the position they occupied before such offence was committed. Other means were doubtlessly adopted, and ultimately Christianity was brought to bear only where all these means had failed. No wonder, then, that religion was, to the black man, invested with the garment of a trade, and this investment proved against the white man, in return, the greatest hindrance to progress and improvement."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1864#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICA AND HER EVANGELIZATION', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'that nation in poverty, nakedness, and rags.

England, France, Portugal, Germany, and Italy are attempting to obtain titles to the country. England has made annexation of the coast lying adjacent to her colony of Sierra Leone; France is forcing her way on the Senegal and toward the head-waters of the Niger; she threatens to annex the coast from the Gaboon to the Congo, some 250 miles, and is running her lines on the Upper Congo. Her Chamber of Deputies has granted the De Brazza mission, by a vote of 449 to 3, a credit of a million and a quarter of francs. The Portuguese Government has appointed explorers and examined the Congo country, and assumes to exercise control over all the territory at the mouth of the Congo. The German Reichstag has increased its annual appropriation for the exploration of Africa. Italy has despatched a party to Abyssinia for geographical and mercantile purposes. She has also concluded treaties which promise to make Assab a centre of commerce. The Sultan of Morocco has authorized Spain to take possession of Santa Cruz del Mar, and the Sultan of Zanzibar has purchased six superior steamers to constitute a regular coast service, in the interest of commerce and for the suppression of the slave-trade. The International African Association, which owes its origin to the philanthropic initiative of Leopold II., King of the Belgians, has received large subscriptions and pushed forward exploring expeditions to start and equip the line of hospitable and scientific stations which are to bound the East and West Coast, and form a civilizing girdle around Central Africa. And the results following the explorations of Livingstone and Stanley and De Brazza are attracting the attention of the civilized world. What was a \'Dark Continent,\' by the indomitable energy of these explorers, seems likely to prove the richest quarter of the globe. Not only does the land produce, with slight persuasion of tillage, admirable crops of cotton and coffee, but the soil is rich in diamonds on its southern coast, and in iron on its northern. Captain Burton has asserted that he knows nothing to equal the prodigious wealth of the land, even in California, or in the Brazils. \'Gold dust is panned by native women from the sands of the sea shore.

The spectacle of the earnestness, poverty, and simplicity of the Moslem missionaries has a powerful effect on the minds of the negroes, while the greed and the evil lives of Europeans go far to neutralize any good results that may accrue from the teaching of Christianity. Dr. Blyden says that the European languages ""have come to the greater portion of the natives associated with profligacy, plunder, and cruelty, and devoid of any connexion with spiritual things; while the Arabic is regarded by them as the language of prayer and devotion, of religion and piety, of all that is unworldly and spiritual."" And Mr. Thomson\'s evidence is to much the same effect.\n\nSouth of the Equator the Arabs are Mohammedans only in name, and there the slave trade is a fatal obstacle to all improvement. Indeed, it would seem that Islam fails to exert that power over any of the races of the great Bantu family which it exercises over the true negroes of the Soudan. Here, among the higher Bantu tribes south of the Congo, seems to be the region where Christian effort seems most likely to be crowned with success. The efforts of Moffat and Livingstone among the Bechuanas show how readily they embrace and retain the teaching of Christianity. With the true negroes of Nigritia, whose cerebral development is far lower, the creed of Islam would, for the present, appear to be the highest form of faith which they can attain and retain.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1887#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'What the Royal Niger Company is Doing for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It should be borne in mind by those who look for quick and fabulous returns from their investments that Africa occupies a singular position.

The fact is that generations must pass before the country can be properly developed. We are not dealing with a country in which there are accumulated wealth, acquired habits of industry, and a knowledge of art, but with peoples who are absolutely ignorant. There is potential wealth in the land, but it must be cultivated. At present no trade is done except in forest products.

Indigo will be one of these, and Africa will become one of the great indigo-producing countries of the world.
