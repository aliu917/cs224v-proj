The textbook discusses similar practices in other African states, such as the sacred kingship, tribute systems, and centralized power structures seen in the Shona and Lunda states, where kings controlled land allocation and received tribute to reinforce their authority. It also mentions the use of military power and tribute in the empires of Mirambo and Nyungu ya Mawe. However, it does not provide direct evidence regarding the Dahomian king's specific practices. In contrast, The African Times articles offer detailed accounts of the Dahomian king's elaborate ceremonies, such as victory commemorations and monument constructions, which involved significant displays of wealth, including gold, silver, silk, and human sacrifices. These ceremonies reinforced the king's legitimacy by honoring ancestors and commemorating victories, thereby establishing a centralized political structure. The articles also highlight the king's use of tributary obligations, such as collecting tribute from the Ayors and enforcing customs that required regional chiefs and foreigners to attend these ceremonies, demonstrating regional dominance. However, they also reveal the brutal and violent aspects of these customs, such as human sacrifices, which complicate the claim's implication of a purely political and economic strategy. Overall, while the textbook lacks specific details on Dahomey, The African Times provides a nuanced view that supports the claim while acknowledging the complex and often violent nature of Dahomian power displays.","The provided paragraphs from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook do not explicitly discuss the Dahomian king's use of public ceremonies and customs to assert authority, reinforce legitimacy, or display power and wealth.

This veritable revolution was sometimes achieved without an obvious change of political system; sometimes, as in the case of Borno, it necessitated a change of dynasty.$^{8}$ Often there was a compromise as 'new men' were appointed to old chieftaincies and made to function in new bureaucratic ways, or new offices came to acquire something of the ethos of older traditional titles."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'On the eve of the nineteenth century', 'content': ""Allowing for differences in detail, the Shona and Lunda states were structured around similar organizational principles.

The interrelationship between kingship and fertility underpinned the mys› tification of the ruler and reinforced his position as symbolic owner and spiritual guardian of the land. As a result, he retained the exclusive right to allocate land, which was the basis of control over subordinate chiefs and other subjects and underpinned a cycle of reciprocity. In repayment for the opportunity to use the king's land and benefit from his divine prowess, his subjects were expected to provide specified taxes, labour service and tribute that varied from one kingdom to another. Throughout both state systems, moreover, the largest tusk of a dead elephant automatically belonged to the monarch as owner of the land. In some societies, such as Manica, the Lunda of Kazembe, and Undi, the monarch also maintained a theoretical monopoly over commerce, while in Changamire's kingdom the ruler was the ultimate owner of most cattle.$^{5}$ These tribute, labour and commercial arrangements enhanced the power and wealth of the monarch, who redistributed to his principal lieutenants a portion of the surplus which he extracted, to ensure their continued loyalty.

These changes occurred without civil strife, in part because there had always been considerable autonomy in outlying districts, the growing prosperity of which made office at the capital less important.\nSo far only the upper levels of the administrative system have been discussed. Administration at the 'grass roots' was more uniform (and similar to that found elsewhere in West Africa). The smallest units, households or camps, were grouped into larger units, defined by a territory or by kinship. Generally pastoralists, Tuareg or Fulbe, were more organized through links of kinship than were agriculturalists, and in consequence retained their own ardo'en or tambura as leaders. Their cohesion gave them a political strength that the more fragmented agriculturalists did not have, but this superior strength relative to the rest of the population did not last into the second half of the century.\nIn larger, long-settled towns and villages ward representatives could be co-ordinated by one of their number, known as the mai gari, magaji, dagaci or mukoshi.

As a necessary part of tax collection, the administration gathered political information, ratified appointments; collected shares of inheritance, took charge of and dispatched the property of strangers who died en route; organized the arrest of a criminal or a runaway slave, forwarded defendants in civil cases, arranged the release of someone wrongfully detained or someone to be ransomed; took intractable cases for mediation by the office› holder or themselves answered charges of oppression by complainants at the amir's personal court; and in time of war organized the recruitment of people for campaigns.

Nyungu ya Mawe, like Mirambo, used the ruga-ruga to establish himself among the Kimbu. Between 1870 and 1880 he campaigned from his base in Kiwele and gained control of the trade route to the coast east of Tabora and the southbound route from Tabora to Ufipa and Lake Tanganyika.

Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements.

It assigned a common function to the administrator and the African chief who in assessing and collecting the tax, often in conjunction with local councils of elders or notables, reminded everyone of the regulatory power of the new system.$^{27}$ Furthermore after tax collectors as such, there soon appeared administrative agents who became part of the new colonial elite.

Decentralized residence implies a category of intermediaries at the capital, who at the outset might be seen as 'clients' of the amir. But they, given the lineage idiom of the political system, developed lineages of their own; in consequence, the amir created a further category of clients from those unable to develop lineages, namely palace slaves, but they played a minor role. Centralized residence, in contrast, implied no such category of intermediaries between office-holder and amir, but in time the amir developed a palace slave retinue to act as his personal agents, and they played an important role in government. Centralized residence also implied that the office-holder could have charge of a number of widely dispersed towns, villages or peoples (thus preventing any territorial blocs of power), whereas decentralized residence usually meant that the office-holder's headquarters were within an area that owed allegiance to him as a whole, with only a few, if any, villages likely to owe extra-territorial allegiance to another office.\nResidence as a criterion cannot be applied too strictly.

The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': 'Literary culture in the Western Sudan', 'content': 'It would appear that basically contending interests penetrated the Western Sudan zone of West Africa during the colonial period, the colonial or European and the Muslim represented by the Dyula.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 0, 'article_title': 'More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey', 'full_section_title': 'More Massacres—Latest Intelligence from Dahomey', 'last_edit_date': '11-30-1861', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_02_1862#article-0', 'issue_date': '22_02_1862', 'content': ""In about a week after this he started for Kanna, one of his chief towns, about eight miles east of Abomey, where he has a large palace.

The next object that attracted my attention was the palm of a dead man's hand suspended upon a gate, in token of victory gained over Egbas during the late hostility between the Porto Novans and that nation. On proceeding through the market, I saw skulls of human beings, over ten in number, exhibited on poles as an example to thieves and murderers. Hard by the King's palace are innumerable skulls of human beings placed upon an elevation of wood erected for that purpose, and adorned with palm-leaves. Besides these there are fetishes of all kinds to be seen in every corner of the streets, in every gate and in every house; and though the country is so excessively populated, yet nothing like civility or godliness is to be noticed in the manners of the people. Ignorance, barbarity, and filth are to be seen here in their true colour.\n\n**Godome,** where we landed, is equal to Porto Novo in point of degradation; for in the former we can boast of a chapel, but there is not a single place of worship of any kind to be found here. There are fetishes and images of all kinds and forms to be seen in every corner of the streets, to which the inhabitants pay due homage. I was conducted into the palace of the King, who, I was sorry to find, was absent, as he was on his way to Dahomey on a summons from the King, to witness the celebration of the yearly custom, as well as all other chiefs. Foreigners, &c., are also summoned to witness this dreadful ceremony, in which the lives of many are to be destroyed. The King is a terror to his people; all are therefore bound to obey his call. The very scene at the King's gate in Godome is frightful. Just opposite are three terrible images of moulded earth, sitting down, in the form of men, and having their arms folded. In the first apartment I noticed three men sitting down, chained by their necks and waists, and with a heap of palm kernels placed before them, which I saw them breaking and chewing. These are called the King's prisoners. I had to pass them as quickly as possible, for fear of involving myself in the King's quarrel. On going through the King's palace I met all his courtiers reclining in the verandah: each shook my hand, gave me a seat, and then inquired the cause of my visit. My guide told them we were missionaries going to establish the Gospel in Little Popo, and asked them in the meantime to grant us permission to pass to\n**[FEB. 1, 1876.]**""}, {'id': 3061, 'article_title': 'THE GOLD COAST.', 'full_section_title': 'THE GOLD COAST.', 'last_edit_date': '02-01-1876', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1876#article-22', 'issue_date': '01_02_1876', 'content': '\n\n**Whydah.** They promised to grant us this as soon as we were ready to depart. On the night of the 27th inst. Prince Gbo, who succeeded the King during his absence, called upon me where I put up. We sat in long conversation, and I seized an opportunity to direct it to the subject of religion, and asked him whether he would not like to have the Gospel preached in his country. Poor man! he could not understand what I meant by the terms ""preaching the Gospel,"" but after a little explanation he seemed to like it, but confessed that nothing of the kind could be allowed to be introduced into his country without the sanction of the King of Dahomey. On Monday morning, the 28th inst., having procured carriers, we left for the next station, about eight to twelve miles from Godome, where we hoped to procure a canoe for Whydah. Along the way from Godome to the wharf is occupied by an extensive course of water about three or four feet deep, and no stranger can get through without going by hammock. Accordingly I procured one, to be carried by four men. Leaving Godome at seven, we went through, and whilst two men bore the hammock upon their shoulders, the other two had to raise me up by the shoulders and waist, so as to prevent my being dragged along through the water: this occupies a course of about five to six miles\' distance. As there are many custom-houses by the way, to whose officers we were bound to pay tribute, my guide told me that we should endeavour to secure Prince Gbo\'s staff, as he is the senior officer of the customs, excepting those in the Whydah station; by this means we should pass along unmolested. I accordingly availed myself of the opportunity of securing this. It is three feet long, the head is carved exactly like a man\'s right hand held or stretched out. If a man hold out his right hand with his fingers stretched out he sees the staff to which I am alluding. I got to the next station early, about 9.30, for my carriers moved as fast as they could, and then waited for the rest of the carriers, who got to the station about eleven o\'clock. My guide then delivered the staff to the officer of this station—a wild and hungry-looking fellow of about fifty years of age. This man became angry on seeing this staff, because it prevented him from perpetrating his intentions. Notwithstanding this, he insisted upon the opening of my boxes. My guide, who is one of them, and knows their uncivil behaviour, told me to open them. I refused, alluding to the staff for my security. He then went and ransacked my guide\'s boxes and other luggage, deprived him of all his provisions, &c., seized and took away five of my mats which were to have covered me in the canoe, and told my guide to tell me I must pay something. I was obliged to make him a present of some money, besides the things he had seized, ere I was permitted to proceed. Having secured a canoe and men, we left this station for Whydah at 12.30. This is one of the principal stations of the King of Dahomey, in which a Wesleyan Society had flourished for some time. We had a pleasant voyage all along; but at length our canoe unfortunately ran upon a stump and narrowly escaped being capsized. On the morning of the 29th inst. I engaged a man to take me upon his shoulders, and had to walk about two hours in water three or four feet deep along the way to Whydah. As this is a chief station, we of necessity called here and obtained permission, else we would not be permitted to proceed. After visiting several persons in the place, and viewing other parts of the country, in which I noticed its populated state, the prosperity of trade, the beauty of the country itself, as well as its fine buildings, I thought what a sad thing indeed it is that a country possessed of such resources has not a single church or chapel to adorn or complete its beauty! As my guide told me we should get to my station the next day, or the third day at the longest time, and being resolved to proceed to Aguay that evening, I asked him to proceed with me to the palace of Prince Dinadu, and obtained permission to go away and get to my station in time. Accordingly we proceeded. But a minute or two before we left, Mr. Buko, our landlord, mentioned that he heard it noised abroad that the English Government were sending men as spies to Whydah. I told him I had heard nothing of the kind. Before this time it appears a similar report had gone forth informing the Prince that there are spies in the land; and, as we were bound to see him before we left, he was prepared also to meet us. Our landlord accompanied us to the palace of the Prince, who seemed to be exceedingly angry at our presence, and manifested a feeling totally unfriendly at the onset. Mr. Buko, our spokesman, knelt down, clapped his hands together several times, told him our mission, and besought him to grant us permission to pass to Little Popo, where we expect to begin our work. He inquired of me, through the interpreter, ""Why did not the Wesleyan Missionary Society build the chapel there before sending men to take possession of it?"" I said to my guide that there had been a chapel not only there, but even in Whydah, as well as Augway, &c., but these had been broken up. But for the good of the people and the instruction of the children this Mission wishes to renew these societies, and for this cause they sent me. On hearing this he was exasperated, and ordered us to return immediately by the way we came, and inform him by whom we were sent, that we have no permission or authority to proceed thither. All along from Dahomey beyond Popo is under the King\'s jurisdiction. Our Superintendent must write a letter of inquiry to the King of Dahomey and the princes or chiefs about his kingdom, so that due consideration might be given to the subject. As I had suffered a little from ill health shortly before I undertook my journey this way, I pleaded to obtain permission to have my course through Popo, not far from Whydah, so that I might return by the mail packet to Lagos, as the way through which I came to Whydah is rather tedious. Here he said he would not hear from me a word more, but I should return immediately by the way I came. He then called out, and a wild-looking gentleman presented himself, knelt down before him, and clapped his hands together several times. Upon his person we observed scores of keys suspended about his neck and waist. This he did to frighten me away. This individual I conjecture to be the keeper of the doors of the prison. On seeing this I became thoroughly convinced and satisfied that evil was determined upon, and that danger was at hand if I persisted. I beckoned to my guide and landlord, the latter kneeling and clapping his hands several times: we then bowed and retired from the palace. On returning to our landlord\'s house, we found him much troubled about this matter. We had thought at first to pass the night in Whydah, as the day was far gone; but having now found that we were becoming obstacles in the way of our landlord, we thought it most prudent to retire. There are scores of towns and villages situated on either side of the river which I saw on my way to Whydah. Also from Lagos up to Porto Novo we find scores of towns and villages on either side of the river. — *Wesleyan Magazine.*\n'}]","[{'document_title': 'A Royal Monument in Dahomey', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Whydah, Dahomey, June 30, 1868.\n\nSir,—I went up to Abomey in January last, to witness the erection of a monument which the king was going to make for his father. It was thus: He built three round houses in one of the palace-yards, named Commasie. They were each ten feet in diameter; one was for his deceased father, one for the supposed deceased friend of his father, and one for the late king's mother, who died before him. The following tools and materials were given by the king for making the monument: 2 gold pickaxes, 2 silver ditto; 2 gold hoes, and 2 silver ditto; 2 gold trowels, and 2 silver ditto; 2 copper hoes, 2 brass ditto, and 2 iron ditto; 2 iron pickaxes, 2 copper ditto, and 2 brass ditto; 1 gold-gilt watering-pot, and 1 silver-gilt ditto; 24 puncheons of rum; some gold and silver coins; some coral and other kinds of beads; some pieces of silk damask (these were torn into small pieces); and the blood of forty human beings caught by the king in his wars. All these implements were equally divided between the two prime ministers, Mingah and Maywoo, for mixing the swish, and during the mixing he threw into the mixture two boxes of gold-dust, the coral and other beads, the silk pieces also, and the blood of the human beings. This work occupied about a week. The coverings were silk, bamboo mats, and grass; and three ornaments—one like a vessel, one like an eagle, and one like a large umbrella tree—were put on the top of the three circular houses which we call monuments. At the front eight posts and cross-sticks were erected, and skulls and coral and other beads were hung on them. Smaller posts, similarly ornamented, were at the sides. On the day of the dedication almost everyone in the kingdom made presents to the king—gold coins, cowries, cloths, bullocks, sheep, goats, ducks, fowls, pigeons, palm-oil, &c. This also occupied about a week, and at the close of the presents the king produced six ornaments, some made in Europe and the others in Dahomey, in the form of hand lanterns, which were then shown to the assembly, the king saying that he had made them for his good father, who left him a large property to enjoy his kingship with. Three weeks after this he went on a war expedition, to some place of which we, the residents, are ignorant. He returned home unsuccessful, and of course, not being content at having come back empty-handed, made another expedition to five small places, which he broke, and caught all the people and brought them to Abomey. Now, lately, on the 20th inst., he made the gun custom, which ended yesterday. On this occasion all the captains swore in the large market that they would go to Abeokuta in four months' time and fight against the people there, and break the place, and catch every soul, and show them that the king has braver warriors yet than those whom the Abeokutans defeated in the last war.

The train comprised several grey-headed men and women. Some of them scarcely could walk. The sick among them were bound in cloth to poles, and carried. Their crime was that they did not come to the custom for his father, and they laughed at those who came from some towns behind them to present things to the King for the custom.

It seems to be now past dispute that, instead of disowning the acts of the brutal authorities at Whydah, who showed themselves to be fit servants to such a master, he has put a bold front on the matter, and sent the insolent message that ""he will pay the Commodore in powder and bullets if he will come up to Abomey."" This is the language that might be expected only from a doomed idiot, vapouring among the spiritless slaves by whom he may be surrounded, and who have worshipped him as almost a god, until he believes himself to be quite one. It is clearly full time that both King and people should be undeceived by coming in rude contact with something more than a few European trading clerks and agents, who, naturally enough, in the interests of their trade, submit, uncomplainingly, to everything short of actual plunder and brutal violence. Our opinions and feelings respecting the frantic iniquity of Dahomey are so strong, and our conviction that it is the imperative duty of Great Britain, as the real protecting Power on the West Coast of Africa, to put a final end to its enormities as being a daily insult to humanity, is so unalterable, that all we can say in reply to the braggart King is that we hope he will continue in his present frame of mind, and not be moved to feigned repentance by the blockade of his sea-ports. We do not wish him to repent, and thus save himself and his authority from destruction—unless his repentance should go so far (which it never would do) as to secure his faithful acquiescence in British demands, that he should never henceforth make any inroads into Egba territories in search of victims for his atrocious festivals, and that those festivals of blood should be entirely put an end to. The earth has groaned long enough under this blood-thirsty monster, and the devilish system that he at this time represents. That system is incurable by any other means than the entire destruction of the Power with which it is identified, and of which it is an inseparable part. The late King, and the present also, more than once declared to Europeans who have been on missions to Abomey, that even were he desirous of doing so, he could not discontinue that perpetual series of human sacrifices in which his people delight; that his prestige would be gone, and that he in his turn would be a victim if he ceased to justify by deeds his title of ""Man-slayer."" There is possibly truth in this. The people, like their King, are accustomed to sniff the, to them, intoxicating odour of the reeking blood of victims slaughtered before their eyes, and would object to be deprived of a gratification they have so long enjoyed. Under such circumstances there is only one way of purifying the horribly polluted atmosphere of Dahomey, and that is by bringing a superior force to bear upon King, people, and institutions. As already stated, we have ourselves always held the opinion that it was the duty of a civilized Christian Power such as Great Britain to interfere in the interests of humanity. There are now other interests, in addition to those of mere humanity, urging and impelling to the work. Not only has one of her subjects been grievously maltreated, but the financial interests of the Gold Coast Colony are very prejudicially interfered with by the action of Dahomey as a marauding State. The yearly armed expeditions into the Egba territories, even up to the immediate neighbourhood of Abeokuta, in quest of plunder and victims for sacrifice in the ""Customs,"" inflict very great injury not only on the industrious Egba agriculturists, but also, as a necessary result, on the revenues of Lagos. There is an annual scare in the Egba territories. Farms are deserted, the people take refuge in Abeokuta, and their property is wasted and destroyed. We feel sure that we do not exaggerate when we say that were those marauding inroads to cease, and to cease at the absurd certainty that there will not be any renewal of them, agricultural industry will take so great a development in the Egba countries that the production would be doubled, with corresponding advantage to the', 'last_edit_date': '1876-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1876#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Friend to the King of Dahomey', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The ""ocular testimony"" that he speaks of in reference to African kings being in advance of their subjects must relate to those on the East or the South Coast of Africa, anywhere else than the Western Coast, decidedly not on the Gold Coast or in the Bights.

About the period that the Rev. William West, the superintendent of the Wesleyan Mission on the Gold Coast, was at Coomassie on a visit to the King, in company with the Rev. John Osco Ansah (an Ashantee prince) and Mr. Ghartey, a report was brought to his Majesty that a woman in a neighbouring village had made use of his great oath without sufficient cause. Quaku Duah at once despatched his executioner with his staff to the said village with orders (I need not say *strict or positive orders*, as in Coomassie all orders are positive and irrevocable) to slay every man, woman, child, sheep, goat, dog, fowl, and living creature therein, and to raze the place to the ground, and scatter salt over the ruins. *These orders were executed literally.* For the truth of this I refer to the three gentlemen named above.

Prince Duke then joined the chiefs, and they all advanced to the seat occupied by Consul Hopkins, who, with his wife and several Europeans, was present as the representative of the Queen. The ""music"" ceased, and perfect quietness reigned while the chiefs presented the Prince to Mr. Hopkins as the future King of Old Calabar. This was the signal for a demonstration of the most extraordinary character. The whole company rose _en masse_, shouted, screamed, jumped and yelled as only Africans can, and then the dancing began afresh and became general. The King-elect was attired in a robe of bright-coloured cloth, an admiral\'s worn-out hat, with a white feather sticking in it, covering his head. He carried a silver spear, and a live fowl, tied by the leg to a long string which his majesty held, fluttered on the ground before him. A brush of peacock\'s feathers, some five or six feet long, was suspended from his back to represent a tail. Some of the native costumes were ludicrous in the extreme. Discarded naval and military uniforms were the favourites, on account of their bright colours. Big negroes wore little coats, the sleeves of which did not reach further than their elbows, and they were tied with string in front to draw them close to the body; others again, of small stature, wore large coats, and the result was often that, when the collars were turned up, very little of the wearer\'s inside could be seen. During the progress of the dancing a good deal of commotion and some terror was caused amongst the natives by the sudden appearance of one of the members of a secret society known as ""Egbo men."" This is a society to which at present only two white men are known to belong, all the rest being natives. Its members are selected with very great care, and the main object of the organization is understood to be to obtain justice in their dealings with others. If a member has a transaction with a native, and the latter fails in any momentary obligation he may have incurred, the matter is mentioned before the heads of the society, and the offender is seized and imprisoned until the amount is paid. About eleven o\'clock every night a horn is blown, which sounds all over the town, and on hearing this an ""Egbo man,"" with a bell tied to him, and with a number of followers attending him, starts to scour the whole place, and if anybody, be it man, woman, or child, is found abroad at that hour, they receive prompt punishment, and very often most serious personal injury is thus inflicted. As with secret societies in England, the Egbo men have their strict rules and regulations; the meetings are conducted with closed doors, and each member is sworn not to divulge anything of the proceedings. When the Egbo man referred to appeared at the dance, the upper portion of his body was encased in armour, and his legs were covered with elaborate bead-work; he wore a mask to conceal his features, and had a bunch of feathers behind him as a tail, to which was attached his bell, the sound of which, when he makes his nightly journeys, is so terrifying to the inhabitants. After his disappearance from the scene, the natives resumed their dancing, which was kept up till nightfall, when they all retired to another enclosed space, where the ceremony of burning an effigy of Satan brought the day\'s rejoicings to an end.', 'last_edit_date': '1879-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1879#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Chiefs and Kings of the Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—The interest which your journal has always taken in the affairs of West Africa induces me to solicit a space for the insertion of this article, which I trust will not fail to lead to an amelioration of the state of things, by its being brought to the knowledge of those whom it concerns.\n\nOne of the results of the Ashanti Campaign was to bring the countries on the Gold Coast under the control or protection of the British Government. The countries on the sea-coast are divided into districts, to each of which a Commissioner is appointed by the Governor. The interior countries, however, are not thus provided for, but are left to be ruled by their chiefs and kings, as formerly. The authority of these kings and chiefs was not formally acknowledged, and any offence which, according to custom, is visited with severe punishment, is immediately reported to the Government authorities on the sea-coast; and the chieftain or king who ordered the punishment is brought before the Court and treated as the commonest fellow.\n\nThis action on the part of the Government terrifies and paralyzes a good many of these chiefs and kings, so that in a great many instances the wicked go unpunished. On the other hand, others use the name of the Government to acquire territories which they have not the least right to. Amongst these I may mention the name of one ""Sakiaty,"" who is of great notoriety in Eastern Croboe, interior of Accra. This man was a chief of Odumase, a country of Eastern Croboe, before the Ashanti Campaign, but immediately after the war, he assumed the authority and title of king, which he said was vested in him by Sir John Glover for the valuable services he rendered in the war. Not contented with the throne which he has thus usurped, he is now intriguing to acquire Western Croboe also. The present king of Western Croboe, who is now being molested, forbears to say anything, lest his opposition may end in a contest, and he may be thereby brought to the sea-coast and treated with ignominy. But there is sure to come a successor who will dispute every inch of ground that ""Sakiaty"" has thus acquired. This will undoubtedly end in strife, when people will have the mortification again to see that their royalties are treated contemptuously by those who are their protectors. If the present system of government in the interior countries is to continue, I would, Sir, respectfully recommend that the following plans be carried out: (1) that every chieftain or king in the interior should prove his claim; (2) that the right of government by native chiefs and kings in the interior, so far as it is compatible with common sense and humanity, be proclaimed as supported by the British authorities on the sea-coast; and (3), that any unnecessary interference and aggression of one chief or king with another, be met with the highest displeasure of the Governor.', 'last_edit_date': '1880-06-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_08_1880#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.613, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'How to Treat Dahomey', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""We observe by our English journals, received per Ethiope, that the friends of Africa in England are greatly bestirring themselves in favour of our country.

Euro-African contacts, which until the beginning of our period had been confined largely to the coastal peripheries, were, in the period under review, steadily extended inland as a result of the Industrial Revolution, largely through the efforts first of explorers, then traders and, finally, missionaries. This steady extension of European contacts and influence inland included not only guns and powder, but also railways, telegraphs, agricultural and mining machinery, the print› ing press, technical education and, above all, finance capital. These new developments created opportunities, but also challenges and dangers. Among the most novel and interesting features of African history during the period were the initiatives and reactions of African rulers and advisers in the face of these opportunities and challenges. It would appear that in most cases the approach of the Africans was not simply one of blind imitation or wholesale substitution but rather one of adaptation and syn› thesis. Instances of this process of modernization in Africa are legion. 56 Egypt built its first printing press at Büläk, Cairo, in 1822; the first printing press was established in Portuguese Luanda in 1841; the first modern mines were opened in Algeria in 1845 and in the Gold Coast in the 1870s. Some of the states, such as Ethiopia and Tunisia, embarked on public works; nearly all the Barbary states, as well as Egypt reformed their monetary systems. Other states, such as Egypt, set up textile and cotton mills, saw mills, glassworks and paper mills, all during the reign of Muhammad 'AIL But more interesting and of far-reaching consequence was the moder› nization process in the military sphere. In the face of steady European encroachment, many African states, especially in North and West Africa, modernized the organization, training, equipment and recruitment of their armies. As will be seen in later chapters, Morocco, for instance, set up at Fez an engineering school to train artillery men, surveyors, and car› tographers and sent soldiers abroad for training.

But the new governors were overthrown and replaced by pre-existing dynasties during widespread revolts against his increasingly harsh rule. 20 The similarities between Liberia's and Ethiopia's political systems were too obvious from the analysis thus far to belabour. Besides possessing a core and periphery, and a central government, each had sub-political systems centred on local chiefdoms (or villages) like those of the Gola in Liberia or the Oromo ('Galla') in Ethiopia not discussed in this chapter, with political cultures more or less different from the dominant political culture at the centre. Both systems were solidly based on privilege at the core, and extensively utilized patronage and assimilation techniques.

Elsewhere in Africa we have to begin at the very beginning. There can be no doubt of its wealth and power, even so late as the ascendancy of the Portuguese in these parts, as attested by the castles, palaces, and churches built here by European skill, at the cost of the native princes. Since then, however, it has been literally torn in pieces by internal convulsions, and might possibly even have disappeared from the list of nations, but for the sudden rise of its present king, who, in the course of a few years, has not merely put down all the contending chiefs who perpetually fought for the ascendancy in Amhara and Tigre, but reduced the late sovereignty of Shoa to its original subjugation to the rule of Gondai. Thus Abyssinia is so far become one.\n\n""The King is at the same time rapidly prosecuting internal reforms. He has at this moment lay missionaries at his court attached to the Jerusalem Mission. They are making roads, teaching carpentering, and so forth, and are very well treated. This shows his good will to Europeans.\n\n""I shall have to write to you further, but will you kindly tell me whether the African-Aid Society, or any other, would undertake to give a medical education to a certain number of lads from this country, at Malta or elsewhere?

He then adds: ""A rebellion, headed by a chief named Tissoo Gabazai, had broken out in different parts of the country, and it is not improbable that this circumstance may have rendered the roads unsafe towards the coast. So great, moreover, is the dread of the King\'s displeasure, that Abyssinians arriving from the interior scrupulously avoid all intercourse with Europeans. Hence it is very difficult to obtain any reliable information respecting the state of things at Gondar, and every attempt to communicate privately with Captain Cameron and the other British captives has proved unsuccessful. It appears that our unfortunate countrymen are confined in a tent next to that of the King, and all intercourse with them is strictly forbidden under the severest penalties. Besides this vigilant watch, each European is chained to a trustworthy dependent of the royal household, the latter being relieved at short intervals. The chain is never more than four feet long, so that the prisoner can scarcely move without the knowledge of the guard, and vice versa."" Mr. Bassam finished by expressing his determination to go up to Gondar, should there be the most distant hope of his obtaining an interview with King Theodorus.\n\nThe Bengal Hurkuru, published at Calcutta, November 12, says:—\n\n""King Theodore, we learn, on the receipt of Her Majesty the Queen\'s letter, delivered to him by Mr. Bassam, relative to the release of the European gentlemen confined in Abyssinia, remarked, \'Kings ought to write to kings, but no subordinates\' (governors).

The captives, Messrs. Stern, Rosenthal, and the English Consul, have not only not been set at liberty, but have suffered from great violence. According to information, received from different authorities, the prisoners find themselves placed in the most pitiful condition, as the rainy season has gravely affected their health. The ostensible cause of ill-treatment on the part of the King seems to lie in the discovery which his Majesty made in the journal of Messrs. Stern and Rosenthal as to his maternal descent. Mr. Stern mentions in his confiscated paper that the King\'s mother had been a vendor of kosso, a medicinal fruit that is constantly used by the Abyssinians. Mr. Stern was quite right in his assertion, for it is true that the King\'s mother was a seller of kosso, whereas his father was a relation of Dedjaji Comfoo, the governor of Dembea, who beat back several times the Egyptian troops that came from Senaar. In the beginning of his reign the King (who was then a kind and liberal man, and not a despot, as he has become since the death of Mr. Bell, his adjutant, who kept him in a moral check) often used to say, ""If I do not help the poor people they will complain of me before God, for I myself have been a poor man."" Had Theodoros been a man of Napoleon\'s stamp, he would not have felt ashamed of his descent, nor would he have had recourse to the absurd idea of being descended from King Solomon, who had a son, as the Abyssinians say, called Menelik, who was sent to Ethiopia, which was then subjected to the Queen of Sheba. Hence the Royal Family of Abyssinia consider themselves to this day the lineal descendants of Solomon, an idea to which King Theodoros attaches the greatest importance, and which he is said to have strongly stated in his late correspondence with Napoleon to outdo the latter in respect of genealogy. Theodoros, very angry at Mr. Stern\'s assertion, wished to know the source from which he had derived his information. As he would not mention the name of his informant, the King ordered him and Mr. Rosenthal to be beaten and put to the Abyssinian rack—i.e., the wrist of the hand and upper part of the arm of both gentlemen were firmly tied with ropes, in consequence of which the blood was forced out of the tips of the fingers After the prisoners had confessed the rack was removed, but one may imagine how dreadfully they suffered.

Stecker, who was a member of Rohlfs\' expedition to Africa in 1878, and travelled through Abyssinia up to the spring of 1881, lately gave a lecture at a geographical meeting in Munich on the importance of Abyssinia and Galla to Europe. The lecturer said that when he parted from King John of Abyssinia, that monarch complained bitterly of the indifference, and even enmity, shown by the European Powers, especially England. (Of course, this was before the late mission from England.) When Munzinger occupied many provinces of Abyssinia with his Egyptian troops, and his son Hassan made a predatory raid into that country, England looked on quietly, and the deputation sent by King John to England was not received by the Queen, but when it was reported that he was about to march on Massowah England at once forwarded a man-of-war to oppose the supposed movement. At that time King John observed to Dr. Stecker that it seemed Europe thought him an incapable boy. He wanted nothing but the three provinces of Hogos, Mensu, and Massowah, to which he had a title, which, once in his possession, would be of great value to the development of culture in Abyssinia. Should the Emperor be placed in possession of these provinces, he would no doubt be ready to send against the Mahdi an army much more efficient than the Egyptian troops. Dr. Stecker spoke in very advantageous terms of King John. He was by no means the cruel tyrant and hater of all that is European as he was described to be by certain travellers, but, on the contrary, he had a great sympathy for Europeans. If he had sometimes shown himself suspicious, it was the Europeans\' own fault, as the lecturer had frequently occasion to observe. For example, a European once brought to the Court of King John, with the intention of ""letting"" her out to him, a ""lady"" well known in Alexandria; as soon as the King heard of it, he banished the ""lady"" from his country. He was justly and deeply offended, because he really led an unusually pure and almost monastic life. Another European threw his hat in the King\'s face, which offensive act was afterwards solemnly pardoned by the Monarch in full assembly. A third European struck the King\'s Prime Minister with his riding whip, and certain missionaries had accepted the King\'s protection and afterwards conspired with his enemies against him. Dr. Stecker enthusiastically described King John\'s sense of justice, benevolence, and love of knowledge, declaring him to be the very man to open a path for European civilization into the Dark Continent. The climate of Abyssinia was so healthy that excellent sanitary stations might be established there. Even in the highest points the thermometer seldom fell below zero. The country was most interesting for geologists, geographers, and pharmacologists, as it possessed a number of healing plants unknown to Europe, among them being an antidote for hydrophobia. King John would no doubt be ready to welcome European colonists, especially Germans. If the King possessed Massowah, an uncommonly rich field would be open to commerce. Dr. Stecker further described his own travels. He had penetrated into regions hitherto untrod by European feet. He was once captured as a spy by the King of Shoah, and treated in anything but a gentle manner. When within three days\' journey of the Kaffaland he was obliged to turn back, as his guides refused to go into that dangerous country. He accompanied King John on his march into Galla, which country no European had ever entered till then.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1885#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""KING JA-JA'S LADY ADVISER"", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A young lady of Kentucky, by name Emma Johnson, emigrated some time ago from her native state in America to Liberia in West Africa. Her object no doubt was to better herself, and in this she would appear—if the achievement of political ambition brings any satisfaction with it—to have succeeded. For Emma Johnson is now First Lord of the Treasury and Grand Vizier to His Most West African Majesty Ja-Ja, King of Liberia and the Cameroons, and Suzerain Lord Paramount of Equatorial Germany. The Daily Telegraph says: ""Is not this enough to content even feminine claims to occupation in the higher grades—the portfolio of a Minister of State, the privileges of a Privy Councillor, the ennobling anxieties of statesmanship, the precious responsibilities of patronage? What sphere more suitable for the assertion of Woman\'s Rights than this, wherein, as the First Lady of the Land, she represents in her own individual person the cumulative suffrages of the whole of her sex, and, by virtue of her office, dictates to King Ja-Ja and his masculine subjects from the platform of female supremacy, holding Liberia, as if it were only one wretched man, under the pleasing thraldom of a woman\'s will? His Majesty, it may be remembered, signed the other day a treaty with the Court of Berlin, by which eight rivers and the territory which they water were placed under the German flag. This convention, however, did not please the people; so what did they do? They whipped their King. The poor Sovereign, because he had granted Prince Bismarck the right to establish colonies in the Cameroons, was actually flogged by his subjects. Now, even in the most Constitutional Monarchy, this measure must be considered an extreme step. Boxing a King\'s ears in order to correct his foreign policy is in its way a novelty; for, though no doubt there have been many titular Monarchs who have been governed by their Queen Consorts—and, if the truth were told, have had their faces slapped by them—this is probably the first time that a reigning Sovereign has been flogged for exercising what he was pleased to consider his prerogatives. It has been said that \'divinity does hedge a king\'; but in Liberia the fence would appear to be somewhat defective, and the \'right divine to govern wrong\' to be tempered with an occasional application of cudgels. Of course a great deal may be excused in officials and functionaries who draw their salary at irregular intervals, in cocoa-nuts or birds\'-skins; but it seems an unnecessary high-handed procedure when the chiefs of the Cameroons, simply because they disapprove of German annexation, go and thump their King. Large questions of foreign policy should admit, so it seems to us, of more regular methods of settlement, and even Liberia might devise some more becoming mode of condemning Teutonic colonisation than whipping their Sovereign.

The Aquamoos have been, as you are aware, enemies of the tribes within the Protectorate for many years past, and have been the prime instigators of all the wars and disturbances on the Volta and in the Eastern districts for eight years. It was the Aquamoos who invited the King of Ashanti to send his armies down to devastate the Eastern districts in 1869 and 1870, and to carry off the European traders in Crepee, and half the inhabitants of that country, into captivity, after lamentable atrocities in the line of murder and devastation.\n\nAlthough the Aquamoos gave the British Government two hostages as a guarantee for the restoration of the Europeans so treacherously seized by the Ashantis and themselves in Crepee in June, 1869, yet they have never ceased to do us harm when they had it in their power to do so, and the European prisoners are still in captivity at Coomassie. One of these hostages effected his escape about six months ago, and proceeded direct to Aquamoo, since which he has been employed by the King of Aquamoo as agent for the purchase of arms and munitions of war for the Ashantis from the traders in Porgs.

How has King Ja Ja been treated unjustly, and what is the breach of faith of which you have reason to complain?\'\n\n""Deputation: \'King Ja Ja of Opobo is a Sovereign with whom England has concluded a treaty as lately as 1887. The first treaty was that of 1873, which gave Ja Ja power to fine all European traders who attempted to trade beyond certain defined limits in his territory. The treaty of 1884, concluded after the Berlin Congress, established a protectorate over Opobo. All went well until 1886, when, trade in palm oil being depressed, traders wished to get rid of the middlemen and trade directly beyond the districts opened to Europeans in Opobo.

Similarly, The African Times articles provide instances of leadership changes and disputes, such as the elective monarchy system where kingship is limited to four or five years, leading to auctions and potential conflicts. The death of King Quow Daddy of Aquapim and the subsequent human sacrifices and succession disputes, as well as the fears of conflict among princes following King Massah of Nupe's death, underscore the instability following a leader's demise. The turmoil in New Calabar with multiple aspirants to the throne, the deposition of King Ja Ja of Opobo, and the disputes involving King Koffee Calcalli of Ashanti further demonstrate how succession disputes and leadership changes can lead to political instability and power struggles.

During the reign of the Mulopwe Kasongo Kalombo (c. 1870-80), its political superstructure began to give way to the pressure exercised in particular by trading caravans from the Swahili area or from Angola. This commercial penetration merely fanned the flames of dissensions between different political leaders on the one hand, and on the other, between the political chiefs themselves and between the latter and chiefs of families which owned land and domains.

There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority.

Brutal massacres and secessionist move› ments were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority...

The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings.

Though, as both A. E. Afigbo and G. N. Uzoigwe have shown (Chapters 2 and 19), the boundaries of the states that emerged were not as arbitrary as is generally believed, there is no doubt that many of the states that emerged were artificial creations, and this artificiality has created a number of problems that are bound to bedevil the future development of the continent. The first of these is the fact that some of these boundaries cut across pre-existing ethnic groups, states and kingdoms and this has caused widespread social disruption and displace› ment. The Bakongo are, for instance, found divided by the boundaries of Angola, Belgian Congo (now Zaire), French Congo (now Congo) and Gabon. Today, some of the Ewe live in Ghana, some in Togo and some in Benin; the Somali are shared among Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti; the Senufo are found in Mali, Ivory Coast and Upper Volta. The examples can be multiplied. One important consequence of this situation has been the chronic border disputes that have plagued the relations between some independent African states - such as those between Sudan and Uganda; between Somalia and Ethiopia; between Kenya and Somalia; between Ghana and Togo; and between Nigeria and Cameroon. Secondly, because of the arbitrary nature of these boundaries, each African nation-state is made up of a medley of peoples with different cultures, traditions of origin and language.

The search for more stable political structures had been going on throughout the nineteenth century and indeed before then as part of the general evolution of the peoples. Perhaps there was a quickening of the pace, and changes hitherto associated with the rise of states like Old Oyo in the seventeenth century or Asante, Dahomey, Futa Jallon, Futa Toro and Bondu in the eighteenth century became more general in the nineteenth century.

It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

For by then both the political and religious leadership of the traditional societies had been conquered, colon› ized and humiliated. The traditional kings had been supplanted by an alien Secretary for Native Affairs such as Theophilus Shepstone in Natal, or the so-called 'Native Commissioners' and 'Native Departments' elsewhere. The African masses were primarily recognized as the 'black problem' and were, as Jabavu described them, 'landless, voteless, helots, pariahs, social outcasts in their fatherland with no future in any path of life'.$^{14}$ Further- more, these were the first Africans to face the crisis in identity$^{15}$ created by new artificial colonial boundaries which partitioned cultural-linguistichistorical groups, by cultural shock in mining and farming compounds, the homes of the whites, and in Christian churches and schools throughout the settler-dominated world."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.616, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic tensions > Social change', 'content': ""Other types of tension became more accentuated in the centralized states during this period, namely Asante, the Bambara kingdoms, Yatenga, the kingdom of Wagadugu and Gwiriko: all of these witnessed rivalry between the lordly or noble class and the ruler. Such a rivalry occurred in the kingdom of Wagadugu, where Mogho Naaba Karfo (1842-9) decided to distribute to the poor among the common people the property that he had confiscated from the wealthy. In dispensing justice, he was accessible to noble and commoner alike. It is highly likely that this social policy was a factor in the great rebellion of the princes that broke out in his reign at the instigation of the most important of his ministers, the Widi Naaba.\nLastly, we may mention the coastal lands, where the driving forces of trade and education were producing a qualitatively new type of social stratification. Once the basis of commercial activity had shifted from the slave trade to the exchange of palm oil, rubber, ivory and gold for European products, a new merchant class emerged, operating with stocks of trade goods advanced by European companies, whose agents they actually were. Thus began the careers of a number of great merchants with establishments in the coastal centres. At a lower level, swarms of petty dealers who played the role of door-to-door salesmen to the suppliers gravitated around the great merchants, on whom they were dependent.$^{62}$ The Asante merchants who, for their part, controlled the supply of products from the interior of Africa, namely the akonkofo, also constituted a factor to be reckoned with. 63 In much the same way, in the field of education new categories, or even entire social classes, came into being along the coast. At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone. These people were regarded as 'English gentlemen', and behaved accordingly. They were accepted in European circles and rose to positions of responsibility as magistrates, commanders of forts and the like. At the other end of the scale were the great mass of persons known ironically as 'Cape Coast scholars', who had received only rudimentary education."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.615, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': ""Because of their exclusion, the new elites went into open opposition against the colonial powers. In this open opposition the traditional rulers could not join them. Their continued survival depended on the colonial power and this tied their hands. Also for the most part the traditional rulers were not sufficiently educated to participate meaningfully in the highfaluting debates of the new elites. In any case if they accepted the arguments of the new elites, they would be consigning themselves to second or even third place. Because they did not side with the new elites, the latter regarded them as the lackeys of imperialism. They in turn regarded the new elites as revolutionaries who wanted to destroy im› memorial custom and turn the world upside down.\nTo make matters worse the two were driven by imperialist propaganda into engaging in a struggle over who spoke for the people. The new elites said they did. This the traditional rulers denied, claiming the honour for themselves. The colonial administration agreed with them. The kind of acrimony which this disagreement at times generated could be seen in the dispute between the chief of Akyem-Abuakwa in the Gold Coast, Nana Sir Ofori Atta and the leaders of the National Congress of British West Africa in the 1920s. It could also be seen in the same period in the quarrel between Harry Thuku's Young Kikuyu Association on the one hand, and the Kikuyu Association dominated by the traditional rulers on the other. 7\nYet one cannot conclude from the foregoing that in the period 1880 to 1935 the normal relationship between the new elites and the traditional rulers was invariably one of conflict. The nature of the relationship varied both in place and time. In the French territories neither the new elites nor the traditional rulers flourished under alien rule.

The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.62, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Patterns of authority', 'content': ""These two models were complementary, and in practice there were many kinds of intermediate situations, waverings and compromises.

Most obviously, traditional functions were distended by new demands, such as the collection of taxes, the taking of censuses, or the recruitment of labour and military conscripts. Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

The insurgents gained additional adherents when a 'prophet', Matemu-a-Kenenia, revealed that the ancestors had instructed Africans to kill or destroy all white animals and objects in the land as well as all symbols of European rule as a prelude to divine intervention and the end of white domination. The movement attracted widespread support, but it was immediately suppressed, and more than 400 Pende and one European lost their lives in the process. 42 Other religious-political movements attracted even larger peasant followings, which may be partly due to the fact that the colonial authorities had imposed a strict ban on political organizations.

In Uganda, shortly after the commencement of hostilities, Nyindo, Paramount Chief of Kigezi, was persuaded by his half-brother, the Mwami of Ruanda, to revolt against the British on behalf of the Germans. 43 In many cases, and notably Nigeria, wartime revolts were not directly attributable to specific wartime measures.

We were invited to sit down under a large tree on two old chairs, which perhaps once had seen better days, for they were English. Mr. M. exclaimed at the want of punctuality, and declared we would only stay twenty minutes, when, if the King did not arrive, we would return. Now, imagine us sitting side by side (I in my best blue jacket and a pair of scarlet plaid trousers, and a fireaway cap; Mr. M. in a costume of equal splendour), with a few hundred blackies round about, one face behind another, like an assemblage at a circus. We did our best to contain ourselves and behave with due gravity, seeing that all were silent and respectful—the elders who came forth to meet us at our feet reclining on mats. I looked at my shoes, and Mr. M. ditto; but accidentally raising his eyes, they fell on the countenance of an old woman, who was sitting smoking a pipe. He touched me, and whispered, ""Look on your left, in the second row, at that old woman."" I did look, and it was too much; I burst out laughing, and he also. Such a funny face I never beheld—so serious and yet so comic. She was puffing out smoke through her nose, and seemed so absorbed in contemplating us, there seemed such a mixture of absurdity and consequence about her, that it was inimitable. I exclaimed, ""O for Hogarth\'s pencil! What would I not give for a sketch!"" The ice being broken, we both looked about us, and certainly we had a rich treat in quizzing them. Our twenty minutes being nearly up, we determined to give them only ten minutes more of our company, and then off. At the stated moment up we jumped, and a great scamper there was. I suppose they thought we were going to eat them, for they fled in all directions, except some of the older and wiser ones, who pressed us to stay, for that the King was certainly on the road, and would shortly arrive. We would not; for I wanted to proceed further, and view the country, especially as a high hill was at no great distance, and I wished to mount it, and feel again as if in my own country. None can imagine how dear a hill is, when long used to flat plains, or the monotony of the sea. We mounted our hammocks and went in the direction. Our guide told us we should have to pass through another town, where dwelt a former king (now deposed) but still retaining the title ""King Tom."" In this country the monarchy is elective, and one man cannot reign beyond four or five years, when the throne is put up for auction, and knocked down to the highest bidder, if the rest of the people are satisfied; but if two parties arise, then there is a small palaver, and a small war—a few men get killed, and the victorious chief is made king. Well, this old King was at home, and after we had sat down at the entrance of the town, to give him time for dressing, he sent us word he was ready, and we must proceed. We went forward, and was soon in the presence of his august Majesty. He wore an old faded blue and red cotton velvet cloak, trimmed with brass lace, a present from some former trader in slaves, I suppose. He was sitting at the door of his hut with a mat spread, and a low bench placed for us to occupy. He shook hands, and said in good English, he was glad to see us. He was a fine old man, with a flowing white beard, and the most intelligent native I have seen. He could converse well; spoke, in addition to English, French and Portuguese. He told us how many presents he had received from different white men when he was in power, and amongst other curiosities showed us a small Bible which an American captain had given him. It was half eaten away with ants and worms, and he certainly had no more idea of its contents or knowledge of religion than a stone. We gave the old King the presents we had intended for the other, and we told him we wished to ascend the hill and view the country. He immediately tried to dissuade us, and told us no white man had ever been up. One only (a Spaniard), a long time ago, attempted it, and for his temerity he got his reward—""he never came down to tell what he saw, for a snake chopped him."" We were highly amused at this story, and if we needed any further spur to induce us to be off, this would have been enough, for we felt that there was some hidden cause for his objecting to our going, and our curiosity was excited to the utmost. We had no sooner declared our determination, than plenty of volunteers were ready to accompany us, and we found there was no cause for any fears. A tolerable footpath led right up to the top, and half-an-hour presented us with the noblest scene I think I ever beheld. Far down below our feet was the river which we now saw for the first time winding along, its banks verdant with corn and every production of a tropical clime. Oranges and limes, cotton and sugar cane, all growing wild in great luxuriance. We could trace it far inland, now hidden with trees, and then again shining bright like a sheet of silver. It seemed not like a continued stream, but a succession of small lakes, each one more beautiful than the other. Sometimes it was lost for a long distance by wooded hills, and then again you caught a peep of it afar off, until, at last, it was hidden beyond a range of lofty mountains. We were both entranced, and could only say, ""How beautiful!"" ""How beautiful!"" Our next wish was that we could trace it to its source, and sadly lamented that business would not allow it at present. After we had drunk in all the beauties of the prospect we descended to the river\'s bank, and a difficult task it was, all rocky and thick bushwood. I led the way (for I flatter myself few can excel me up or down a mountain track). Every moment we started a monkey, which would skip about from pinnacle to pinnacle, and chatter and grin as if in derision of our clumsiness. After many hairbreadth escapes we got to the bottom, regaled ourselves with some wild water melons, and continued our course down the river side. Not far off we discovered a canoe anchored near the bank. We determined to embark, and find out the depth of the water in the middle of the stream, and if it were navigable for a vessel of any burthen. In we jumped, Mr. M. taking one paddle and I another. We went along famously, and found, by the aid of a long stick, that the depth was considerable, being upwards of twelve feet. Having landed again, we journeyed on, a few of the natives who had kept with us being our guides. By a long circuitous route we reached the town where our own men, hammocks, &c., were in waiting. His Majesty sent his compliments, and would be glad if we would stay and dine with him; but being tired, and a long way from our house, we declined the honour, and once more got into our hammocks, and went off on a gallop, pursued by all the idle boys and dogs in the village, and (shall I tell it?) the ladies had lost their bashfulness, and came scampering along laughing, and evidently highly amused. At last, making an exceedingly ungraceful curtsey, they said, in their language, as our interpreter informed us, ""Farewell, white man."" We got safe home, and I need not say, we were ready for dinner.'}, {'id': 893, 'article_title': 'Human Sacrifices in the Accra District', 'full_section_title': 'Human Sacrifices in the Accra District', 'last_edit_date': '07-10-1866', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1866#article-9', 'issue_date': '23_08_1866', 'content': ""Sir,—Quow Daddy, the King of Aquapim, is dead, and many human beings have been sacrificed to accompany him to the next world.\n\nAquapim is in the protectorate, and only one day's journey on foot from Accra, about thirty miles.

They refused. He fined them $40 each. They refused to pay. He and his men attacked one of the traders with their cutlasses and nearly cut his arm off; the rest took their guns and prepared to fight. The Prince, a mere boy, then went off to another town to get more men. The traders sent off to Bassi—a port near by—to the representative of one of the merchants.

In honour of the funeral of Quacow Duah, 300 of his subjects were killed. Immediately afterwards Koffee Kalkalli, who was King of Ashanti at the time of the war in 1873, and was subsequently deposed, was found dead in his bed, having been murdered, as is generally believed, although it was given out that he died from apoplexy after partaking of a hearty meal. The successor to the throne will, it is supposed, be Mensah, who was king up to a few months ago, but who was deposed on account of his barbarous cruelties. In view of the terror which this belief has inspired, the Ashantee chiefs have sent a deputation to the Governor of Cape Coast Castle, asking that their country shall be annexed to the British protectorate. The murderers of King Koffee Kalkalli have been discovered, but are defended by a powerful party.

The countries on the sea-coast are divided into districts, to each of which a Commissioner is appointed by the Governor. The interior countries, however, are not thus provided for, but are left to be ruled by their chiefs and kings, as formerly. The authority of these kings and chiefs was not formally acknowledged, and any offence which, according to custom, is visited with severe punishment, is immediately reported to the Government authorities on the sea-coast; and the chieftain or king who ordered the punishment is brought before the Court and treated as the commonest fellow.\n\nThis action on the part of the Government terrifies and paralyzes a good many of these chiefs and kings, so that in a great many instances the wicked go unpunished. On the other hand, others use the name of the Government to acquire territories which they have not the least right to. Amongst these I may mention the name of one ""Sakiaty,"" who is of great notoriety in Eastern Croboe, interior of Accra. This man was a chief of Odumase, a country of Eastern Croboe, before the Ashanti Campaign, but immediately after the war, he assumed the authority and title of king, which he said was vested in him by Sir John Glover for the valuable services he rendered in the war. Not contented with the throne which he has thus usurped, he is now intriguing to acquire Western Croboe also. The present king of Western Croboe, who is now being molested, forbears to say anything, lest his opposition may end in a contest, and he may be thereby brought to the sea-coast and treated with ignominy. But there is sure to come a successor who will dispute every inch of ground that ""Sakiaty"" has thus acquired. This will undoubtedly end in strife, when people will have the mortification again to see that their royalties are treated contemptuously by those who are their protectors. If the present system of government in the interior countries is to continue, I would, Sir, respectfully recommend that the following plans be carried out: (1) that every chieftain or king in the interior should prove his claim; (2) that the right of government by native chiefs and kings in the interior, so far as it is compatible with common sense and humanity, be proclaimed as supported by the British authorities on the sea-coast; and (3), that any unnecessary interference and aggression of one chief or king with another, be met with the highest displeasure of the Governor.', 'last_edit_date': '1880-06-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_08_1880#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.573, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Revolt in Ashanti', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""On the 10th inst. a messenger arrived from the King of Ashanti to the Administrator, to inform him that the Kings of Juabin and Becqueh were in revolt, and refused to attend Calcali's summons to view his return to the capital, and, further, that they threatened to attack him if he attempted to use force.

How has King Ja Ja been treated unjustly, and what is the breach of faith of which you have reason to complain?\'\n\n""Deputation: \'King Ja Ja of Opobo is a Sovereign with whom England has concluded a treaty as lately as 1887. The first treaty was that of 1873, which gave Ja Ja power to fine all European traders who attempted to trade beyond certain defined limits in his territory. The treaty of 1884, concluded after the Berlin Congress, established a protectorate over Opobo. All went well until 1886, when, trade in palm oil being depressed, traders wished to get rid of the middlemen and trade directly beyond the districts opened to Europeans in Opobo. To this King Ja Ja objected. Consul Hewitt had assured him that by the protectorate the Queen did not want to take his country or his markets; that she had no wish to disturb his rule. Nevertheless, because King Ja Ja refused to allow the European traders to break the express terms of his treaty by trading directly in the reserved region, he has been first fined, then his trade has been destroyed, and lastly, he has been arrested under circumstances of great treachery by Consul Johnston, and carried off a prisoner to the Gold Coast.

As matters have come to such a crisis, perhaps you will allow me to lay before your readers some details of the whole matter in dispute, by which they may be better able to judge whether such arrest was really justified by the facts.\n\nAfter the famous Berlin Conference of 1884, it was arranged by the British authorities that some one should be sent out to the Oil Rivers to proclaim a Protectorate on behalf of Great Britain over the whole district; and accordingly a gentleman was sent out as Consul, who was empowered to sign a treaty with the native kings and chiefs of the various places, of which Opobo, where Ja Ja is King, was one. One of the conditions of the treaty which Ja Ja signed (Article 6) expressly prohibited strangers going to the interior markets; this condition being further substantiated by a letter from the Consul to Ja Ja; the effect and intention of this being to secure that the European agents should only obtain their goods from the interior through Ja Ja and his chiefs.\n\nAbout two years ago, owing to the depression in the oil trade, some of these agents agreed among themselves that the price of the oil and other native productions should be reduced; and Ja Ja accordingly was communicated with upon the subject, and he expressed his readiness to accept their terms; but that the ""topside"" (a general term among the traders there, meaning commission) should be allowed to him and his chiefs, as before. This the agents would not agree to; they were willing to continue the usual topside to Ja Ja himself, but not to his chiefs. Ja Ja remonstrated with them, and pointed out that Opobo was made by himself and his chiefs. Immediately a white flag was hoisted in five of the factories, which meant that they stop all further business with the natives. One of the firms concerned refused to agree to this suspension, and continued to trade as before.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1887#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.564, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'GAMBIA—ITS ADMINISTRATION AND THREATENED CESSION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—That the settlements in the River Gambia are suffering from being under the management of the Governor of Sierra Leone, or, as he is, in the technical language of Bumbledom, called ""Governor of the West African Settlements,"" is a fact patent to every practical man on the West Coast. That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

The organization was headed by two brothers, Maphutseng and Josiel Lefela, who had formed links with the ANC. 26 The adherents of the Lekhotla la Bafo considered that the British had violated the protectorate agreement with Moshoeshoe and had therefore forfeited any legal claim to Basutoland. Partly because of its very radical stand and partly because from 1928 it began to draw closer to the Com› munist Party of South Africa, it scared the ANC leaders. The British authorities ordered the chiefs to ban the League meetings. But in August 1928 Lekhotla la Bafo staged a protest demonstration in Maseru against the ban. That was the first mass demonstration in Basutoland history and it was attended by several thousand people. When ANC President Gumede returned from his trip to the Soviet Union, Lekhotla la Bafo invited him to address a rally in Basutoland. Subsequently, the organization was for a number of years alleged to be 'an instrument of Moscow' and was persecuted. Still, it continued its activities. 27 The social base of all these early political organizations in Southern Africa was not broad. Often it consisted of the members of the educated elite who had become professionals. The associations and societies did not often have a clear action programme, and were short-lived.

Besides, the Transvaal obstructed the free flow of African labour by permitting the activities of British and colonial land speculators who subsisted on profits from rents paid by the African farm squatters.

The biggest flaw of the articles was their failure to separate legislative functions from executive ones - so that the volksraad tried to exercise both.

Generally speaking these states were peopled by iron-smelting and iron-using farmers, who also produced crops - chiefly sorghum and millets - and engaged in some hunting as well as bartering and long-distance trade. 2\nThe first decades of the nineteenth century witnessed the eruption of a tremendous social and political revolution that tore apart as well as rebuilt the prevailing state system in Bantu-speaking Southern Africa and beyond, as well as transforming the nature and the quality of the lives of many communities from as far afield as the vicinity of Zululand in Natal up to southern Tanzania.

It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Political and social developments in the colonial situation were a product of the interactions between the colonizer on the one hand, and the colonized on the other.

Hence, champions of African nationalism in the inter-war period (wanasiasa as they are known in Swahili) have been referred to as being primarily panAfricanists rather than nationalists in the European sense. The point was that nationalism was taking a reverse course to the expression of the same phenomenon in Europe. Contrary to what happened in Europe, the state was created before the cultural nations that would make it a meaningful political community were welded together. It is in this sense that one should take James Coleman's observation that: ... the drive behind African nationalism in many instances is not the consciousness of belonging to a distinct politico-cultural unit which is seeking to protect or assert itself, but rather it is the movement of racially-conscious modernists seeking to create new political and cultural nationalities out of the heterogenous people within the artificial boundaries imposed by the European master ... '\nWe must recognize that colonialism, as a system of relations, rests upon some kind of racialism, and that since development in a colonial situation is a product of interactions between the colonizer and the colonized, racial consciousness is basic to the growth of nationalism as a search for sovereignty and independence.\nThat African nationalists are regarded as 'modernists' is a reflection of the fact that they were operating within an externally defined setting which imposed alien systems of values, norms, and definitions of political and social developments to which they had to subscribe as a condition for success. That nationalism in Africa is a dynamic, ongoing phenomenon is clear from the extensive literature on themes like nation-building and irredentism.

The Queen\'s Speech to ""my Lords"" and ""faithful Commons"" is remarkable, if for nothing else, at least for the prominence with which African affairs are therein treated. Called together ""after a recess unusually short,"" for the express purpose of giving further consideration to the great subject of the representation of the people, Parliament is advised, not as regards the position and prospects of the famous Franchise Bill, but as to the condition of British interests in one or other portion of the ""Dark Continent."" At least three-fourths of the Royal Message is devoted to explanatory references to General Gordon\'s defence of Khartoum; to the advance of an English force to his rescue; to the measures taken for securing better government in Egypt; to the overt action of the authorities in the Transvaal, and to the co-operation of the Cape Colony with the Home Government, in securing the faithful observance of the Convention. And the allusions, moreover, are capped by the statement—long since anticipated by the critics of the Government—that the operations in the Soudan will render further pecuniary provision necessary. When, last month, attention was drawn in these columns to the urgent manner in which African interests were forcing themselves upon public notice, it was scarcely expected that an official confirmation of our views would be so soon forthcoming. Too long the vast material advantages to be derived by this country from a proper cultivation of the opportunities offering in Africa for Commerce and colonization have been neglected. Now, however, that the Government seem at last to realise, if not wholly, yet in a measure, the importance of the grand possibilities possessed by the Continent for development in practically every direction, it behoves every true friend of Africa to encourage and strengthen this newly-awakened enthusiasm. Judged by the past alone, it would be difficult to give the powers that be much credit for the adoption in the future of any better or more enlightened policy in regard to our African possessions than they have pursued hitherto. But, happily for their prestige in the eyes of the nation—and, indeed, of the world at large—Lord Derby, though at the eleventh hour, has summoned up sufficient courage to peremptorily protest against the annexation, by the Boers, of Montsioa\'s territory. This prompt exhibition of British authority at once secured the desired object—the formal withdrawal of the claims and pretensions of the Transvaal Republic, an effect which those who have so long counselled the adoption of a more spirited policy towards our quasi-Dutch neighbours had confidently predicted. Indeed, President Kruger—speaking on behalf of the Volksraad—has even gone so far as to admit the right of the ""Governments acting in this matter to use their influence with the parties concerned, in order to obtain, amicably, an enduring peace."" Now, the only Governments ""acting in this matter"" are those of England and of the Cape Colony; while the Transvaal State is itself one of the ""parties concerned,"" with whom those Governments are expressly invited to ""use their influence."" Thus, events and circumstances have been kinder to the Ministry almost than they deserved, and if they now neglect this golden opportunity—if Lord Derby fails to follow up his verbal protest with active steps for restoring English prestige and influence, not only in Bechuanaland, but in Zululand, and in every other part of the country where the peace has been broken by the Boers, the last state of those portions of the British dominions will be worse than the first, and the fault will lie wholly and solely at the door of the present Government.'}]","[{'document_title': 'THE INSTRUCTIONS TO SIR HERCULES ROBINSON', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'On January 10th a Parliamentary paper was issued containing the instructions addressed by the Earl of Kimberley to Sir Hercules Robinson, on his departure to assume the offices of Governor of the Cape and High Commissioner in South Africa. With regard to the Transvaal, Lord Kimberley says that Her Majesty’s Government have anxiously looked forward to the time when it might be possible to confer free institutions on the Transvaal, but ""the recent news of an attempt to overthrow the Queen’s sovereignty by armed force renders it useless to discuss arrangements which can only be practicable when the authority of the Crown has been vindicated, and the maintenance of tranquillity is firmly assured. When this has been effected Her Majesty’s Government will be prepared carefully to consider the best means of assuring to the Dutch settlers such full control of their local affairs as may be consistent with the general interests of Her Majesty’s dominions in South Africa, and with the obligations which have been incurred by this country to the very large native population in the Transvaal."" ""I will only further say,"" continues Lord Kimberley, ""that any plan of union or confederation which may hereafter be agreed upon by the three colonies will be considered by Her Majesty’s Government with an earnest desire to be able to give it their sanction. Failing any complete scheme of union, it might be possible to bring about at once joint action in regard to Customs\' duties, and such matters as postal and telegraphic communication, and, above all, to establish a well-considered and efficient system of mutual co-operation for the maintenance of peace and for defence against risings or attacks of natives, whether within or beyond the frontiers."" Upon the subject of the Basuto War, after expressing disapproval of the policy pursued by the Colonial Government, Lord Kimberley says: ""As there appears, unfortunately, to be no immediate prospect of the re-establishment of the authority of the Colonial Government, the question presents itself whether it would be possible by any friendly intervention on the part of Her Majesty’s Government to facilitate the restoration of peace. It is obvious that the conditions under which Her Majesty’s Government could attempt to bring about a settlement of the difficulty must depend upon various circumstances which cannot now be wholly foreseen. I am unable, therefore, to say more at present than that if the Colonial Government should desire that an effort should be made to bring about a settlement through the Imperial authority, and you should be satisfied that the Basutos would be willing to place themselves in the hands of Her Majesty’s Government, I should be ready to receive favourably any proposition for the appointment of a Commission to consider and recommend terms of settlement, or for the direct intervention of the Crown, if that should appear preferable.

Of all the complications and difficulties that threaten this portion of the Empire, perhaps the most serious are those connected with the Transvaal. While disclaiming any bellicose spirit, it would seem that nothing short of a renewal of hostilities between this country and the Boers will effect any satisfactory settlement of existing problems. It is rumoured that the Government intend concluding a new arrangement with the Transvaal Volksraad concerning the Bechuanas and Baralongs, by which the Boers will assume the protection and government of the native tribes to the north and north-east of them. This policy not only reflects upon our humanity, but upon the utter short-sightedness of the Government in commercial matters, for the result will practically be to close up to British and colonial traders the highway to the interior. As may be readily imagined, the sanction tacitly given by the British Government to the establishment of a Boer Protectorate over the Zulu nation, has led to any amount of ""tall"" talk and no little despotic acts on the part of our late foes. It would almost seem as though Mr. Gladstone\'s Government intended to relieve itself before long of all bother and responsibility connected with the Zulus, their country, and their affairs. It is scarcely necessary to add that many of the Boers have helped themselves pretty freely to large portions of the most fertile land in Zulu territory, and that, as a consequence, the value of farms has been considerably enhanced. Thanks to the firmness, promptitude, and forethought displayed by Sir John Brand in quelling the Baralong difficulty, no opportunity has been afforded the Basutos for a rising, and Colonel Clarke has been enabled to maintain order up to the present.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1884#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Affairs in Bechuanaland', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The situation may now be summed up as follows: ""The Volksraad of the Transvaal has ratified the Convention establishing the joint protectorate of Bechuanaland, but they demand their old Sand River boundary which has just been modified by the Convention.

The Transvaal calmly disregards Mr. Mackenzie\'s demand for the restoration of stolen cattle. Under these circumstances the only appeal left is to force. But where is the force to come from? Mr. Mackenzie has not a British soldier at his back. He must depend upon the colonial police. But the Cape Parliament in both Houses has just declared in favour of superseding Mr. Mackenzie\'s protectorate by colonial annexation. To crown all, Mankoroane himself is said to desire annexation. Annexation, therefore, becomes inevitable. But the experience of Basutoland does not justify much confidence in that solution.

But if there are difficulties ahead, it is well that the country should be prepared for them in good time. From the detailed accounts we have lately received of the defeat of Usibepu, the loyal Zulu chief, whose power had been established on the ruins of Cetewayo\'s, it appears that the position of the Reserve and of the British Resident is seriously threatened. The conquerors of Usibepu included not only the Usutus, the tribesmen who had been unshaken in their allegiance to Cetewayo, but a powerful body of Boers from the Transvaal. To the latter, it is said, was due the success of the attack on Usibepu\'s warriors, who, having repulsed the onslaught of their native enemies, were broken by the withering fire of the Dutch riflemen. The flight of Usibepu leaves the ground clear for the ambition of the Boer leaders, and brings the Usutus, intoxicated by victory, face to face with the British forces within the Reserve. It is evident that the former adherents of Cetewayo are, for the moment, merely tools of the adventurers from the Transvaal, who imagine that there is something to be gained by stirring up turmoil among the Zulus. The experiment is, perhaps, not as hopeful as its authors believe, for the Zulus, as South African history shows, are not tools that can always be handled with safety and success by the Boers. In order, however, to rid themselves of Usibepu, and to give a check to the British power, the Usutus are willing to become the close allies of the Transvaal Republic, or, at all events, of its more reckless and aggressive spirits. Dinizulu, the youthful son of Cetewayo, has been set up as a puppet sovereign by the Boers, who have promised him their protection and assistance, and to revive a forgotten treaty of offensive and defensive alliance with Cetewayo\'s father, Panda. The first-fruits of this confederacy are visible in the overthrow of Usibepu. The latter reckoned, apparently, upon English support, though without any well-defined claim, and the Boers will in all probability make use of his ""abandonment"" as a cogent argument addressed to the native mind in favour of the Dutch instead of the British connexion. The Boers, at the same time, if not possessed of much political knowledge, can hardly be ignorant of the serious aspects of an attack upon England, and having enough to occupy them immediately in the absorption of the territories of Usibepu and his adherents, they will hardly encourage their new allies to press their advantage so far as to threaten the Reserve. But the Usutus are savages, and, while ready enough to accept the assistance of the Boers in battle, they may not be equally willing to pay deference to the prudent counsels of their advisers. They have already declared, in menacing language, that they will not spare either the Reserve or Natal itself in their campaign of vengeance. Mr. Osborn, the British Resident, had been forced to retreat even before the recent victory of the Boers and Usutus over Usibepu, and has been standing for some time on the defensive. The Imperial forces in Natal and in the Reserve are, no doubt, strong enough to repel any partial and unorganized raid, but there is now, it is clear, a possibility, at least, of more serious perils, which is causing disquietude at Maritzburg and Durban.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1884#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT.—HOUSE OF COMMONS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In answer to Mr. Miller,\n\nMr. Adderley said that the Government had not extended British protection over the Basuto Territory, but they had authorized the Governor of the Cape, as High Commissioner, to negotiate with the Colony of Natal for the annexation of that territory to Natal, upon the conditions that Natal would be willing to undertake the government of that extended territory, and the Basuto tribes were willing to submit to the taxation which would enable the Natal Government to govern them without any further charge upon their own revenues.

Cetewayo was restored at the beginning of last year, and there ensued at once a condition of misery and strife which verified only too faithfully Mr. Gladstone\'s prophecy of the ""extensive shedding of blood."" The Zulu King, so far from being welcomed, was expelled from his dominions by his former subjects, and died a few months ago, a refugee under the protection of British troops. Under such circumstances no one can deny that Mr. Gladstone was right in holding that we became saddled with ""a serious addition to the responsibility we had already incurred."" Melancholy and discreditable though the story be, it is necessary that we should consider our responsibility, and to what extent our Government has attempted to make ""the peace and welfare of the Zulu country the dominant consideration.""\n\nLess than six years ago the Zulus were a prosperous people, in possession of a fertile country, and occupying a position of pre-eminence among the native races of South Africa. In the interests principally of the Transvaal Boers, who had most to fear from Cetewayo, we invaded the Zulu country, overthrew the native government, and broke up the national organization. From that moment, as Mr. Gladstone has admitted, our responsibility towards the Zulus was created. In the words of Mr. Fynn, the British Resident with Cetewayo, ""from a native point of view, the Zulus thereby became the adopted children of the English."" They looked to us for a government, and were ready to pay us taxes. We did give them a government, but it was one divided among thirteen chieftains, and it lacked one absolute essential—a supreme central authority. The British Resident, whom the natives expected to possess such authority, was soon discovered by them to be a mere puppet. For that reason, and owing to external agitation, the first government we gave the Zulus broke down. In recognition of our duty to find them a better one, we restored Cetewayo to represent the paramount authority which had been hitherto wanting—in defiance, it must be said, of the most solemn promises made to the chiefs who were superseded. This was followed by a period of bloodshed, misery, and anarchy far more calamitous than anything before; but the sudden and timely death of Cetewayo gave the British authorities a golden opportunity for securing ""the peace and welfare of the country.""', 'last_edit_date': '1884-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1884#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Affairs in Bechuanaland', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In view of the crisis that has been reached in the affairs of Bechuanaland, it may prove interesting to review the present position and some of the circumstances that led up to it.

But, bad as the news undoubtedly is, it is not so bad as it at first appeared. Bechuanaland has been virtually snatched out of the hands of the Imperial Government, but it is not to be allowed to pass into those of the Boers. There has been a sudden volte face on the part of the Cape politicians, and a corresponding outbreak of lawlessness on the part of the filibusters. The Cape Colonists have changed their minds, and the change has revolutionised the situation. Twelve months ago they scouted the very idea of annexing Bechuanaland; now they unanimously pass resolutions in both Houses of Parliament in favour of that step. There has thus been a displacement of the centre of gravity in South African politics, and everything has been upset. Pending the re-establishment of equilibrium, it may not be without interest to sketch rapidly the course of Mr. Mackenzie\'s mission, which, although it has failed in its immediate object, has succeeded in its chief object. The great northern trade route from the Cape to Central Africa will not be allowed to fall into the hands of the Boers. That at least is safe. For the attainment of his wider schemes of a comprehensive impartial Imperial native administration he can afford to wait. Time will teach its lesson in Bechuanaland as in Basutoland, and the\n**129**\n\ngoal will yet be attained. Nor is it Mr. Mackenzie\'s fault that the dolorous path will be marked by blood and fire."" Mr. Mackenzie, it may be remembered, left this country in April last. He arrived in South Africa in May, met with a very encouraging reception, and for a time all went well. At the first public meeting convened about the middle of May, opposition was manifested by one or two leading residents to the new Commissioner\'s authority. Later, this opposition took the form of a determination to be annexed by the Cape Colony, rather than be governed by an Imperial Resident. After some delay the question came on for discussion in the Cape Parliament, and on July 17 a resolution was passed unanimously authorizing the annexation of the territory.

They talk as though their trade were secure as far as Lake Ngami, and as though it will be pushed right up to the Zambesi and brought to include the Matabele country ""known"" to be rich in gold. It looks much as if all Africa to the south of 18 deg. S. latitude would soon be brought under English influence and opened to English trade. The question remains as to the means and the cost. There are those who would at once subsidize the great chiefs on condition that they keep the trade route open, protect traders, and allow no other European Power to become paramount. Undoubtedly we have here a great field for the expansion of English philanthropy and English commerce, but it remains to be seen how far the taxpayer is willing to contribute to secure this field. He is generous in his philanthropy, but shrewd in business transactions. The base of operations is the European settlements of the Cape Colony, the Free State, and the Transvaal Republic. And there are two main factors in the case. On the one hand there is the control, shared between the Imperial and the local Governments; on the other there is the local force, divided into the two elements, English and Dutch. These four powers are always at work. The Imperial Government endeavours to arrest a too rapid and extravagant progress, but the Colonial Government is always ahead of this wise caution, and this is chiefly due to the fact that the local Governments have no ultimate responsibility. Colonial energy is always outrunning colonial strength. The English element pushes on fearlessly, relying on English organization and administration to create order in its rear. The Dutch element proceeds on purely ""individualistic"" lines. Each Boer adventurer is quite content and determined to deal with the natives entirely ""off his own bat,"" and he hotly resents any superior control of his actions. The consequence is that both elements are vigorously expansive; both hard at work extending white influence among the neighbouring native tribes.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1885#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Position and the Hopes of South Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Dr. Jameson said he should not weary them with the history of the Matabele trouble, or with the more recent history of the developments in Mashunaland. He would attempt to give a short sketch of South Africa generally under three divisions—the past, the present, and what, according to his idea, the future would be. He also hoped to give some sketch of Rhodesia, with which he was intimately connected, as the central factor in producing what was his idea of the future. He must say that during his two months' stay here he had found colonial history and colonial geography were not the strongest points among his friends in this country. More than 300 years ago, some of the best families in France and Holland, compelled to emigrate, settled down on that narrow strip of ground between Table Mountain and the sea. About the year 1700, the first Dutch governor landed at the Cape and assumed administration there. About fifty years later three English men-of-war were sent, and Cape Colony was attached to the English Crown. By that time the Colony had extended 200 miles inland, and during the next twenty-five years it extended 400 miles. About that time there occurred the abolition of slavery, and he thought their Dutch friends were treated shabbily by the home Government in that matter. Then there arose the trek spirit of the Dutch, a spirit of adventure, the real essence of which was a determination to get away from English rule. That spirit had remained to the present day. When trouble arose between the Boers and the Zulus England stepped in and annexed Zululand, and when other troubles occurred England stepped in and made further annexations. After gaining practically the whole country, England reverted substantially to the position of administering only the Cape Colony and Natal. At length they came to the year 1880, when a Little England policy was in full force. The north was open to us, and it was open to the Transvaal, and we might thank our good fortune that we had at that time a man in South Africa of Imperial ideas and with the means of carrying those ideas out. Bechuanaland, the seat of Livingstone's first work, was within an ace of falling to the Transvaal, but through the energetic action of Sir Hercules Robinson and Mr. Rhodes it was saved to the Imperial Crown, and Bechuanaland became a Crown colony. Up to that time the Little England policy had been in force, but he did not think that any minister would have ventured to put forward, as a responsible proposition, the annexation under the British flag of the vast area known as Rhodesia. There was only one man who even thought of adding another thousand miles up to the end of Lake Tanganyika. For such an annexation the money had to be found, and where was it to be found. Mr. Rhodes found the money, and the Imperial Government would never have granted that charter without guarantee that it would be not only a flag annexation, but a bona-fide occupation and development. Mr. Rhodes found the money, and the other guarantors were well satisfied by his acceptance of a position on their present board of directors. That brought him up to the present time. In connection with the second division of his subject he wished to give a sketch of Rhodesia as it was, for Rhodesia would not only be, but was, a great, if not the greatest factor in producing the future of South Africa, which he interpreted as at all events a commercial union, amalgamation, or federation of all the South African states. They had in Rhodesia a country nearly as large as Europe, where white men and women could live. Mr. Rhodes had told them that it was a highly mineralised country. He could tell them that they had a highly payable country, and his opinion was based on many years' residence and communications with probably the best expert. Their gold fields were innumerable, and some of them had already proved payable. That would naturally attract a large population; but what he was anxious to prove was that there would be a permanent population, and that it would be a permanent home for the overflow population of England. It had been proved that they had iron universally distributed throughout the country. South of the Zambesi they had several coal beds spread over a large area. Therefore, they had one of the greatest factors of England's wealth—the coexistence of coal and iron side by side. As to the pastoral capabilities of the country, many Cape farmers were now in Rhodesia, and their opinion was that, agriculturally considered, the country was an eminent success. There was no indigenous disease with cattle, and no one who had been in Mashunaland and seen the vast herds of cattle in that country could doubt its great capabilities. They had erected 1,300 miles of telegraph, and 300 more were being arranged. They had built and established four brick townships, with all the necessary Government offices, with over 100 white civil list officers, exclusive of their 250 white police, a force which was being increased in view of their extending up to the southern end of Lake Tanganyika. When he left Buluwayo last August they had only been in occupation nine months, but Buluwayo had a population of 1,900 whites. Outside the town the Natives were employed in the peaceful occupation of making bricks, and there were in the gold fields some 2,000 prospectors at work, exclusive of those engaged in Mashunaland. The peaceable settlement of the country was not a paper settlement but one that had satisfied the Matabele nation. He was speaking from personal knowledge. Between November and August last, either at Buluwayo or outside in their various kraals, he had interviewed every headman in Matabeleland. They were thankful that the past régime was over, and glad of the protection and the civilised government under which they were now living. There were a thousand miles of roads in Rhodesia, and the transport service was becoming regular and excellent. They were really in a better position than Johannesburg was in the early days of its career. Railway extension was proceeding, and in three years he believed there would be complete railway communication from Cape Town to Buluwayo. Their revenue was practically balancing their expenditure. He would ask them to remember the dual position of the Chartered Company, first as a Government, and secondly as a commercial company. The directors had rightly determined that whenever Government revenue was produced by taxation it should be spent for the benefit of the country and the people who had contributed it. Their development would never be retarded again from want of funds. They had got over their external as well as their internal troubles. Formerly they had difficulties on the East with the Portuguese; but these were things of the past. They were now on the most amicable terms, and both desired to help each other in the development of their respective spheres. On the South the Transvaal had recognised the Limpopo as their northern boundary, and they had nothing further to fear from them. On the West and South-West they had the Protectorate, and the Protectorate they certainly thought their natural heritage according to their original charter. He had no doubt that her Majesty's Government, in good time, would hand over to them the local administration of the Protectorate when they thought the Company were capable of undertaking it. In looking forward to the commercial union of the South African States, he would use the word commercial in its widest sense. Outside commercial union there was the question of the flag, but that was too delicate a one for him to touch upon, and might well be left to settle itself in the future. After all, the flag question was more a question of sentiment, but certainly a sentiment which they in Charterland and in the Cape Colony were determined never to lose. But for the very reason that they thought so strongly on that point they could afford to appreciate and allow for the same feeling in others, and they must remember that unity of flag was not the sine qua non for the commercial union of which he was speaking. An important factor was the natural connexion between Rhodesia and the Cape Colony, for the very inception of Rhodesia was due to the Prime Minister of Cape Colony. Take a combination of Cape Colony, including the Free State, and Rhodesia determined upon this union. They had only left Natal, a British colony, and the Transvaal, and in the Transvaal there were about 50,000 Englishmen and colonists, who were far-seeing men, and who naturally must be one with them, as against only 15,000 Boers opposed to them. Surely they might hope that the Transvaal would see reason for joining in this much-to-be-desired union of the South African States. He thought that his interpretation of the future of South Africa was no dream, but was a fair proposition in practical politics, and must inevitably come about. If this desired end was reached what incalculable benefits it would bring.\n**[FEB. 6, 1895.]**"", 'last_edit_date': '1895-02-06', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/06_02_1895#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.634, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Amatongaland and its People', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The lecturer observed that the country which formed the subject of his paper had of late years been so little frequented by white men that its very name, Mapootaland, seemed to have been lost sight of. As a matter of fact, there was no such country as Amatongaland, and no such people as the Amatonga. Proceeding to speak of the commercial importance of the country, he classed the subject under three heads—railway, port, and canals. At the time that the Transvaal was British territory, a railway was in contemplation from Pretoria to Lourenco Marques. The Swazi King, as an ally of England, was willing that an English railway should pass through his territory. The railway, being no longer necessary after Majuba, fell through. The idea, however, was revived in 1883 by the Boers. He was in Lourenco Marques in 1883, when Major Machado, of the Portuguese Royal Engineers, arrived to survey the railway agreed upon between the Boers and Portuguese from Delagoa Bay to Pretoria. The concession for the Transvaal portion of this line, about 250 miles, was given to a Dutch syndicate. That had now become a German syndicate. The Portuguese portion of the line, about fifty-four miles, was all but completed, and that was in the hands of an Anglo-American-Portuguese Company. It was probable that either the Anglo-American-Portuguese Company would buy out the German-Dutch syndicate, and work the whole line from Lourenco Marques to Pretoria, or vice versa. If the latter, English trade would not be favoured, and it behoved Englishmen to take time by the forelock, and to look about for the means of discounting such a result. The main object of his paper was to suggest a method of doing so. Passing to the question of a port, he stated that Lourenco Marques, though a good port when once entered, was not easily accessible. To return to Amatongaland, however, at the Kosi mouth were the makings of an excellent port. The tortuous channel leading to Lourenco Marques and 100 miles in distance from England were saved, and eight miles of wharfage would be available. A sum of £5,000,000 had been mentioned, at which a commercial port at Delagoa Bay would be cheap. A mere fraction of that amount would, he said, create at Kosi a far superior port to that which now existed at Lourenco Marques. Having mentioned some of the transit duties charged at Delagoa Bay by the Portuguese Customhouse on English goods, he drew attention to the subject of canals. By creating a cheap method of transport these canals would encourage agriculture, and the natural products of Amatongaland would become paying industries. After calling attention to the mineral resources of the country, he said it must be palpable that, as the Transvaal abutted on Amatongaland, which was the only bit of independent native territory possessing a seaboard, the latter would either be used to carry out President Krüger's dog-in-the-manger policy of isolation for the Englishman, or the latter would push his trade without restriction through Amatongaland and Swaziland, the moneyed centres of the Transvaal. Again, as the Amatonga Queen retained complete jurisdiction over Inyak Island, which formed the magnificent naval port of Delagoa Bay—i.e., Port Melville—the political importance of Amatongaland to Great Britain could scarcely be overrated."", 'last_edit_date': '1888-02-17', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1888#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE TRANSVAAL', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the third meeting of the Royal Geographical Society during the present session, a paper was read by Mr. J.

After giving a brief account of the late government of the Dutch farmers in the Transvaal, Mr. Fynney showed the absolute necessity of the interference of the British Government, and the annexation of the territory, which he reports as having an area of 120,000 square miles. ""It lies between 22 deg. and 28 deg. S. latitude, 25 deg. and 32 deg. E. longitude, with a population estimated at 290,000 souls—namely, 40,000 whites and 250,000 natives. The two circumstances of the elevation and the position in latitude so blend together as to form a happy mingling of the tropical and temperate climates. The Transvaal is divided by nature into three divisions—viz., the high, middle, and low veldt. The high veldt might be said to begin at the Vaal river, and to embrace all the territory between that river and the first Magalisberg range, extending over 35,000 square miles, having a fine bracing climate. Coal, iron, and other minerals are found here. The middle veldt contains about 25,000 square miles, and consists of the spurs and slopes of the different mountain ranges, including part of the rich district of Marico, and \'the garden of the Transvaal,\' namely, the Rustenburg district. The last great natural division—the low veldt, or bush country, the largest of all the three—was upwards of 60,000 square miles in extent, having an elevation of from 2,000 to 4,000 feet above sea-level, and lying principally in the northern parts of the Transvaal. Consequently its tropical situation in latitude and its lower elevation combine to render its climate much hotter than that of the other two divisions. Still, the elasticity of the atmosphere, together with its dryness, make it pleasant and healthy in the higher parts. The three broad districts which have been thus described are divided, for purposes of economy and government, into counties, which are thirteen in number—viz., Potchefstroom, Bloemhof, Marico, Rustenburg, Waterberg, Zoutpansburg, Pretoria, Middleburg, Leydenburg, Leydenburg Gold Fields, Heidelberg, Wakkerstroom, Utrecht.

The first was the political evolution of the country and the diplomatic interaction between Madagascar and foreign powers, particularly Britain and France. Second, major changes took place in the social organization of the country, par› ticularly in the religious, administrative and economic fields. Political evolution consisted mainly of the consolidation of the Merina monarchy and the expansion of its authority to the rest of the island. The diplomatic relations that this monarchy maintained with both Britain and France became a cornerstone of the country's development. The changes that were effected in administration, particularly in the establishment of law and order, facilitated economic development. This was also a major factor in Madagascar's efforts to modernize itself and to resist foreign domination. The embracing of foreign religions was viewed as part of this process of modernization.\nA brief description of the country and its people may be necessary here. There are some eighteen ethnic groups in Madagascar of which the largest and, as it turned out, the most important in the nineteenth century, are the Merina who live on the central plateau of the island. This central plateau, known as Imerina (the country which one sees from afar), was the home of the Merina among whom there was a privileged class who came to rule the greater part of the island before it was colonized by the French. It is difficult to say what the population of Madagascar was during the period under review, but the British consul in Madagascar estimated it to be 5 million in 1865, of whom about 800 000 were Merina.$^{1}$ All the Malagasy groups speak the same language and have, with few exceptions, similar customs and religious traditions.

The attitude of Ranavalona was, therefore, not one of systematic rejection, though she was from the start obviously less enthusiastic about Christianity than her predecessor. What worried the new leaders most and eventually drove them into a struggle against the growing influence of Christianity was that it constituted a challenge to Malagasy traditions and institutions generally, and the monarchy in par› ticular. Christian rituals competed with the ceremonies of the royal religion. By discouraging the worship of sampimoanja-Kana (sampy), the royal divinity guaranteeing the well-being of the state, Christianity shook the foundations of royal power. Its egalitarian principles were also in conflict with the traditional hierarchy of castes.$^{25}$ Christianity was changing the traditions of the country and turning the Malagasy into worshippers of Jesus Christ whom they regarded as the whitemen's ancestor. By 1830 there were about 200 converted Christians who were even prepared to die for their faith; the government could not remain indifferent to this 'new power which had arisen in the land'.$^{26}$ When the missionaries refused to offer education without being allowed to preach their religion, the breach with Ranavalona was unavoidable. Her first response was to forbid baptism in 1832. Three years later all her subjects were prohibited from becoming or remaining Christians. The preaching of Christianity was banned, but the ban did not apply to secular education. Explaining the reasons for her decision, Ranavalona told the British missionaries, whom she summoned to her palace on 26 February 1835, that: While she thanked them for the good services they had rendered to the country, and while they were at liberty to follow their own religious customs, she would not permit her subjects to depart from their old customs ... She gave full permission for the teaching of the arts or sciences but not religion. 27 The first martyrs fell; Rasalama in August 1837 and Raqarilahy-Andriamazok in February 1838.

For instance, the Vakinisisaony, the ancestral land of the Imerina kings and the initial region of adoption of sampy such as Ikelimalaza, held the privilege of conferring legitimacy on the sovereign. However, throughout the nineteenth century, the inhabitants of the Vakinisisaony, who had a reputation for toughness, suffered under the burden of forced labour and felt the full weight of-the power of the Avaradrano, the people who had supported Andrianampoinimerina. Many of the Andriana, or nobles, of the Vakinisisaony were eliminated, as in the case of the guardians of Ikelimalaza, which was first confiscated by Andrianampoinimerina and then burnt down in 1869.

In the northern part of the toko, groups that continued to respect the traditional religion, and Christians existed side by side.

Political, economic and religious affairs were all intertwined. The supporters of the Eglise du Palais (the Palace Church) not only handled the affairs of state, such as censuses, education and recruitment for the army and forced labour, but also took advantage of their positions and the economic system to enrich themselves through trade and moneylending. Guardians of sampy and local dignitaries who had been deprived of their traditional powers and privileges opposed the island's leaders by taking flight or by refusing to build churches or setting fire to them. '$^{3}$ Moreover, the Christianized Merina were by no means unanimous in their support for the official Church. Those who were not integrated into the Church and who practised a sort of popular Christianity drawing its inspiration from the Bible and from local history and folklore, formed an educated elite which could lay claim to p jiitical leadership.\nThey engaged in trade and made a practice of preaching their ideas on market days.

The Catholics were very active in the Betsileo country and among the subject peoples, who developed a kind of people's Christianity alongside the official religion. Furthermore, in reaction to authority, there was a revival of traditional religions, despite the public destruction of sampy that accompanied the spread of Christianity.

Through men such as James Cameron, the LMS had given a great deal of technical assistance to the Malagasy, and Rainilaiarivony and his colleagues believed that by embracing the LMS's brand of Christianity they would further cement this friendship. In fact, by embracing Protestantism they would draw closer to Britain as allies who could be expected to take their side should difficulties occur again with the French.

On the contrary, he started out by attempting, as the Minister had instructed him to do, to combat the Merina hegemony and to embark on the 'politique des races' which had earlier been tried out in the Soudan (French West Africa) and Indochina. Former sovereigns or their sons were accordingly brought into the administration as 'native governors', while 'internal protectorates' were created among the extensive kingdoms in the west and south-west. This system did not prove satis› factory, however, and from 1905 onwards the number of Merina assistants was increased to a disproportionate degree, since the Merina were regarded as being more suitable material for 'progress and adaptation' than the other peoples. Finally, GalliØni introduced French settlers (colons) and Asian immigrant workers into the new colony which greatly alienated the indigenous people.

The finishing touches were put to the territorial unification of Madagascar with three measures.

The uprising he organized was the only Menalamba movement in which commercial considerations played a fundamental part: the aim was to take control of regional trade, of which the Indians and Creoles had a virtual monopoly, which is why they were attacked. In the nearby regions of the Imerina, the relations of the Menalamba leaders maintained with local kings and dignitaries were instrumental in the spread of some of their ideas. The Tanala Rainimangoro, for instance, declared that he had received orders from Antananarivo to drive out the French. 19 Elsewhere, such relations were non-existent.

Until October 1895, when the governor-general of the province, Rainandriamampandry, was recalled to Antananarivo, members of the Betsimisaraka tended to destroy the soldiers' rice fields, refused to feed the royal army, or else merely deserted. From December of the same year, they openly attacked military posts and took the initiative of mounting sorties or organized raids against Merina planta› tions.

In particular, the British wanted to secure the support of the ruler for the abolition of the slave trade, since Madagascar was one of the main sources of slaves in the region. It was Sir Robert's desire, therefore, to pursue an active political role in Madagascar. This policy, coinciding as it did with Radama's own determination to expand to the east, was to have, as one writer has put it, 'important consequences for the future of Madagascar'. 12 After several friendly contacts, Farquhar sent a diplomatic mission, led by Captain Le Sage, which arrived in Antananarivo on 21 December 1816. A treaty of friendship and commerce was eventually signed on 4 February 1817 between Radama and Le Sage. But this treaty did not satisfy the Mauritian Governor because it did not mention the slave trade, a matter of considerable importance to Sir Robert.

The negotiations, however, stumbled over the British insistence that Radama should outlaw the slave trade in Madagascar. When Radama argued that by doing this he would be com› mitting economic suicide because the slave trade was the major source of his revenue, Hastie had a ready answer: the British would pay the Malagasy ruler an annual sum of 1000 dollars in gold, 1000 dollars in silver, a hundred barrels of gunpowder, 100 English muskets with 100 flints, 400 soldiers' uniforms, 12 sergeants' swords, 600 pieces of cloth, a full-dress uniform for himself and 2 horses as compensation.$^{14}$ Radama considered that he had made a fair deal, especially since the treaty also recognized him as king of the whole of Madagascar.

Their Majesties then resumed their seats, and the high officers continued to present their hasina. I proceeded to develop my picture, which turned out very well, so far as the chief objects were concerned. These, and part of the city, which formed the background, came out well. The constant moving of the multitude in front made the nearer objects confused, but this may be corrected and made complete by filling in the figures in the foreground from a second which I took.'}, {'id': 90, 'article_title': 'Madagascar', 'full_section_title': 'Madagascar', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1863#article-20', 'issue_date': '23_01_1863', 'content': '""When their Majesties retired, the scene became more crowded than before. I saluted the King as he passed near my tent on his return, and was surprised at the quietness of his horse among the floating of banners, sounds of music, shouting of multitudes, and report of cannon; to say nothing of the shouting, and running to seek palanquins or bearers, as the vast multitudes, like a surging torrent, approached the place of exit from the ground to the road leading back to the palace.\n\n""And now the scene—which, favoured by the nature of the country, a cloudless sky, and tropical sun, together with the joyous occasion which had produced it, made it one of the most imposing I had ever witnessed—began to change. The lower line of the granite mountain on which the city stands—and which, 200 feet above the plain, stretched from north to south behind the platform, at a distance of 200 or 300 yards—had been thronged with spectators. Greater numbers still had spread themselves over the sides and summits of the hills to the north and the west; while numbers were seen in beautiful perspective extending from the base to the very summit of Ambohi Zanahary (village of God), a massive circular hill to the south-west. This throng of spectators, clothed in the long flowing lambas, of pure white, or deep rich glowing colours, and who, except when clapping their hands or shouting for joy, had been quiet gazers on the scene, were now seen moving in various directions until they were absorbed in the multitudes that crowded the roads leading from the plain.\n\n""I had noticed as the King approached that the members of his family, especially those connected with the first Radama and his father, turned their faces towards him and clapped their hands, and sang some of the native songs, as was the custom in ancient times.\n\n""I now packed up my camera, took down my tent, and made the best of my way home. The heat had been intense, especially in the small tent, and I was glad of some refreshment, having been on the ground from seven until nearly three.

The new Queen is sister, or rather first cousin, to the late Queen, it being customary among the Malagasy to call cousins brothers and sisters.\n\nThe late Queen was laid in state for twelve days, and almost everybody went to see her. In the largest room on the ground floor of the palace was a hearse, covered with scarlet and gilt, in which the corpse was supposed to be, but I am informed it was not really there. The room was full of women, who were wailing; some were kneeling, with their faces buried in their hands, and bowed to the ground; those nearest the corpse had fans of scarlet cloth, beautifully embroidered with gold, to keep away the flies. Directly the Queen\'s death was made known, all the people, with the exception of about twenty of the highest officers, had to cut off their hair and put off all their clothing except the ""lamba,"" and this only to wear from the waist to the knees, until after the funeral, when the shoulders, too, were to be covered by the ""lamba,"" but nothing else worn. No singing is allowed whilst mourning for a sovereign; no clay walls nor houses are to be built; no earthenware made, and a great many more things are forbidden.\n\nThe Queen\'s coffin was made of silver dollars, and is valued at about 4,500£. The tomb is built like that of Radama I., only the little house on the top is painted scarlet, with gilt posts and eagles. There is a bar of silver across the door, and the inscription over it is laid in in solid gold. All the Europeans, and some of the ladies, were present at the funeral. The body was carried in the scarlet and gilt hearse, on which were arranged very tastefully her coronation robes. The Prime Minister, the Chief Secretary of State, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer were chief mourners. Before the body was laid in the tomb forty officers brought a great quantity of the late Queen\'s private property to be put into the tomb—easy chairs, dressing and other tables, chests of drawers, tea services, decanters, wine and liqueur glasses, lamps, a clock, dresses, lambas, and a host of other things; last, though not least, a large box full of dollars.', 'last_edit_date': '1868-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1868#article-32', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE REVOLUTION IN MADAGASCAR', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""In the course of the forenoon four of the chief nobles went to the Queen with a written paper, which they handed to her, as expressing the terms or conditions on which for the future the country should be governed.

The Queen, after reading the document, and listening to it and receiving explanations on one or two points, expressed her full and entire consent to govern according to the plan therein set forth. The nobles then said, \'We also bind ourselves by this agreement.

Those who know anything of Madagascar history know the unpronounceable name of Andrianampoinimerina, who held sway from 1787-1810, and who brought much of the island to be subject to the Hova tribe. He had a favourite sister, Rahety by name, and it was at one time thought that her descendants might ultimately obtain the crown; but she gave birth to twins, and had no other issue. For fear, then, that the descendants of these two children should dispute as to their rights to the crown they were both put aside. In course of time one of these lines became extinct. As the late Queen lay on her death bed, very early in the morning of her death, a young girl of about twenty years was awakened out of her sleep in a house about a mile from the palace and taken at once into the presence of the dying Queen, who there and then named her as her successor, and exhorted her in some parting words to trust in the same God as she had trusted in. This young girl, Rajáfindrahety by name, was great-grand-daughter of the Rahety above spoken of. She was well educated in the schools of the Quakers in this city, and latterly in that of the London Missionary Society, and was, I am told, most promising and intelligent. There is another curious thing connected with it. Some three or four years ago she was married to a nephew of the late Queen. Little over two months ago, on May 7, her husband died. If this had not taken place it may be safely said that the girl would never have been Queen. The present Prime Minister would never have suffered any one to be Queen to whom he could not have had access, whether by night or day, and there is no doubt that very soon, even if it has not, as some say, already taken place, he will become the husband of the present Queen, and, unless prevented by the French, become far more powerful than he has ever yet been. Indeed, this is even now evident. For the first time in the history of Madagascar there has been not only no bloodshed, but not even commotion of any kind. The new Queen, under the title of Ranavalona III., has been accepted by the nation as their Sovereign. There is, indeed, no doubt but that some would have preferred a King but as long as the present Prime Minister has power there is no chance of this. He is not of the royal family, and could never become King; this he well knows, and is content with his present position and power.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1883#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MADAGASCAR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Madagascar has become doubly interesting to us since the establishment of what may be called ""constitutional checks"" on the power of the Sovereign. The present Queen accepted these as the condition of her accession. The paragraph which we published last month from the French papers was one calculated to cause some inquietude, except that, as our friends of the London Missionary Society justly observe, ""Every communication since the death of the late King, coming through the French medium, has proved to be either greatly exaggerated or wholly unfounded. That a revolution so recent, so sudden, and involving the assassination of Radama, who had been greatly beloved by large classes of the people, should be followed by temporary disorder and acts of hostility on the part of outlying tribes, was naturally to be expected. Such events, we have every reason to believe, have actually occurred. The Sakalavas, for instance, have always been forward to assert their independence, and at least a part of that tribe appears to have seized the opportunity to make inroads and commit acts of plunder upon the property of the Hovas.""\n\nIn the last letter received from the Rev. Mr. Ellis (the only dependable authority), dated July 2, these acts of hostility are alluded to, and it would seem that the danger had passed away, and that representatives from the different native tribes were then in the capital, professing their allegiance to the Queen."" The following, on the above subject, and on the general character and proceedings of the Government, are from Mr. Ellis\'s letter:—\n\n""A number of representatives from the Betsileo, the Sakalavas, and the Betsimisaraka, have come and are still coming to take the oath of allegiance to the new sovereign. They have all been most generously treated, admitted to the presence of the Queen, surrounded by all her officers, addressed kindly and encouragingly, as well as gratified by presents of cattle, &c., and are to-morrow to be entertained at a royal banquet at the palace. The affairs of the kingdom constitute now the business of the Government, in which Christians and Hovas are combined, promptitude and activity are everywhere apparent, and all parties are more careful in their public conduct. This state of things is not unfavourable to the Christians. The hereditary policy of the Hovas is \'Things as they have been;\' \'The wisdom of our ancestors cannot be surpassed.\' But so many innovations have turned out improvements and benefits, that the aim now seems to be to adopt what is good in the new, while retaining what they can of the old. All parties are deeply sensible of the advantages depending on the continuance of their friendship with England and France, which it is most ardently to be desired nothing may disturb.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-10-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1863#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MADAGASCAR', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'King Radama II. has been crowned at his capital of Antananarivo.

Circumstances have unfortunately prevented our doing so. The French papers say that mass was performed over the crown, before the latter was used for the coronation. If this be true, our impression is that it must have been done clandestinely. There is no tendency toward the religion of Rome in Madagascar; and the King is known to incline toward the Protestant faith.\n\nThe following appeared on Sunday, the 14th inst., in the _Moniteur_ (Paris), immediately after the announcement of the coronation:—\n\n""A treaty of commerce, on the largest basis, has been concluded between France and Madagascar. All other nations have obtained equally favourable terms.\n\n""The treaty makes no mention of territorial concessions—a subject which might have given rise to grave difficulties.""\n\nWe were very glad to see this, and hope and believe it was intended as an official contradiction of an article which appeared in the Paris paper, the _Opinion Nationale_, of the previous Thursday, as follows: ""King Radama II., King of the Hovas, has ceded to France the Bay of Diego Suarez, a magnificent anchorage, where the world\'s navies might ride quietly, while storms and typhoons rage in the ocean. The surrounding country, which is, of course, also ceded, is described as being clad with primeval forests of magnificent timber, and pouring forth plenteously the richest produce of the tropics.\n\n""At the instigation of England, in 1822, the King of the Hovas assumed the title of King of Madagascar, but France energetically protested against the usurpation of the right to reign over an island which belongs to her. In 1840, the Sclavo princes of the north, our old and faithful allies, driven to desperation by English attempts to oust them, came in a body, and offered to cede their territories to Admiral Tell, Governor of the Island of Reunion. This offer was accepted in 1841, and since then France has occupied the islands in the vicinity of Diego Suarez—viz., Mayotte, Noja Bé, and Nossi Comba; and the Bay of Diego Suarez therefore belonged to France already. Our claim is undoubted. We cannot understand why _La France_ should speak of the King\'s \'generosity\' in ceding to us what was already ours, nor that this cession will in any way vitiate our claims to the Island of Madagascar.""', 'last_edit_date': '1862-12-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1862#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.634, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Madagascar', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""So far as choice, variety, and abundance were concerned, it was a right royal banquet.

This was the weak point which laid Radama open to bad advisers; hence the cruelty and treachery of foreign intriguers, who took advantage of his weakness and excitement, which they themselves brought on, to accomplish purposes which he would not have entertained in his sane moments. It was under the influence of their wine that he signed the fatal treaty with a well-known foreigner, and other documents which he did not understand, and it was this evil which finally accelerated the loss of his reason and his life.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1863#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE REPORTED DEATH OF THE QUEEN OF MADAGASCAR', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Fresh telegrams have been received at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs from Madagascar to the effect that it has been ascertained that Queen Ranavalo has been dead for the last six months, and that, to further their own ends, the military party have kept the fact secret.

With the view, also, of shielding the perpetrators of the intended murders, the King announced his intention to issue an order, or law, that any person or persons wishing to fight with fire-arms, swords, or spears, should not be prevented, and that if any one were killed the murderer should not be punished. This alarmed the whole community. On the 7th inst. Radama repeated before his Ministers and others in the palace his determination to issue that order; and among all the Mena maso present only three opposed the issuing of the order; many were silent; the rest expressed their approval. The nobles and heads of the people spent the day in deliberating on the course they should pursue, and the next morning the Prime Minister, with about 100 of the nobles and heads of the people, including the Commander-in-Chief, the King\'s Treasurer, and the first officer of the palace, went to the King, and remonstrated against his legalising murder, and besought him most earnestly not to issue such order. It is said that the Prime Minister went on his knees before him, and begged him not to issue this obnoxious law; but he remained unmoved.

Subsequently a message was brought to him as from his ancestors, to the effect that, if he did not stop \'the praying,\' some great calamity would soon befall him.

431,"Governor Richard Pine's leadership in the Gold Coast was effective and necessary, as he utilized local experience to address corruption and maintain peace without bloodshed, ultimately aiming for future prosperity in the region.","The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present a nuanced view of Governor Richard Pine's leadership in the Gold Coast, challenging the claim of his effectiveness and necessity. The General History of Africa highlights significant opposition to Pine's administration, such as the resistance to a poll tax primarily used to pay civil servants rather than for public improvements, leading to its abandonment in 1864. This resistance, along with protests from local chiefs against encroachments on their rights and the deportation of Aggrey, the 'king' of Cape Coast, for opposing British policies, suggests that Pine's leadership faced substantial challenges and did not maintain peace without bloodshed. The textbook does not provide evidence of Pine utilizing local experience to address corruption or aiming for future prosperity. In contrast, The African Times offers a mixed perspective, acknowledging Pine's efforts to address the Kroboe Fine issue without bloodshed and his role in breaking up a group of corrupt officials, which supports aspects of the claim. However, the articles also criticize his administration as ineffective, citing contentious relationships with local chiefs and the military, unnecessary conflicts with the Ashantees, arbitrary exactions, and interference in various departments. Additionally, dissatisfaction with the Legislative Council's composition and mercantile influence suggests a lack of local engagement. Together, these sources depict a complex and contested legacy, with both supportive and critical elements regarding Pine's leadership.","The General History of Africa textbook provides some insights into Governor Richard Pine's leadership in the Gold Coast, but it does not fully support the claim of his effectiveness and necessity. The textbook mentions that Pine faced strong resistance to a poll tax he instituted, which was largely used to pay civil servants rather than for public improvements like schools and roads. This resistance led to the abandonment of the tax in 1864, indicating challenges in his administration. Furthermore, the chiefs on the Gold Coast protested against encroachments on their rights, and Aggrey, the 'king' of Cape Coast, was deported for his opposition to British policies. These details suggest that Pine's leadership faced significant opposition and challenges, contradicting the claim of maintaining peace without bloodshed and effectively addressing corruption. The textbook does not provide evidence of Pine utilizing local experience to address corruption or aiming for future prosperity, highlighting a difference between the claim and the historical account.","The African Times news articles provide a mixed perspective on Governor Richard Pine's leadership in the Gold Coast. On one hand, there are details that support the claim of his effective leadership, such as his ability to address the Kroboe Fine issue without bloodshed and his efforts to bring the Kroboe chiefs to reason, which aligns with the claim of maintaining peace and aiming for future prosperity. Additionally, Pine is credited with breaking up a group of corrupt officials, suggesting his role in addressing corruption. However, there are also significant criticisms of his administration. Some articles describe his leadership as ineffective, highlighting his contentious relationships with local chiefs and the military, and suggesting that his actions led to unnecessary conflict, particularly with the Ashantees. Furthermore, his administration is characterized by arbitrary exactions and interference in various departments, which contradicts the claim of utilizing local experience effectively. The articles also mention dissatisfaction with the composition of the Legislative Council and the influence of mercantile interests, which could imply a lack of local engagement. Overall, while there are elements that align with the claim, the articles also present substantial evidence of controversy and challenges during Pine's tenure, indicating a more complex and contested legacy.",True,431,African Leadership,Political Dynamics under African Leadership,"[{'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The best resume of his policy is found in a set of instructions he issued to his officers in 1906, in which he argues for 'a single Government in which the Native Chiefs have well-defined duties and an acknowledged status equally with the British officials'.$^{10}$ The basis of what was to become the system of indirect rule was therefore one of co-operation, not sub› ordination, with the British Resident acting primarily in an advisory, not an executive capacity, and with the African 'chief - in this instance, the Fulani emir - continuing in a traditional role which was now carefully guided, not rigidly fixed by the imposed colonial administration. In this attempt to integrate the emirs into the colonial system, Lugard wished to leave to them most of their old responsibilities, functions, and perquisites of office so that they would continue to appear in the eyes of the local populations as the legitimate rulers.\nIf, then, the essential of Lugard's rule was the use of existing authorities in existing capacities, something more was intended. Modifications along European lines were expected in matters such as justice and taxation. 11 'The great task of indirect rule,' wrote Lugard's biographer in an article defending his policy, 'is to hold the ring, to preserve a fair field within which Africans can strike their own balance between conservatism and adaptation.'$^{12}$ That task depended in large measure on the knowledge that European administrators had of local customs and institutions - and, of course, on the willingness of the native authorities to make such adjust› ments towards modernization within the context of their own institutions."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.564, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': ""In accordance with the general principle that local populations should defray the costs of measures calculated to enhance their material, social and intellectual progress, a poll tax of one shilling per head was instituted in 1852 and generally accepted, though only very briefly.$^{5}$ In fact, resistance to the tax soon became very strong, not so much because the officials responsible for tax collection were supplanting the chiefs, but because only 8 per cent of the revenue was used for schools and roads, most of it being used to pay the host of civil servants on administrative duties. Despite subsequent attempts at reform and punitive expeditions, Governor Pine was forced to abandon the tax in 1864.\nThis was the first resistance movement of a purely social and national, that is to say non-ethnic, character. It was very quickly followed, moreover, by an action$^{6}$ of much greater scope since it was political in nature. As early as 1864, the chiefs on the Gold Coast sent a register of grievances to Governor Pine to protest against encroachments on their rights and inter› ests, giving specific examples, such as imprisonment by mere civil servants, to show how their dignity had been flouted.$^{7}$ Shortly afterwards, Aggrey, the 'king' of Cape Coast, went even further. On the advice of a talented lawyer, Charles Bannerman, he protested against the fact that the inhabi- tants of his territory were treated as British subjects, demanded that the relationships between the chiefs and the governor be clarified and queried the fact that he received no share of the fiscal revenue.$^{8}$ Lastly, Aggrey threatened to raise a local militia to ensure the security of his territory.

Maclean, President of the Council of Merchants that provided the local administration of the forts, could therefore give free reign to his business acumen and knowledge of people, often disregarding official instructions from London, where a committee of merchants once again had charge of the forts. He had a twofold objective: to keep Asante at bay and to bring the coastal peoples under his control. He therefore had a tripartite FanteBritish-Asante treaty signed whereby the parties recognized the inde› pendence of the coastal countries south of the Pra river, agreed to bring any conflict before the British party and undertook to keep trade routes open. Maclean tried gradually to acquaint the Fante with English legal principles through a hierarchy of courts ranging from the chiefs' courts to those over which he himself presided. Local militias posted at the chiefs' courts helped to apply the new laws, whilst the introduction of cowries for minor transactions and the encouragement of the production of palm oil started to change the economic structure.\nHowever, the British government decided to resume direct control of the coastal settlements in 1843 and to govern them by a legal convention among the chiefs recognizing British law (the Bond of 1844).$^{4}$ In 1858 the administration of the Gold Coast, which, apart from the forts, was a protectorate rather than a colony, was separated from Sierra Leone.

The few exceptions included, notably, General (later Marshal) Lyautey in Morocco, Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard in Northern Nigeria and Sir Gordon Guggisberg in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators. There is among the whole of this badly payed and very wretched elite - as remote from indigenous society, from which it has been driven out, as it is from European society into which it is not admitted - a feeling of disillusionment, discontent and bitterness which it would prove dangerous to be unaware of. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.565, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The most important and most discussed African component was the local chief. Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.579, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'Politics and nationalism in British West Africa > Rural politics or rural mass nationalism in the inter-war period', 'content': ""In this document, fees and fines being imposed by the traditional rulers were reduced and regulations for their imposition were laid down; the Okwahuman Council was also to be made a truly representative body of chiefs and commoners and failure to attend was to be made punishable by fine.

Trade in foodstuffs was to be centralized in certain towns, a detailed list of market prices and trade fees was to be drawn up, the export of fish and game from Kwahu was prohibited and rules governing marriages, family responsibilities in debt cases, funerals, adultery by chiefs, etc., were laid down. As J. Simensen has concluded, 'this Charter is probably the most detailed documentation that we have from the early period of colonial rule in the Gold Coast of an attempt by commoners to curtail the authority of the traditional elite and assert their own influence more effectively in the fields of jurisdiction and legislation.' 19 The second method adopted by the commoners of the rural areas was the destoolment (deposition) of their traditional rulers, and this became quite a common feature of rural politics in the Gold Coast in the inter-war period. Between 1910 and 1944, there were at least thirty-three depositions of divisional chiefs in Akyem Abuakwa alone.

As the seat of the colonial government and the naval Vice-Admiralty, the victualling base for the naval patrol, and the official liberation centre for the Mixed Commissions, Freetown and the interior could count on a more or less regular injection of subsidies. MacCarthy improved the early villages and built new ones, where new arrivals were adopted and settled down among brothers. Vague European notions of model communities contrasted with African values, ways of life and traditional activities. Land and property in the town appreciated in value, and craft industries and trade opened the way to personal prosperity. Around 1828 enterprising individuals secured the entrØe to the coast's new type of economy. In 1831 the colony was opened to foreign trade.

Throughout this teething period Western influence, including that of the missionaries, was crucial.\nThe British upper and ruling classes financed the churches and the smaller denominations, whose personnel had had no training whatsoever in anti-slavery or missionary work. Sierra Leone became their training ground. In addition to spreading Christianity and civilization the missions had to fight the slave trade, especially at Rio Pongos. But local slave-traders suspected these people of spying for the colonial government: they set fire to buildings of the Church Missionary Society who abandoned the field. In the colony itself, where political authority was conscious of its humanitarian mission, the missionaries were not unconscious of politics. MacCarthy put them in charge of the villages of freed slaves. In the civil administration, despite acute personal and doctrinal rivalries, the co-operation of powerful personalities with the government achieved sound long-term results.

Built in 1858 under the direct supervision of al-Hadjdj 'Umar himself, this fort was to keep all the Mande countries in order.$^{95}$ Mage was impressed by it, and tells us 'that it would present great difficulties to an attacking regular force'. The administration there was under the dual control of a Django freedman assisted by a taUb Racine Tall, a cousin of al-Hadjdj 'Umar.\nNioro was the biggest province under al-Hadjdj 'Umar. It had many fortresses, the most important being those of Farabugu, Dyangunte and Nioro itself. A big Fulbe and Torodbe colony occupied most of the villages from which the Massassi had been driven out. As the colonial power became more oppressive, the influx of immigrants from Futa increased.

We begin to observe that, in the nineteenth century, the predominant 'business of the state' was the aggregation of production and exchange, whether this process of accumulation was evolv› ing within the framework of the old domain or whether evolving beyond the effective administrative boundaries of the state. The control of pro› duction and exchange was very much at issue as states such as Rwanda, Buganda, Burundi, and Bunyoro enlarged their domains and expanded their range of influence in the nineteenth century.\nEarlier, note was made of Mawanda's programme of expansion into Kyaggwe. This eighteenth-century move was directed at productive regions lying beyond the control of the Buganda kingdom. Kyaggwe held barkcloth, iron ore and iron-working artisans, and it held access to the pro› ductive islands of the northern Lake Victoria area. The Buvuma Islands, offshore from Kyaggwe, were well linked into the trading networks of the eastern Lake Victoria area. The aggregation of productive forces, materials, skills, labour, and access to, or control over, the nodes of regional trade circuits were among the main items of business of the precolonial Lakes Plateau state.\nExtractions from routinely administered areas and extractions from outside the domain brought wealth into the courts and fed the governing regime. In the nineteenth century, extractions of tribute, with the opposed resistance to the extractions of the state, linked regions of production and regions of consumption in a broad network of 'conflict-driven' relations, while overlaying and affecting - and often deforming - the precolonial market networks that spanned the Lakes Plateau region. The interplay of state extraction and the resistance of producers and producing areas to coercion by the tribute-taking state is most apparent, in the nineteenth century, in the domain of food production, food exchange, and food consumption. Paradoxically, within this region of apparent, and much noted, abundance, the control of supplies of food appears to have moved to the centre of relations among states and relations between the state and producers. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.552, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 128, 'article_title': 'CHRISTIANSBORG', 'full_section_title': 'CHRISTIANSBORG', 'last_edit_date': '02-12-1863', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1863#article-7', 'issue_date': '23_03_1863', 'content': 'My dear Sir,—Whilst sorry on the one hand, that, in consequence of a blockade lately established, in order to bring the question of Kroboe Fine to a settlement, trade generally is, as it were, at a stand still; yet on the other hand, being full of hope that this temporary stagnation will result in future prosperity of this part of the country, we cheerfully submit to the plan which the new Governor, his Excellency Richard Pine, has adopted.\n\nIt is the general impression that his Excellency has hit upon the best plan of policy with regard to the Kroboe business, and that, I am glad to say, without bloodshed or any disturbance of the peace of the country, Governor Pine has succeeded in bringing the Kroboe chiefs to reason.\n\nIt is needless for me to observe that this Kroboe affair has for a long time been a great drawback to the prosperity of these districts in every respect, and therefore I feel it my duty to bring to your notice the fact that Governor Pine, who appears to be highly qualified for his exalted position amongst us, has, since his short residence with us, not only shown himself determined to remedy abuses under which we have been labouring, but has so far succeeded, that the long-pending question of the Kroboe fine seems now in course of being brought to a final settlement.\n\nYours, &c.,'}, {'id': 221, 'article_title': 'THE (COLONY OF THE) GOLD COAST.', 'full_section_title': 'THE (COLONY OF THE) GOLD COAST.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1863#article-9', 'issue_date': '23_10_1863', 'content': 'We are almost tired of calling attention to Gold Coast mismanagement.

Allow me, therefore, Mr. Editor, place for a few words? Is Governor Pine a man whose principles are opposed to peace? Is he much in fault? Has his administration deserved the insinuations, the sneers, and the blame heaped upon it? Could any official that we have yet known, do better than he has done in this Ashantee trial? We say, No. In our humble opinion, he is not to blame in anything with regard to this state of affairs, any more than it was in the power of any human being to overrule the course of things, or undo the wrong acts and avert the necessary consequences of past irregular Administrations? Do they who thus inconsiderately impugn the present Administration, bear in mind how very short a time this functionary had been on the Gold Coast and assumed the reins of government, before the invasion of our territories by the Ashantees took place? Is it not generally known on this Coast that the late sudden incursion had for its ostensible as well as real object the capture of Agiman, chief of eastern Akim? Now, let us quote General Owosookokoh\'s own words, in answer to the Governor\'s message as regards his cousin\'s (or father\'s) real object in ordering him to attack the Protectorate: ""My father,"" says the Ashantee general, ""has been insulted by Agiman, and for this reason he sent me down to take him to Coomassie."" Here we find no mention was made, not even an allusion to ""Gwanin,"" whose protection by the Governor some regard in a light so unfavourable. Then let us see how this *coup de main* of the lynx-eyed Quako Duah, King of the Ashantees, had been rendered easy by former maladministration (with which Governor Pine could never have anything to do except to be unjustly taxed for the results). A case comparatively trifling in the origin, and which, had it been timely looked into, would have saved much trouble and bloodshed, was shamefully mismanaged; and consequently terminated in a civil war between this Agiman and his nephew King Attah, of the Akims. After this bloody display of animosity, a disunion of course took place between these chiefs of Akim, which event was allowed to pass almost unnoticed in the proper quarters until very lately, when our present Governor, becoming aware of this gross neglect of his predecessor, and of the state of things at Akim, sent commissioners to arrange the dispute, which endangered the peace and safety of the whole Protectorate. We need scarcely add that had this want of unity between Agiman and Attah been prevented in time, the Ashantees would not have dared to make any such pretensions, much less to strike a blow, seeing that they understand very well the strength of the whole Akim in unity. The cowardly circumstances connected with the inroads of the Ashantees in 1853, and the sequel, clears off any doubt on this matter. They detained Captain Brownell in their camp. Essiamowah Quantah, their general, who dared not come nearer than Fosoway (fifty-two miles from the Coast), was afraid to let go so important a security as Captain Brownell\'s person until he saw his own army safely back at the other side of the Praah. And why was this general afraid to make a bold front when he found he could not coolly secure the object of his expedition, as did General Owosookokoh with impunity in the late campaign? Simply, because united Akim, on the side of the Protectorate, rendered his position rather too dangerous to attempt anything like that. But we say such a thing has been attempted latterly, and with success, too, by another Ashantee general, in the very heart of the country, within only a few hours\' journey from the Coast; and how? Simply, because Akim was dissevered, Agiman of eastern Akim at variance with his head, and thus the culpable negligence of a former Governor afforded Owosookokoh the chance of striking us and withdrawing in safety. How, then, is Governor Pine to blame in this matter? Why is this war ludicrously styled Pine\'s war? Governor Pine, unlike many of his predecessors, is faithful to his trust. Like David of old, he is a kind shepherd, that would on no account whatever leave the sheep at the mercy of the bear. Was it not his duty to snatch devoted Agiman and the rest of the protectorate from the paw of the Ashantee lion? As the representative of the protector of this protectorate, would it not have been considered rather a disgrace if he had denied Gwanin the protection he sued for? Is he, then, to be abused and depreciated in the estimation of the public just because he could not do everything—overrule the course of events and exceed the limits assigned to man? For our part, we do not believe in any such *superhumanum*. We only know this much of Governor Pine, that if his counsels, proposals, and plans were encouraged and carried out, this country would be strong against its usual enemies in time of war and improve in time of peace. This expression of our opinion dates so late as the 13th August, 1864. We do not, therefore, think it prematurely expressed: whereas we have yet to learn definitely in what Governor Pine has been to blame—his conduct in the Ashantee affair considered. Until this is demonstrated, our opinion remains unshaken by the sneers of disaffected men. Governor Pine has won most hearts in the community by his own merits. Most of the kings and chiefs of the Gold Coast like and love him. Merchants, respectable men and women of sound principles, love him—very unimportant few do otherwise, the majority of whom are of his skin, who perhaps do so abuse and misrepresent his administration out of the merest grudge.

The unsettled state of relations between the Fantee people and the Ashantees, aggravated by such acts on the part of some of the former as that recorded in our news from Cape Coast for the present month, is such as to justify very strong apprehensions of another invasion of the Fantee Countries by the King of Ashantee. With the uncertainty that at present attaches to the relations between the British authorities and the natives, as regards the nature and extent of protection which the former are to afford to the latter in the event of another of those cruel invasions which inflict so much injury on the country, it is most important that some pacific relations with the King of Ashantee should be again established, if practicable. We have never held the late Governor, Mr. Pine, responsible for the difficulties in which the last Ashantee troubles originated. These were known to exist before Mr. Pine left England to assume the government at Cape Coast. But without entering upon the question here as to the course pursued by Mr. Pine in dealing with those difficulties, it is sufficient to say that, in the opinion of everyone conversant with the people of the Gold Coast, and with the actual state of relations between Cape Coast and Ashantee, his continuance in charge of the administration at Cape Coast would have greatly increased the difficulties of the position. The appointment of Colonel Conran is therefore important, as removing what may be called the personal obstacles to a good understanding with Ashantee; while the concentration of the whole powers, civil and military, in the hands of one individual insures a unity of action that may exercise a decided influence on all parties on both sides of the river Prah, which separates Fantee from Ashantee. We have been assured that if there be a really good understanding between the native authorities at Cape Coast and the British Governor, such acts of violence on the Ashantee frontier as we have before alluded to may be easily and effectually repressed. We know of no reason why this good understanding should not now be arrived at. Colonel Conran is not a new man at Cape Coast. He and the natives have had two years' acquaintance, and he is said to have gained golden opinions among them. In congratulating both the Lieutenant-Governor and the natives on his appointment, we feel justified therefore in something like a confidence of hope that many scandals, and much that has been disgraceful to Great Britain there, will be put an end to at Cape Coast. A great amount of prudence and self-denial is requisite in the Governor if he would retain the trust and confidence of the natives, and uphold the character of this Christian country in all his public and private relations with them. We expect this from him, and from them a ready co-operation and obedience in all that is just and equitable; and if our expectations should be realized, as we hope and believe they will be, we shall have indeed an unfeigned pleasure in exhibiting to our readers, from month to month, a state of affairs at Cape Coast, and in the Gold Coast generally, such as has not, for a long time past existed in that portion of Western Africa."", 'last_edit_date': '1865-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1865#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Popular Aspirations on the Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A small Parliamentary paper recently issued contains reports from the Governor of the Gold Coast Settlements to Lord Knutsford on a tour made by the former in the eastern districts of his government.

At Pram Pram, the King, an old man, wanted nothing save to be allowed to revive an old custom, part of which consisted in the exhumation of the dead. At Quetta the chiefs and people said they had nothing to say about the state of the district of his Excellency, but they did desire that the duty on spirits, which had been lowered experimentally from 2s. 6d. to 1s. a gallon, might be lowered still further to 6d. a gallon; they were glad that the *ad valorem* duties were abolished, and complained that traders were molested on one of the roads. The Governor told them he was determined to stop the smuggling of rum, and advised them to cultivate cotton. The desired remission in duty on spirits appears to have been refused. The Afflowho chiefs were also warned against smuggling, and told the great advantages of growing cotton. At Big Awoonah the chief sent a friendly message, which the Governor acknowledged with a present of half a sovereign and two bottles of champagne. At Addah there was an important meeting; the people there wanted a road to the beach, a school, stipends to the chiefs, the reduction of the duty on rum to 1s. a gallon, wells, a public bell to mark the time, a free ferry across the Volta River, and a warehouse on the beach. To these the Governor replied that he would help them to make the road, but they must help themselves; that he could not see why they wanted a school, seeing that they had already two, of which they did not avail themselves; he could not promise them stipends or reduce the rum duty; they would have their bell, and would be shown how to sink wells; the ferry would be considered, and they could not want a warehouse on the beach. Here, again, smuggling and cotton came up as before. On the following day the chiefs expressed a wish to have another interview with the Governor. They pressed him to reduce the rum duty, and to give them stipends; but after a lengthy discussion the Governor succeeded in sending them away in good humour; but without cheaper rum or the stipends. They did not press him a second time on the school question. At Odumassie the King received the Governor in great state, and, in return, the latter impressed upon his Majesty, his chiefs, and women the importance of cotton, and the advantages of the Basle missionaries. The King begged for a pair of handcuffs to enforce his powers, and a lamp; King Akrobato, whose capital is two hours’ journey from that of the King of Odumassie, also wanted a lamp and handcuffs. At Akropong the King and chiefs gave the Governor the most imposing reception he had had. ""I expatiated as usual upon cotton and cocoa cultivation."" The King said that the cocoa plants the Governor had sent him had all failed; he and his chiefs were anxious to know how they could recover debts due to them, and they also wanted to be paid in cash in place of gin for palm oil. On the whole the situation appears to be this—the Government want the people to grow cotton, cocoa, and coffee, so that they may not be wholly dependent on palm oil; to go to school, not to molest travellers, not to smuggle, and to keep the roads and wells in order. The people do not appear to care about any of these things.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1888#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Abuses, Misgovernment, and Maladministration on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As regards Cape Coast, we must say that the whole system seems to be wrong and rotten in every part. We have before alluded to the composition of the Legislative Council—a Council composed of four commercial agents of one London firm. In our last we showed that one of these asserted his being possessed of power and influence over the head of the Government there to the extent of being able to influence and control all appointments. We do not believe this. We do not believe that Governor Pine is a man likely to allow himself to be made such a tool of. But we can imagine the case of a needy Governor and other public officials coming under pecuniary obligations to a leading member of a Legislative Council thus constituted, until all the power became virtually vested in him. And the possibility of such an abuse as this ought not to be allowed to exist. Then, again, we learn that the acting Civil Commandant for the important Eastern Districts—a young sub-agent of the same firm, and whose nomination to this office was obtained by one of the members of the Legislative Council—that this young man has taken for his chief counsellor and guide the Mr. James Bannerman who was last year sentenced to one year\'s imprisonment, &c., for gross abuses in the administration of justice, in complicity with Major de Ruvignes, the then Chief Civil Commandant, who surreptitiously left the Coast rather than meet the charges against him, and is now said to be shooting, for a wager, gorillas at the Gaboon. Is it any wonder that the Eastern Districts are disaffected? Is it any wonder that with a Legislative Council so constituted, there should be rumours that the Kroboe fine, the source of so many past evils, was to be the cause for fresh complications and disasters, fresh impolicy and injustice? ""Cæsar\'s wife should be not only pure, but above suspicion."" The abuses at the Gold Coast have reached a height that must, we think, induce some vigorous action on the part of the Colonial-office. But we despair of any effective measures until the anomalous position of the Gold Coast, as regards its connexion with the British Government, be totally changed. The British Government is in a false position there, and some decision as regards a change must soon be arrived at. Our views on this subject are well known. We are bound as a nation to the Gold Coast by ties that we cannot, dare not sever; and it becomes incumbent on us to assume such a position as may be made at the same time creditable to Great Britain and largely advantageous to Africa.

As a native of this Gold Coast, I take much interest in whatever appears in the African Times having reference to my country. Few in England know or care much about these settlements, where reside, nevertheless, several hundred thousand human beings, black indeed in colour, and for the most part half clothed, but very many of whom are perfectly capable of appreciating the comforts of life, and the benefit of a strong and efficient Government.  \nA Committee of the House of Commons is investigating the state of affairs here. It is time. Our little Augean stable requires cleansing. It may be that from time to time I shall take the liberty of addressing you, if my communications should be of any interest to your readers, or of service to my country and the cause of truth.  \nMr. Richard Pine, the Governor of Her Majesty's Forts and Settlements on the Gold Coast, is about to return to England, and will, doubtless, be examined before the Committee of the House. His Excellency returns to his own country covered with troubles as with a garment. He is at feud with our powerful and warlike neighbour, the King of Ashantee; he is on bad terms with the chiefs and people of what are called the Eastern Districts of these settlements—districts containing a thriving and industrious population of two or three hundred thousand persons; and there is an open rupture between his Excellency and the King of Cape Coast. So much for the natives. As regards the Europeans, it is known that his Excellency and the military authorities have, for a long time, not been on such terms as that they could co-operate cordially for the benefit of the Queen's service. In short, Governor Pine's hand is against every man, and every man's hand is against him.  \nThe public care not to hear of trifles, significant though they be to us here, who know how to construe their meaning; suffice it to say that the removal of Mr. Pine from this scene of his labours is regarded by the people without regret. His government has been fruitful of misfortunes for us. An unhappy war, needlessly provoked on his Excellency's part, rashly begun, badly conducted, complicated with occasional communications to the enemy in Bombastes Furioso style, ending ingloriously, nay ridiculously, as far as concerns British prestige on this Coast, fertile of destruction to the doomed and unhappy brave, whom a mistaken policy sent forth to perish uselessly, not by the bullet of the foe, but by the pestilential breath of the deadly demon who sits enthroned amidst the foul swamps and marshes which effectually protect the Ashantee frontiers from invasion; a system of arbitrary exactions and unprecedented interference with the details of every department of the public service, the military, the judicial, the ecclesiastical, causing much sore feeling, and an amount of confusion exceeding belief; the adoption of a practice of personally hearing causes between man and man (contrary to law) in the Government House, and with the assistance of a native interpreter whose practices and proceedings have not increased the public respect for the Government—these are the chief features that mark the administration of his Excellency Governor Pine.

The colony he was going to govern was the oldest British Colony on the West Coast of Africa, but it had not made that progress which it should have made considering the time they had had it. It was now about 300 years since the first occupation of the Gold Coast took place, but the Government had neglected the opportunities afforded for its advancement and development. However, largely on account of the action of the merchants in Liverpool and Manchester, and of England generally, a great deal more had been done in the last ten years to call attention to the importance of these colonies. They were now making better progress than ever before, and they relied upon his Excellency to see that this greater progress was continued. In the Colony he was going to administer there had been an excess of taxation over expenditure by some £200,000, which was lying in London unused. They urged that it was the duty of the Government to use it productively. Any excess in receipts should be used to make taxation more equal. He hoped that the new Governor would give his attention to this matter on his arrival on the coast. Another matter was the supply of water to the coast towns; and then there was the question of the railways. For years they had urged upon the Government the necessity for the construction of railways to the hinterland of the Gold Coast. They did not want to hurry the Government on this question, but if there was any progress to be made in this direction it was necessary something should be done to put them on an equality with other countries. It had been said that the first thing was to construct a harbour, for it would be impossible for the Government to land the material necessary for the construction of a railway unless there was a harbour where the goods could be landed. Latterly they had before them the proposed ordinance dealing with Crown concessions of land for mining or other purposes. He thought it was the first duty of the Government to see that such grants were utilised. The Section had sometimes complained or criticised some action, and he begged the Governor to believe any criticism of theirs upon any Governor or Government on the coast was done with the desire to co-operate with that Government or Governor to advance the welfare of the country in which they had all such interest. It was a great position his Excellency was going to fill. Governor Maxwell would have 2,000,000 human beings to care for, and he had the power to make or mar their happiness. It was a position of great responsibility, and it was one, in nine cases out of ten, filled with dignity and honour, and with a full regard for the welfare and the rights of the native population. At present Governor Maxwell was before them as an untried man as far as the West Coast was concerned, but his previous experiences would be of the greatest use to him amongst the natives of the West Coast. He might depend upon their support in everything calculated to advance the interests of the country which he was going to administer. He could only hope that Governor Maxwell would have good health to carry on the government successfully.

The new Governor will, no doubt, soon take possession. Dilatoriness has not been one of the characteristics of Doctor (now Sir) Samuel Rowe. As regards the late Governor Ussher, all we shall say is that he did not fulfil our expectations. We hope and believe that we shall never have to record a similar disappointment as regards Sir Samuel Rowe, who now goes to a colony where the finances are so far from being in a state of chronic embarrassment, that there are ample resources for inaugurating improvements much needed, but hitherto entirely neglected. Sir Samuel has now a fine field for the exercise of those talents which he undoubtedly possesses—energy, activity, and a determination that subordinate officials shall do their duty, and not idly fritter away the public revenues, which ought to be made available for stimulating progress and development.

He would first ask them to excuse him if he hesitated to give any decided indication of what was or was not possible in the directions indicated, but he was glad to know what the points were in which the Chamber was interested. They might rest assured that these would receive his best attention. The question of water supply was important, for good water was desirable in the interests of health and sanitation. It was a subject that received attention in the Colony he had left, where he had seen considerable waterworks erected, and at great cost. In a Dutch Colony in Sumatra he had seen an artesian well sunk in a mangrove swamp near the sea shore which turned an unhealthy district into a place fit for the habitation of Europeans. As far as the railway was concerned the delay might have been caused through the proposition of rival routes. If a railway was feasible, it would not be his fault if it was not very soon in hand. With regard to what the chairman had said about complaints, he would always be glad to receive any suggestions, but he must ask them to bear in mind that their object should be to get at the truth. He would welcome any criticism that had this object in view. The land ordinance was a subject he could not pretend he had mastered, and he could make no specific statement regarding it. It, however, seemed curious that such an ordinance should be required, and he thought something should have been done long ago. It would be a mistake to grant tracts of land to speculators who had no intention of using them, or who were unable to do so. In the colonisation of Australia the Government there laid it down that concessions to settlers by Natives would not be sanctioned by the Government. The circumstances might be different in Africa, where there were princes with a recognised jurisdiction, but it would have been better if it was understood that concessions other than those granted by the Government would not be recognised. With regard to the mining industry he would make it one of his first duties to see how far the Government could go to aid in the development of these resources. But he had seen mines that were very promising, but which turned out to be very unproductive, and it would be necessary to see that these mines were not of this nature before it would be wise to construct a railway at considerable expense to the district in which they were situated. As to the rivalry of other countries, he thought they were agreed that if other countries allowed free trade it did not matter what the port was, but other countries did not grant free trade. Still, other countries had their aspirations, and they had a right to colonise on their own account and develop their own trade. But there were such things as hostile protective tariffs, and his efforts would be directed towards the means of attracting as much trade as possible by developing the roads, &c. With regard to Ashanti, he did not yet know how far it was possible to carry out the establishment of a British Protectorate there, but he was sure that if the Natives knew the advantages they would welcome the change. However, until he arrived at the Gold Coast and discussed these matters on the spot he was unable to say anything positive. He would do his best to make the district a prosperous one.

The great Asante kingdom then comprised three types of territorial unit.\nFirst, there was the central group of Asante chiefdoms, long united under the authority of the Asantehene by the same language, geographical contiguity, a vast network of family ties and affinities, a century of common military activities and pride in their spectacular achievements. In addition, and fundamentally, there was the mystical bond of belief in the protecting power of the Golden Stool of the Asante and the spirits of the Asantehene's ancestors.$^{11}$ Membership in the union took the following tangible forms: participation by chiefs of member states in the enthronement of the head of state of Kumasi, the Asante sovereign, and the swearing of an oath of allegiance to him; attendance at the general assembly (nhyiamu) of chiefs at which major political matters (such as war, peace and treaties) were discussed, and acceptance of the great Asante oath as the supreme instru› ment of justice for all of the Asantehene's territories. 12 These integrative institutions constituted the fundamental bases of the state machinery. They were to be found in all the Akan states as well as in Asante, which meant that the idea of the legitimacy of power through conquest had replaced that of political identity established through kinship and religion.

There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.621, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Political structures', 'content': 'The Mfecane spread far and wide a new model of the northern Nguni state as revolutionized by Shaka.

In the Akan regions they had to ensure that disputes were settled by enforcing observance of the Asantehene's oath so as to emphasize his sovereignty over these territories.

Wilks, 1975, ch. 2. observers as a form of exploitation, was no problem for the Asantehene, since Asante states themselves had to bear the same burdens.15 The real problem was territorial sovereignty. In non-Akan regions, the com¬ missioners strove to strengthen the terms of the 'treaty' between the Asantehene and the Dagomba, for example,16 concerning the tribute.

The founders of these states put much emphasis on strong defensible positions.

With regard also to the Ashantees now in Aöwin, the King states that Andor, the Elmina chief, was sent up to Coomassie in attendance at the late King's funeral rites, and as he had since received information that the road to Elmina by Prahsue had been blockaded or stopped, he considered it safe and prudent to send him back to Elmina by the Aöwin direction, duly escorted by one of his captains, Ackampon Asantoo, with troops, who himself had been trained up at Elmina, with instructions to the King of Aöwin to have a passage procured for him for his conveyance by water down to Elmina."", 'last_edit_date': '1869-12-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1870#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.623, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CAPE COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""At the time that the Ashantees invaded these Protected Territories last year, Quacoe Duah, King of Ashantee, sent messengers to Darko Yaw with several presents, including a gold ammunition pouch and 200 oz. of gold dust, as an inducement for him to secede with his people from the alliance formed between himself and the other chiefs of the Accra or Eastern District, and come over to his side and assist his troops in the invasion of the Coast by the eastern route. These facts were at the time only suspected, but within the last few days they became matters of certainty. It appears that the King of Ashantee had arranged with Darko Yaw to come over to his side with all his chiefs and people, and in case the latter should decline to join, Quacoe Duah promised to send a small but efficient force to escort Darko Yaw and his immediate adherents within the Ashantee lines; after which a larger army was to proceed without delay to reduce the refractory Aquamboe chiefs to subjection, and then the whole were to march on to Accra through the Aquapem Mountains. It was also stipulated by Quacoe Duah that in order to prove his sincerity and desire to return to his former master, Darko Yaw should, when he was ready to start for Coomassie, send to Coomassie by certain confidential messengers of Quacoe Duah's then in Aquamboe, the heads of all those Ashantee chiefs that were killed by the Aquamboe part of the allied forces at the Battle of Dodowah in the year 1826, and which were kept as trophies in their hands. Darko Yaw having made all his preparations without the knowledge of his chiefs, secretly despatched the heads of the deceased Ashantee chiefs to Coomassie, and was about to follow with such few of his personal adherents as were privy to the conspiracy, when the whole affair was revealed to the chiefs by a mere accident. The chiefs at once assembled, consulted together, and resolved to act promptly, as the next day would see their King in the midst of the Ashantee force sent to escort him. It was agreed that they should go to the King, there and then, and if he could not give them a satisfactory account of his recent conduct, they should at once kill him. They went to his palace, and told him that they had come to consult with him what was best to be done to avert dangers that appeared to be coming upon them from different quarters, alluding to the threats and suspicions of the British Government and their native allies, that they were going over to the enemy. During the consultation the principal fetish priest counselled them to seek advice from their grand fetish. It was then resolved that they should all proceed to the village of Quajoe Osoo and consult the fetish. They went there with the King, who had not the slightest suspicion of their intentions; and everything being ready, the fetish priest was asked to tell what was the cause of all their recent misfortunes, and what they should do to avert further calamities. The priest replied, that they must at once send for the heads of the Ashantee chiefs that were in the King's possession, and perform certain rites over them. The King upon this displayed great uneasiness, and endeavoured to treat the matter as a joke, but the chiefs insisted on the production of the trophies, which, however, were not forthcoming. This being considered clear proof of the King's guilt, one of the chiefs pushed his chair from under him, another struck him with one of his own musical horns, which he took from an attendant, the rest then despatched him with clubs and cut him to pieces."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-04-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1864#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.607, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'GOLD COAST', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""It is not unlikely that ere this time you have received information about the pending danger which threatens this coast. We have for the last three months been anticipating what, to all intents and purposes, will prove a reality—viz., a war with the King of Ashantee. In November last, one of the captains of the King being ordered up to Comasie, on a charge of robbing what is regarded as the King's quota of gold, and being apprehensive that the issue would cost his head, escaped with eighty adherents from the kingdom of Ashantee to the coast, and claimed protection from the English Government. The King immediately sent one of his principal chieftains, with a number of sword-bearers, to request that the captain and his men should be given up. On his arrival at Cape Coast Castle a grand palaver was held, in which were present the Governor and Council, the principal merchants at Cape Coast and its vicinity, the chiefs and head men of Cape Coast, the runaway chief, as well as the King's messengers. After a long palaver, the last were unable to substantiate the charges against the man, who swore that he would rather have his head cut off before the fort gate than that he should be sent up to Comasie. After long deliberation it was unanimously agreed that the captain and his followers were not to be delivered up until the King should send down witnesses to corroborate the charges alleged against him. The King demanded that the men should be delivered up unconditionally; or, if not, the Governor must stand the consequence. During this time it was noticed that Ashantees, who came down as peaceful traders, bought almost wholly guns, powder, and lead bar, articles which are decidedly munitions of war. The chiefs in the interior got alarmed at this, and seized the articles as the men passed along their territory. Intelligence of this reached Comasie, and from that time the King gave orders to his captains to make preparations for an invasion. In the meantime the King sent to inform the Governor that he had broken the treaty with his Government, and that he (the King) was going to send down one of his captains, who was then in the interior, to show the Governor the treaty. The Governor promised, whenever that should be done, to deliver the captain up, and even escort him to the frontiers of the King of Ashantee with British soldiers. The next information that reached the coast was that a large Ashantee army had crossed the river Prah (the boundary line between the protectorate territory and the kingdom of his Majesty King Quaku Duah) towards the eastern district, and that the King of Akim had fallen back before them to get the support of the tribes on the seashore. A few days afterwards another army crossed the Prah at Assin, in a direct road to Anamaboe and Cape Coast. Most of the men on the seacoast who are able to bear arms have left for the Fantee camp, at the neighbourhood of Assin, where at least about 14,000 men are at present, waiting the movements of the Ashantees. Scouts have been sent out, and some Ashantee heads have been sent down, to corroborate the report that the Ashantees have invaded the Fantee territory. The report is just now current that pickets of the army of Ajeman, King of Western Akim, met an Ashantee pillaging band, fired at them, and wounded their leader, who was brought before the King as a prisoner. He begged hard for his life, and promised to reveal everything about the war. He was made to swear by his King's stool that all that he was about to say were facts. The information he gave was the following: The King, on hearing that the Governor refused to deliver up the men, turned out all the available force, numbering about 60,000 men. Of these, 20,000 were to form a corps of observation on the eastern district, by descending on Akim, and thus preventing the Accras, Aquamhus, and Akims from joining the Fantees, and the remaining 40,000 were to descend upon the Fantees through Assin, sweeping everything before them, until they arrive at Cape Coast and Anamaboe, both of which places they intend to sack; the victorious were then to march against the Accras. So that, perhaps before you receive this account, we might all have been massacred by these brutal Ashantees; but we are determined to give them a most hearty reception."", 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.609, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ASHANTI PEERAGE SYSTEM', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We are glad to have had the opportunity of obtaining a copy of the interesting letter, which we publish to-day, of Prince Ansah, written by the direction of the King of Ashantee, to Surgeon-Major Horton. The personal aspect of the matter is to us of little significance; and, probably, it is so to Dr. Horton himself, of whose personal merits the letter is not an unimportant record. Its chief value consists in unfolding of the laws and institutions of the powerful Negro kingdom, a feature which shows that the power of that kingdom is not based entirely upon a blind reverence for bodily strength and martial prowess. The Ashantees acknowledge the advantage of encouraging every virtue, the direction of which is to advance the interest of the country, by enlisting amongst the nobility any person who distinguishes himself in the patriotic display of every such virtue. It is no wonder that their warriors fight to death, with true Spartan bravery, when they know that the meanest subject may, by valour—which now furnishes the chief means for patriotic advancement of the interests of the kingdom—create for himself a position equal to that of the best born of the land. This system of ennobling the meritorious as a reward for public services, prevails somewhat amongst the Dahomans. It is a mistake, therefore, to suppose that it is the fear of death alone, from an enraged monarch, that moves either the Ashantee or Dahoman soldier to court death by brave deeds in war, rather than return home under an ignominious sense of defeat to meet a more ignominious death. Skertchly, in his book on Dahomey, states that he was made a peer of the realm by Gelele for his services in teaching the native soldiery the use of certain guns.

Convinced of the hopelessness of expecting that peace could be maintained so long as the Fantees and other tribes remained subject to the exactions and oppressions of their former rulers, and yet foreseeing at the same time the dangers which must result if so large a body of natives, composed of different tribes, and having different interests and views, were left to carry on their affairs without the control or guidance of any superior power, believing moreover that the influence of such a superior and civilised power would help to work valuable reforms among the most turbulent and lawless of them, he conceived the idea of compelling from the King of Ashantee an acknowledgment of their independence, and by the influence over them which our interference on their behalf had obtained for us, of inducing them to band themselves together under our guidance and control for protection against the common enemy. These important objects were at length secured by the signing of a treaty, on the 27th April, 1831, between the Governor, the Ashantees, and the Fantee and other tribes then in alliance with us, and during the next twelve years the results of this arrangement under the administration of Governor Maclean are detailed in the report of the committee of 1842, ""there was exercised a very wholesome influence over a coast not much less than 150 miles in extent, and to a considerable distance inland, preventing within that range external slave trade, maintaining peace and security, and exercising a useful, though irregular, jurisdiction among the neighbouring tribes, and much mitigating, and in some cases extinguishing some of the most atrocious practices which had prevailed among them unchecked before.""\n\nIn consequence of the recommendation of this committee, the direct management of the Gold Coast Settlements was in 1844 resumed by the Imperial Government, and at first placed under the jurisdiction of Sierra Leone; but in 1850 it was by letters patent created into a separate Government with executive and legislative councils for the administration of its affairs, an arrangement which continues at the present time.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1865#article-26', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.622, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Pretensions and Threats of Ashantee', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—You will perhaps be surprised to hear of the most insulting message which the King of Ashantee has sent to the Fantee kings, through Mr. Simpson, the Acting Administrator.

Although Government has blockaded our frontiers toward the Ashantee territory, yet this part of the country, on the river Volta, is totally neglected, and now open to the Ashantees, where they receive all the munitions of war. In consequence of this, a vigorous trade is going on from this and Adda and Quittah, in salt, tobacco, gin, arms, and gunpowder, in exchange for gold dust and slaves. This is a policy that we stupid people here don't understand. Through this neglect the Ashantees have lately committed some outrages here.\n\nSome time last month the messengers of the King of Ashantee arrived here in the town of Assabi, in the district of Krepee, and under cover of night cut off the heads of two of Her Majesty's subjects, by names Quamlin Savili and Kuaku Dabonnie, natives of Assabi, in our Krepee jurisdiction.\n\nIt has since come out that this outrage was committed by sanction and connivance of the chief of Assabi, by name Quamlin Minta, who is supposed to be intriguing with the Ashantees. On investigating the case before the supreme chief, Nijarkon, it was further proved that Minta has had a criminal connexion with the wife of one of the unfortunate men. He is now bailed out before Chief Nijarkon till something is heard from proper authorities.

It is valuable for history of the war, because it seems to show both sides of the question with great impartiality:—\n\n""The ostensible cause of the war is the detention by the British authorities of the runaway captain and eight men from Ashantee, who took refuge in the protected territory. The King of Ashantee was determined to have this man given up to him; but the conditions required by his Excellency Governor Pine, which were just and humane, the King of Ashantee was unable to comply with. Viewing the case impartially, one is led to conclude that both parties are justified in what they have done—the Governor for protecting the man, and the King for declaring war by crossing the Prah, the boundary of the respective territories.\n\n""The Governor is perfectly justified, because, according to the British law, a refugee who cannot be proved to have committed any crime, and who claims protection from our Government, cannot legally be delivered up to a tyrant or a despotic Government, where will is arbitrary in actions. It is well known that the life of these men, if they had been delivered up, would have been sacrificed. No sooner would they have crossed the frontier, than their heads would have been taken off and sent to the King of Ashantee at Comassie. No mercy would be shown to them, and no promise of sparing their lives that might be made to the Governor would be worthy of the least consideration.\n\n""The King is right in declaring war, because—\n\n""Firstly, the very throne on which he sits is at stake. Should he not have acted promptly in this affair, his people would have branded him as a coward unworthy to occupy the stool of the long-famed and brave Kings of Ashantee.\n\n""Secondly, should he have allowed the refugees to remain quietly with us, without making any demonstration regarding them, more important men would also have soon crossed from his territory to seek protection and security under the quiet rule of our Government. It behoved the King, therefore, to show that they could not do this with impunity.\n\n""Thirdly, the peaceful traders of the King of Ashantee had, before there was any commencement of war by him, been molested by the Fantees, their goods seized, and the men themselves put in irons. They were only released by order of Governor Pine, and no compensation was given to them.\n\n""Fourthly, the King of Ashantee\'s generals and captains will, on such an occasion, swear the great oath—viz., that the King has received an unpardonable insult, and that they are determined to avenge it.

It concludes as follows: ""When once a position has been gained, it is to be held resolutely. In warfare of this nature, there must be no retreats. No village or camp is to be set on fire except by order of the major-general commanding; officers and men are reminded of the danger and delay which occur if a village is set on fire before all the ammunition and baggage have made their way through it. All plundering and unnecessary destruction of property are to be strictly repressed; officers are to be strictly responsible that, when a village or camp is occupied, their men are kept together, and prevented from dispersing to seek plunder. The importance of kindness from all ranks to the friendly natives, who are employed as carriers, is strongly urged: if the carriers are ill-treated, the troops run imminent risk of being left without food and ammunition. It must never be forgotten by the soldiers that Providence has implanted in the heart of every native of Africa a superstitious awe and dread of the white man, that prevents the negro from daring to meet him face to face in combat. A steady advance or a charge, no matter how partial, if made with determination, always means the retreat of the enemy. Although, when at a distance, and even when under a heavy fire, the Ashantees seem brave enough, from their practice of yelling and singing and beating drums in order to frighten the enemies of their own colour with whom they are accustomed to make war, they will not stand against the advance of the white man. English soldiers and sailors are accustomed to fight against immense odds in all parts of the world. It is scarcely necessary to remind them that when in our battles beyond the Prah they find themselves surrounded on all sides by hordes of howling enemies, they must rely upon their old British courage and discipline, and upon the courage of their comrades.

The great Asante kingdom then comprised three types of territorial unit.\nFirst, there was the central group of Asante chiefdoms, long united under the authority of the Asantehene by the same language, geographical contiguity, a vast network of family ties and affinities, a century of common military activities and pride in their spectacular achievements. In addition, and fundamentally, there was the mystical bond of belief in the protecting power of the Golden Stool of the Asante and the spirits of the Asantehene's ancestors.$^{11}$ Membership in the union took the following tangible forms: participation by chiefs of member states in the enthronement of the head of state of Kumasi, the Asante sovereign, and the swearing of an oath of allegiance to him; attendance at the general assembly (nhyiamu) of chiefs at which major political matters (such as war, peace and treaties) were discussed, and acceptance of the great Asante oath as the supreme instru› ment of justice for all of the Asantehene's territories. 12 These integrative institutions constituted the fundamental bases of the state machinery. They were to be found in all the Akan states as well as in Asante, which meant that the idea of the legitimacy of power through conquest had replaced that of political identity established through kinship and religion. The second category of states in this vast empire was therefore the Akan states bordering Asante territory. The peoples of these states understood the meaning of these institutions.

It wielded undisputed economic and political power over the coast and over the dependent kingdoms to the north. Towards the centre, kingdoms associated with the Oyoko clan from Kumasi gradually became subjugated and tributary on account of structural reforms carried out by Osei Kodjo, first, in the kingdom of Kumasi, and then at the expense of the neighbouring Akan kingdoms: Mampong, Nsuta, Dwaben, Bekwai, Kokofu, Bono, as also Denkyira, Ahafo, Sefwi, Adansi, etc. In this region, the Kumasihene (king of Kumasi) became the Asantehene. From this base, the Asante dynasty held political and economic sway over the coastal kingdoms (Wassa, Nzima, Twifu, Akwamu, Akyem, Akuapem, Ga and Adangbe), and more especially the coastal strip of the Fante chief› taincies. Similarly, to the north, the kingdoms of Gyaman, Gonja, Dagomba and Mamprusi came under the sway of Asante, sanctioned by a yearly tribute (ayibuade) of two thousand slaves, especially after the 1794 treaty.\nThe nineteenth century was to start with the reign of one of the greatest of the Asantehenes, Osei Bonsu (1801-24), whose victorious armies pushed through to the coast in a series of campaigns (1807, 1811 and 1814). The British, who at the time were caught up in the Napoleonic Wars and had no clear policy for their Gold Coast settlements, could not but recognize, through the President of the Council of Merchants, Colonel Torrane, and his successors, the reality of the suzerainty, or even sovereignty, of Asante over all the coastal peoples.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': ""However, with the Akan states the problem was essentially one of sovereignty. There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Political structures', 'content': ""Notable examples of this tendency were the initial impact of the Mfecane, and the impact of trade and the Chokwe and Ovimbundu expansion on the Luba and Lunda state systems.$^{4}$ Several states and empires disappeared.

But the last straw that really precipitated action was the demand of the British governor, Arnold Hodgson, for the Golden Stool to be sent to him so that he could sit on it.

His influence through all the troubled times of Uganda had done much to ensure the safety of British communications with the east coast'.$^{20}$ The same sentiments were echoed by another colonial official on the occasion of Mumia's death in 1949.

In repayment for the opportunity to use the king's land and benefit from his divine prowess, his subjects were expected to provide specified taxes, labour service and tribute that varied from one kingdom to another.

No action has yet occurred, but our forces are mustered at three different points of our frontier: At the back of Cape Coast and Anamaboe we have some 20,000; at the back of Ninnebah about 50,000. The Denkeras and Wassaus 20,000 more. Besides this, the Accras, Akims, Aquapems, and Kroboes will muster some 50,000 more. There is no doubt that we could bring 150,000, if not 200,000,* men to the field, but it is equally certain that 50,000 Ashantees will, *as affairs are at present,* be more than a match for us. The movements of Quaku Duah's army are up to this hour enveloped in the most impenetrable mystery. Although his forces have been thirty-three days in our territory, we cannot obtain intelligence of a reliable nature regarding them. Our people have captured several of their scouts and spies; but they are so exasperated against the Ashantees, that, unfortunately, they execute them instantly they are caught; but the last spy stated before his head was off that his master had sworn to sweep the Coast now and for ever, and that he had a force of 80,000, divided into three armies. The Government, not having made up their minds that his Majesty Quaku Duah really meant war, have until now left the natives to shift for themselves. Great preparations are certainly being made at the different forts, but very slowly. Some people have an idea that Quaku Duah is a king of about the same calibre as those in the vicinity of Sierra Leone, and that he can be disposed of by three companies of the 2nd West India Regiment. But the power of Ashantee, like that of Dahomey, is of a very different class; and Ashantee is more powerful than Dahomey. Commodore Wilmot has recently returned from Dahomey; he is now at Cape Coast, consulting with our Governor as to the measures to be adopted in the present crisis.

No one knew of the king's death but the principal Ocrah in the palace, and as the principal chiefs went to pay their accustomed respects to their sovereign they were all seized, the door locked, and everyone was slaughtered there and then to accompany the king to the other world.

I am happy, however, to say that Prince Ansah assured me he did not imbrue his hands in human blood, although he could if he had liked, and in fact he was expected to do his share, but he wisely and creditably declined the honour, and in giving me a history of the fearful doings at Ashantee, he appeared to be as horrified as I was at the barbarities he was forced to gaze on. Two instances of great devotion were displayed by two of the late king's wives; they followed the procession to the grave, and as their lord the king was placed in his sepulchre, they drank bowls of poison and threw themselves alongside of him. The rest of his wives were decapitated by force. The prince informs me that the stench in Kumasi was dreadful, and he was glad to get away from the horrors that surrounded him. The King Quacoe Duah had reigned thirty-seven years, the longest reign known in Ashantee. He is succeeded by his nephew, named Coffee Culcary, who has ascended the throne of his uncle, the late King, and is about thirty-five years old. He is very fond of Prince John Osso Ansah, and it is to be hoped the Government will see the desirability of encouraging the Prince in frequent visits to Kumasi, so that he may by his experience of European manners and customs induce his less fortunate relations in Kumasi to imitate and practise them.

Its chief value consists in unfolding of the laws and institutions of the powerful Negro kingdom, a feature which shows that the power of that kingdom is not based entirely upon a blind reverence for bodily strength and martial prowess. The Ashantees acknowledge the advantage of encouraging every virtue, the direction of which is to advance the interest of the country, by enlisting amongst the nobility any person who distinguishes himself in the patriotic display of every such virtue.

It wielded undisputed economic and political power over the coast and over the dependent kingdoms to the north. Towards the centre, kingdoms associated with the Oyoko clan from Kumasi gradually became subjugated and tributary on account of structural reforms carried out by Osei Kodjo, first, in the kingdom of Kumasi, and then at the expense of the neighbouring Akan kingdoms: Mampong, Nsuta, Dwaben, Bekwai, Kokofu, Bono, as also Denkyira, Ahafo, Sefwi, Adansi, etc. In this region, the Kumasihene (king of Kumasi) became the Asantehene. From this base, the Asante dynasty held political and economic sway over the coastal kingdoms (Wassa, Nzima, Twifu, Akwamu, Akyem, Akuapem, Ga and Adangbe), and more especially the coastal strip of the Fante chief› taincies. Similarly, to the north, the kingdoms of Gyaman, Gonja, Dagomba and Mamprusi came under the sway of Asante, sanctioned by a yearly tribute (ayibuade) of two thousand slaves, especially after the 1794 treaty.\nThe nineteenth century was to start with the reign of one of the greatest of the Asantehenes, Osei Bonsu (1801-24), whose victorious armies pushed through to the coast in a series of campaigns (1807, 1811 and 1814). The British, who at the time were caught up in the Napoleonic Wars and had no clear policy for their Gold Coast settlements, could not but recognize, through the President of the Council of Merchants, Colonel Torrane, and his successors, the reality of the suzerainty, or even sovereignty, of Asante over all the coastal peoples.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.728, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': ""However, with the Akan states the problem was essentially one of sovereignty. There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.73, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': ""The unrivalled power of Asante during the eighteenth and early nine› teenth centuries had of course been ultimately due to its favourable inter› mediary position between two poles, that is, the Niger Bend and the coast of the Gulf of Guinea, but also to its leaders' skill in political and administrative organization.$^{10}$ During the early nineteenth century, this system reached a high degree of perfection and efficiency, which alone justified its growing expansion until it engulfed the Fante states. The great Asante kingdom then comprised three types of territorial unit.\nFirst, there was the central group of Asante chiefdoms, long united under the authority of the Asantehene by the same language, geographical contiguity, a vast network of family ties and affinities, a century of common military activities and pride in their spectacular achievements. In addition, and fundamentally, there was the mystical bond of belief in the protecting power of the Golden Stool of the Asante and the spirits of the Asantehene's ancestors.$^{11}$ Membership in the union took the following tangible forms: participation by chiefs of member states in the enthronement of the head of state of Kumasi, the Asante sovereign, and the swearing of an oath of allegiance to him; attendance at the general assembly (nhyiamu) of chiefs at which major political matters (such as war, peace and treaties) were discussed, and acceptance of the great Asante oath as the supreme instru› ment of justice for all of the Asantehene's territories. 12 These integrative institutions constituted the fundamental bases of the state machinery. They were to be found in all the Akan states as well as in Asante, which meant that the idea of the legitimacy of power through conquest had replaced that of political identity established through kinship and religion. The second category of states in this vast empire was therefore the Akan states bordering Asante territory. The peoples of these states understood the meaning of these institutions.

They also supplied, in the form of tribute, a large part of the manpower used in Asante wars and agriculture.$^{13}$ This significant distinction has been contested on the grounds that economic and political motivations existed in all the Asante wars. In a similar vein, references have been made to the presence of Asante representatives in all types of states and also to the introduction of substantial Asante features into the Dagomba army or interventions by the Asantehene in Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes. 14 It is obvious nevertheless that the mandates of the Asante regional commissioners varied according to the situation. In the Akan regions they had to ensure that disputes were settled by enforcing observance of the Asantehene's oath so as to emphasize his sovereignty over these territories. The collection of taxes in these regions, seen by contemporary European ii. Cf. R.S. Rattray, 1929, pp. 398-409; K.A. Busia, 1951; I. Wilks, 1975, ch. 2. observers as a form of exploitation, was no problem for the Asantehene, since Asante states themselves had to bear the same burdens.15 The real problem was territorial sovereignty. In non-Akan regions, the com¬ missioners strove to strengthen the terms of the 'treaty' between the Asantehene and the Dagomba, for example,16 concerning the tribute. On the other hand, we have no evidence confirming the presence of Gonja or Dagomba contingents in the Asante army or of payment by these countries of the Asante war tax (apeatoo). The settlement of the Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes must therefore be considered as a political act with economic motives: peace in these territories guaranteed payment of the tribute, as well as the introduction of Asante institutions into the Dagomba army.

In 1850 and 1863 war was narrowly averted but between 1869 and 1872, the Asante launched a three-pronged attack which resulted in the occupation of virtually all the southern and coastal states of the Gold Coast. To beat back the Asante, the British government launched one of the best organized campaigns of the period under the command of one of the most famous British officers of the day, General Garnet Wolseley. Armed with the latest weapons, this army succeeded in pushing the Asante army across the Pra river and entered and sacked Kumasi in February 1874 after a very fierce last-ditch stand by the Asante army at Amoafo near Bekwai. 40 This decisive defeat of the Asante by the British in 1874 had very far-reaching consequences and was to influence, to a great extent, the reactions of the Asante during the period 1880-1900. The first obvious effect was the disintegration of the Asante empire. By the Treaty of Fomena, Asante recognized the independence of all the vassal states south of the Pra. Taking advantage of the weakening of the military power of Asante, the vassal states to the north of the Volta river also broke away. Even the core of the empire that remained began to break up.

Such a rivalry occurred in the kingdom of Wagadugu, where Mogho Naaba Karfo (1842-9) decided to distribute to the poor among the common people the property that he had confiscated from the wealthy. In dispensing justice, he was accessible to noble and commoner alike. It is highly likely that this social policy was a factor in the great rebellion of the princes that broke out in his reign at the instigation of the most important of his ministers, the Widi Naaba.\nLastly, we may mention the coastal lands, where the driving forces of trade and education were producing a qualitatively new type of social stratification. Once the basis of commercial activity had shifted from the slave trade to the exchange of palm oil, rubber, ivory and gold for European products, a new merchant class emerged, operating with stocks of trade goods advanced by European companies, whose agents they actually were. Thus began the careers of a number of great merchants with establishments in the coastal centres. At a lower level, swarms of petty dealers who played the role of door-to-door salesmen to the suppliers gravitated around the great merchants, on whom they were dependent.$^{62}$ The Asante merchants who, for their part, controlled the supply of products from the interior of Africa, namely the akonkofo, also constituted a factor to be reckoned with. 63 In much the same way, in the field of education new categories, or even entire social classes, came into being along the coast. At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone. These people were regarded as 'English gentlemen', and behaved accordingly. They were accepted in European circles and rose to positions of responsibility as magistrates, commanders of forts and the like.

The King of Djuabin, not to be backward, has directed one of his chiefs to ascertain whether in reality his territory has been invaded; if so, to inform him thereof; but on no account to fire on the enemy. This does not appear to have been long left in doubt, for the advance-guard of King Mensah\'s force was found in possession of a Djuabin village, the people of which had been induced to join the opposite ranks. Assafoo-agay\'s men were fired upon, and one of them shot; they did not return the fire, but attempted to capture some of the Kumasi men, but were not successful. Since then, we learn, that Assafoo-agay has sent to Mensah to complain of this, but instead of obtaining redress, his messengers were treated with contumely. This conduct has led the King of Djuabin to send down messengers to Governor Strahan to acquaint him with all that has occurred, and to inform the Government that if the peace be broken it will not have been brought about by him.\n\n""Information has reached us also that the Gamans, and other former tributaries of Ashanti, inland, have sent to Assafoo-agay to make common cause with them against the Kumasi people, as they are determined to completely break up the power of the King of Ashanti; and if the Djuabins will not join them in the enterprise, they will take the field against Assafoo-agay and the King of Ashanti as their common foes.\n\n""It is rumoured that the Akims will join the Djuabins if Assafoo-agay resolves on fighting; and from all we can learn, fight he will, unless Governor Strahan directs otherwise.\n\n""The interior tributaries of Ashanti are longing to reach the sea-coast; they wish to destroy the power of Ashanti, so that they may be able to come down here to trade in peace, and the road into the interior be opened to commercial enterprise. Edin Kera, the King of Gaman, is exceedingly anxious to have the sole obstacle in the way of his people passing by the direct route to the Coast removed, and knowing, as he does now, that the power of Ashanti has been considerably weakened, he will not fail to take advantage of the favourable opportunity. He awaits the reply of Assafoo-agay, and the latter is now only desirous of learning the views of the Government, before deciding on the course of action to be adopted by him.\n\n""Reports from King Mensah state that two of his villages have been destroyed by the Djuabins.\n\n""We learn also that the Akims and other border tribes are likely to join the Djuabins and others, and that the Government declines to interfere one way or the other in this affair.', 'last_edit_date': '1875-08-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_08_1875#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.07, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE MISSION TO KUMASI.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""In order to understand the revolution which is now occurring in Ashanti and the purpose of Captain Lee's mission to Kumasi, it will be necessary to consider for a moment the real nature of the kingdom which is or was governed by Calcalli, and if we trace it to its origin we find that about 200 years ago the Ashantees were a small tribe, vassals of Denkyera, then a powerful state, now part of our Protectorate. The Ashantees being ill-treated, rebelled, gained their independence, and founded Kumasi. They were surrounded by small kingdoms—Becqua, Kokofo, Mampom, Adansi, and Juabin—all of which they conquered; but these states still remained under their own kings, who paid tribute to the King of Ashanti, contributed soldiers when he went to war, attended the capital at certain festivals, and were summoned, as occasion arose, to councils, at which each chief or king spoke in turn, according to his rank. Thus it will be seen that the Ashanti nation was not homogeneous, but composed of various kingdoms which cherished the tradition of their independent sovereignty, which were held together more by the fear of punishment, and which were prepared at any time to secede from tyranny and taxation should any misfortune befall the imperial tribe. This seceding or separating process had already commenced before our troops were out of Ashanti. The Chief of Adansi and his people had been much oppressed by Ashanti. He resisted the white men, but as soon as Kumasi had been taken and the struggle decided he determined to throw off his ancient yoke and place himself in the hands of the stronger and also more merciful Power. He met Sir G. Wolseley in the ruins of Fomano, his own capital, and there made arrangements for migrating into the Protectorate. At the same time a rumour reached the General that the Chief or King of Becqua desired to follow the example of Adansi. Becqua is a powerful state, and its capital which our troops destroyed was not much smaller than Kumasi. Finally, the King of Juabin sent in his submission to Glorer, and afterwards began negotiations with the King of Eastern Akim, with a view to migration to that country. It seems that Becqua and Juabin have now determined to hold their own territory, to cast off their allegiance, and to resist any attempt that Calcalli may make to subdue them. Becqua is supported by Denkyera, and Juabin by Akim. Kumasi and its territory lie just between the rebellious states, and it is, to say the least, doubtful whether Kokofo and Mampom will assist the Ashantees, whose kingdom seems now reduced to its first elements—viz., a small tribe, a city which we may assume is not yet perfectly rebuilt, and a few plantation villages. It is, therefore, not surprising that the King should have sent to the white men for help. He says that he wants peace, and that war will be bad for trade; but as his messengers have passed without being molested through the Becqua territory, it is quite evident that these Becquas do not intend to be the aggressors. They were once free, they became slaves, and now they wish to be free again. Half a century ago, when Bowdich visited Kumasi, Juabin was an independent Power allied with Ashanti; and the early treaties with the English are in the joint names of Ashanti and Juabin. What more natural and laudable than that its chief should desire to regain the power which Ashantea craft and crime had taken from his ancestors? It is to be hoped that Calcalli will be made to understand that we do not deplore the misfortunes which his arrogance and exactions have brought upon himself, and that an attempt to subdue his rebellious vassals will meet with no sympathy from the British Government. A civil war in Ashanti would be injurious to trade, but it is not probable that the Ashantees will make war upon their neighbours. In the long run trade will certainly profit by the dissolution of the kingdom. If Ashanti had retained its ancient imperial power, war would have been the one occupation of that people, as it has been for the last 200 years. They might not have dared to invade the Protectorate, but they had plenty of other hunting grounds. Nor is it probable that the King would have ever made Ashanti a thoroughfare. Behind that country, to the north, are tribes rich in gold and cotton, who desire to reach the sea and trade with Europeans. It has always been the policy of Ashanti to check this enterprising spirit, and so to monopolize the trade. Kumasi was the *ne plus ultra* both for those who came from the north and those who came from the south; and so great was the dread of Ashanti among the neighbouring tribes, that I found in 1868, when I contemplated exploration from the Gold Coast and inspected the ground, it would be impossible to pass into the interior by any route between the Asini and the Volta without being arrested and sent to Kumasi. This cordon is now broken up, and it is probable that before very long the Germans and other tribes at the back of Ashanti will find their way down to the Coast.

I am afraid our local Government here are neglecting one of the most important measures in this affair of the Ashantee war. No blockade can be effectual till it is carried out fully. Although Government has blockaded our frontiers toward the Ashantee territory, yet this part of the country, on the river Volta, is totally neglected, and now open to the Ashantees, where they receive all the munitions of war. In consequence of this, a vigorous trade is going on from this and Adda and Quittah, in salt, tobacco, gin, arms, and gunpowder, in exchange for gold dust and slaves. This is a policy that we stupid people here don't understand. Through this neglect the Ashantees have lately committed some outrages here.\n\nSome time last month the messengers of the King of Ashantee arrived here in the town of Assabi, in the district of Krepee, and under cover of night cut off the heads of two of Her Majesty's subjects, by names Quamlin Savili and Kuaku Dabonnie, natives of Assabi, in our Krepee jurisdiction.\n\nIt has since come out that this outrage was committed by sanction and connivance of the chief of Assabi, by name Quamlin Minta, who is supposed to be intriguing with the Ashantees. On investigating the case before the supreme chief, Nijarkon, it was further proved that Minta has had a criminal connexion with the wife of one of the unfortunate men. He is now bailed out before Chief Nijarkon till something is heard from proper authorities.

The countries on the sea-coast are divided into districts, to each of which a Commissioner is appointed by the Governor. The interior countries, however, are not thus provided for, but are left to be ruled by their chiefs and kings, as formerly. The authority of these kings and chiefs was not formally acknowledged, and any offence which, according to custom, is visited with severe punishment, is immediately reported to the Government authorities on the sea-coast; and the chieftain or king who ordered the punishment is brought before the Court and treated as the commonest fellow.\n\nThis action on the part of the Government terrifies and paralyzes a good many of these chiefs and kings, so that in a great many instances the wicked go unpunished. On the other hand, others use the name of the Government to acquire territories which they have not the least right to. Amongst these I may mention the name of one ""Sakiaty,"" who is of great notoriety in Eastern Croboe, interior of Accra. This man was a chief of Odumase, a country of Eastern Croboe, before the Ashanti Campaign, but immediately after the war, he assumed the authority and title of king, which he said was vested in him by Sir John Glover for the valuable services he rendered in the war. Not contented with the throne which he has thus usurped, he is now intriguing to acquire Western Croboe also. The present king of Western Croboe, who is now being molested, forbears to say anything, lest his opposition may end in a contest, and he may be thereby brought to the sea-coast and treated with ignominy. But there is sure to come a successor who will dispute every inch of ground that ""Sakiaty"" has thus acquired. This will undoubtedly end in strife, when people will have the mortification again to see that their royalties are treated contemptuously by those who are their protectors. If the present system of government in the interior countries is to continue, I would, Sir, respectfully recommend that the following plans be carried out: (1) that every chieftain or king in the interior should prove his claim; (2) that the right of government by native chiefs and kings in the interior, so far as it is compatible with common sense and humanity, be proclaimed as supported by the British authorities on the sea-coast; and (3), that any unnecessary interference and aggression of one chief or king with another, be met with the highest displeasure of the Governor.', 'last_edit_date': '1880-06-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_08_1880#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'DEATH OF THE KING OF ASHANTI.—BRUTAL SLAUGHTER OF 300 VICTIMS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A letter received from Ashanti, by last mail, represents that country as being in a disturbed state, owing to the deaths of the King and his well-known predecessor, Koffee Kalkalli.

A few more sunrises and sunsets, and before these lines come beneath the eyes of our readers, a year of rare fertility in expectations, and rich in its harvest of results, will have descended, with its ineffaceable records, into the great mundane catacombs of perished time. In our retrospect, it is not alone from a West African point of view that we have to regard—we have to look also from a Christian and an Imperial one; and from one and all we find cause of rejoicing and of praise. When writing in December, 1873, we had before us the fact of almost matured preparations on the Gold Coast for a march into Ashanti, within the territory of which all that remained of a late invading army had withdrawn. The Prah was to be crossed on the first days of the new year, provided the important question of supplies for the advancing army could be satisfactorily solved. Haters of war, we, for that very reason, desired with all our heart that the advance might be made. We had not any of those fears which beset the minds of some of our eminent public men. With us it was a foregone conclusion that if the army could, and was allowed to, advance, there was no enemy, however naturally brave, that could successfully withstand it—there were no obstacles that it could not overcome—there was no resisting power that could survive the British hostile impact. There was, perhaps, a slight tinge of fear on our thoughts that temporary political considerations might triumph over Imperial and West African interests—that some overtures might be made by the enemy, and fatally accepted, with a view to the announcement at the meeting of the Imperial Parliament that the Gold Coast operations had successfully terminated, and our forces were on their homeward march. The tinge, however, was but slight and transient. We had faith in the ignorant obstinacy of the Ashantees; and that faith was fully justified. The enemy slipped away from all the encouragements offered him to propose or accept suitable terms of accommodation. The British forces, with their few dependable and effective African allies, advanced, fought, conquered, and took and burnt Kumasi. The Ashanti power was thenceforth at an end, as we had always felt convinced that it would be. The King thought to free himself from his difficulties and recover his lost prestige by sundry diplomatic wrigglings; but the fatal word of High Heaven's decree, had been traced on the smouldering ruins of his hideously blood-stained capital, and no earthly power nor earthly blunder could efface or revoke it. As M. Bonnat, the French prisoner of three or four years at Kumasi, has very justly and correctly expressed it, the Ashantees, according to African ideas and customs, now considered that they belonged to the conqueror. He had overcome them; they were henceforth his, and their only wonder would be his declining to avail himself to the fullest extent of his rights by conquest. That the conqueror has not yet done so, we deplore; that he will yet find it necessary, and be therefore compelled to do so, we do not hesitate to affirm. Ashanti—all the combined and tributary states and kingdoms known under that name, from the Prah to the summits of the Kong Mountains and to the frontier of Dahomey—belongs, according to all native African precedent and ideas, to Great Britain; and she may effectively possess, rule, and govern it whenever it may seem good in her eyes for her to do so. As Great Britain has declined for the present to interfere among the lately combined kings and tributaries, further than to advise them to be at peace one with another, they have, according to our this month's advices, deposed their King, Koffee Kalkalli, who has submitted to a decree he had not the power to resist. They are now endeavouring to form combinations for a new general organization; but any such organization in native Africa, that has no power to surround itself with the prestige of great military success, is but a rope of sand. We scarcely need say that if we could have our will, Great Britain would not confine herself to the mere rôle of unimpassioned observer and occasional adviser at so important a time as the present. She has the power to shape the future course and rule the future destinies of those countries. Unsought, unwished for, God has given them into her hand; and it is her duty to fulfil the trust thus confided to her. While that issue was being fought out in Ashanti, a series of unexpected occurrences led to a change of the occupants of political power in Great Britain. The Government who had made the Ashanti War had passed away in their hour of victory, and Lord Kimberley was succeeded by Lord Carnarvon. The Gold Coast War had brought into prominence many facts before unknown or disregarded, or wilfully ignored; and the new Ministry comprehended that West African affairs, after such Imperial sacrifices as had been made in the late war, could no longer be allowed to drift as they had heretofore done, no one knowing or caring whither. Since it was determined that we could not cease to occupy, it was also determined that we must govern, and must have some distinct and comprehensible policy.

The news he brings is truly distressing. Quacoe Duah, the aged King of that extraordinary country, is really dead. He died suddenly, and was found dead in his bed on the 27th April, 1867. No one knew of the king's death but the principal Ocrah in the palace, and as the principal chiefs went to pay their accustomed respects to their sovereign they were all seized, the door locked, and everyone was slaughtered there and then to accompany the king to the other world. Of course this was a grand signal for the commencement of the decapitation, and for weeks on an average there were forty human beings killed per day.\n\nThe Princes of Ashantee went about shooting, stabbing, and otherwise butchering any one they met in the streets or in houses. I am happy, however, to say that Prince Ansah assured me he did not imbrue his hands in human blood, although he could if he had liked, and in fact he was expected to do his share, but he wisely and creditably declined the honour, and in giving me a history of the fearful doings at Ashantee, he appeared to be as horrified as I was at the barbarities he was forced to gaze on. Two instances of great devotion were displayed by two of the late king's wives; they followed the procession to the grave, and as their lord the king was placed in his sepulchre, they drank bowls of poison and threw themselves alongside of him. The rest of his wives were decapitated by force. The prince informs me that the stench in Kumasi was dreadful, and he was glad to get away from the horrors that surrounded him. The King Quacoe Duah had reigned thirty-seven years, the longest reign known in Ashantee.

Culturally and economically, the Egba and Egbado areas were also intensely penetrated by the Oyo: there were Oyo settler colonies and Oyo traders actively engaged in commercial activities in the area.$^{8}$ Ketu and Sabe, two other major Yoruba sub-groups and states in the west, preserved traditions of political autonomy, but they also maintained cordial relations with Oyo and benefited from the overall protective influence of the empire.

Cutting across the lineage system of non-centralized societies, a variety of integrative institutions developed in the religious, judicial and economic fields which could function as an overall framework of order or replace a disintegrating state-system.$^{25}$ The poro and similar associations in Upper Guinea, or various so-called 'secret societies' in the Cross river and equatorial forest areas of the Cameroons and Gabon are examples.

Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The western and southern Volta plateaux', 'content': 'In this region, lineage groups and clans that for the most part lacked centralized power stood up rather well to the upheavals of the time.

Yet, the ideas and institutions upon which Womunafu's authority was based were extensively shared by the political capitals nearby.$^{32}$ In Bushu, in the western part of the region, the competition between religious and political bases of authority was, to a considerable extent, resolved in the nineteenth century through the integration of opposed elements into a collection of ritual chiefships.$^{33}$ In Rwanda, in Bunyoro, and in south-western presentday Uganda, kubandwa ideas and organization had long provided complexes of opposition to the authority of political capitals, a critically important plane opposed to the principles and activities of the state and from which the penetration of the state was substantially excluded. At times, kubandwa organizations were sufficiently strong to challenge and overthrow existing political authority. In the nineteenth century, perhaps the most substantial of all known kubandwa movements focused on the female deity Nyabingi. The Nyabingi movement emerged in opposition to the Rwanda state, which was formalizing its influence beyond the old administrative region in the Rwanda centre, particularly extending to the north and to the west. In the present-day Zaire-Uganda borderland, in Kigezi, and in parts of Nkore, followers of Nyabingi organized resistance to the extension of the Rwanda state into their worlds. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, Nyabingi became a focus of resistance to political authority more generally and to European colonial activity as it was felt by peoples of the region. 34"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Niger delta > The eastern delta', 'content': 'The Ijo groups in the eastern delta developed state institutions based on a number of cities or population centres, such as Nembe, Bonny, Elem Kalahari, and Okrika.$^{4}$ These states, named city-states by K.

Elsewhere, states broke up according to various pat› terns: some states, which had been centralized, split into groupings of chiefdoms, informally united but subject to no common centre; others became even more decentralized, with a tendency in some cases towards the disappearance of the power of the chiefs.\nThe region to the south of the Ovimbundu highlands in Angola falls into the category of groupings of large chiefdoms. The dominant cultural group on the plateau, broadly termed the Nyanyeka-Nkhumbi, consisted of several ethnic groups: Nyanyeka, Otyilenge, Nkhumbi, etc. In the nineteenth century, some of the chiefdoms in the region were, in fact, the remains of former kingdoms. One such was Mwila, a Nyanyeka kingdom, which dominated the entire Huila region in the eighteenth century and broke up towards the middle of the nineteenth century with the succession of Jau, which soon disintegrated in its turn. In the eighteenth century Mwila had entered into contact with Caconda and Portuguese Angola. It was the most densely populated part of the Nyanyeka land, and the scene of repeated Portuguese attempts to establish white settlers there in the 1840s, at the cost of many military confrontations. The Nyanyeka chief› doms, especially Mwila, and later Ngambwe, became trading centres for wax, ivory and livestock, supplying the whole of southern Angola in the second half of the nineteenth century. Although trade itself contributed to the political break-up of the region, raids and plundering expeditions often favoured the swift rise to power of adventurers or newcomers. From the 1840s onwards, traders and petty warlords, often armed, scoured the entire region, carving out territories of their own and establishing strongholds for their following of captives (servicais), refugees and adventurers, where man and beast took refuge from violence behind thorn palisades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Cameroon coast and its hinterland 14 > The Ogowe basin and surrounding regions 23', 'content': 'These Bantu-speaking peoples had by the nineteenth century formed a large number of political entities of varying sizes: village-states (Fang, Kele, Seke, Benga); confederations (Mpongwe, Gisir, Punu, Obamba); and kingdoms (Nkomi, Orungu, Galwa from i860 on).$^{24}$ Within these political entities, the different peoples engaged in a range of activities, nomadic agriculture, hunting, fishing and crafts. These crafts were distinguished above all by the quality of the goods produced, as for example the ironware manufactured by the Fang, who were considered by European travellers in the nineteenth century to be the best ironsmiths of the region, and the fabrics woven by the peoples of the Upper Ngunyi (Gisir, Apindji and Mitsogo in particular). The products of these economic activities served as the basis for extensive trading among the different communities. For example, a vigorous trade in cassava flour and dried fish was carried on between the Mpongwe confederation, in the Como estuary, and the Orungu kingdom in the Ogowe delta; the famous bongo cloth produced by the weavers in the hinterland was transported from the upper Ngunyi to the coast by way of the Ogowe and the Rembo-Nkomi; finally, from the Atlantic seaboard convoys laden with bales of locally produced salt set out regularly for the interior. After the arrival of the Portuguese on the coast in 1471, trading was intensified to the point of becoming the main activity of the coastal peoples in the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, cheap European goods - guns, alcoholic beverages, fabrics, cheap glassware, trinkets - being bartered for slaves, ivory, palm oil, rubber, ebony and redwood.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Peoples and states of the Great Lakes region', 'section_title': 'The political order', 'content': ""The second trend was the decisive expansion of power of three or four states - Buganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and eventually, Bunyoro, during its period of revival - at the expense of other states. These two trends were closely intertwined. The success of these four major kingdoms during the nineteenth century rested upon the reorganization of administration towards stronger central control, the quelling of long-persistent civil strife by the elimination of opposition and by the extroversion of internal conflicts through expansionary and tribute-gathering campaigns, the enlargement of domains through conquests of new areas, the capture and incorporation of sections of regional production and trade, and the integration of new elements and forces entering the wider region.\nA signal of this wholesale change in these major domains from the eighteenth to the nineteenth century is noted in looking at the duration of reign-length of the nineteenth-century rulers of Buganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and Bunyoro. In Buganda, Kamanya ruled thirty to thirty-five years, beginning in the first years of the century. Suna followed Kamanya and ruled twenty years. Mutesa followed Suna and ruled twenty-eight years. By comparison, eleven kabakas ruled Buganda in the eighteenth century and a considerable proportion of these eleven were murdered or removed from office. An eighteenth-century 'era of princes' had been transformed into an 'era of long reigns', and Kamanya, Suna, and Mutesa each had the breathing space to organize an initial control, to limit oppo› sition from contending princes and factions, and move to expand the resources of the state.\nIn Rwanda, a similar 'era of long reigns' supplanted a pattern of abbrevi› ated tenure in the previous era.

He points to the complicity between Ibadan and Dahomey, the objects of which were happily defeated by the overwhelming repulse of the latter before Abeokuta; and regards the late efforts of Ibadan to form a road to Port Novo through the Egba farms, as evidence of persistence in the same policy. As regards fighting power we think he gives abundant evidence that the Egbas are quite equal to the Ibadans. What then? Is it to be a combat à la mort between the two peoples?

At present the authorities there have no intention to grant any favour to the prejudice of British interests; but I think something more should be done to attach the natives of the interior to our Government. Whether deserved or not we have a reputation of being slow and supine. The Egbas (the people of Abeokuta) are sometimes tempted to act unpleasantly towards us. There is a disaffected section in the community, by whom the loyal chiefs are occasionally harassed. On the occasion of my last visit to Abeokuta, last April, intelligence had arrived respecting the Dahomian attack on Porto Novo. It was currently reported that the English had secretly connived with the Dahomians, and an attempt was made to raise an ante-English demonstration. On April 7 important deliberations were conducted by the authorities. Ebullitions of anger were here and there displayed, and an attack was expected. However, the cloud passed off, and the ground of this suspicion appeared to be that an influential Dahomian prince had been for some weeks residing in Lagos. On this occasion I was returning from a tour through the Yaruba country. The region through which I travelled was in a state of great unrest. At Jubu Ode the King and chiefs expressed their vexation over the interminable Ibadan and Ilorin, which are sadly interfering with trade. The Ibadans, while prolonging their strife with Ilorin, are also troubled with the Egbas raiding their farms. The relations between Ibadan and Oyo are in a condition of extreme tension. At Ogbomosho complaints were loud on account of the spoliation of their farms by the Ilorians, with kidnapping and occasional slaughter. Within the last few years thirteen Yaruba towns have been destroyed by the Dahomians, and seven towns were destroyed last year. From what I can gather these towns have about 4,000 inhabitants, while several were much larger. In my journey I passed through the ruins of some of the towns which, a few years ago, were large and influential centres of population and commerce, notably Ijayi and Biolorun Pellu. It would be an unspeakable mercy if some benevolent civilised Power could interfere to cause the chronic strife to cease, and develop the riches of the country. After getting some fifty or sixty miles from the coast the country is comparatively healthy and fertile, as the plantations of cotton, indigo, &c., show, and in some parts rich in mineral treasure. I saw several iron pits and smelting furnaces, and have specimens of iron ore by me. I availed myself of the opportunities afforded me in interviews with kings and chiefs to urge on them the necessity of peace and industry, and was received with welcome wherever I went in the Yaruba country. The reply of one chief was remarkable. He said, “You tell us how much we should be advantaged if we would abandon our quarrels and unite for strength and prosperity. Your words are true; but we are like children fighting.

At last the efforts made have been crowned with success. The contending factions were grouped into two opposing sides. On the one side were the Ibadans, a powerful tribe situated right in the centre of the region of the war, and, therefore, surrounded by enemies; and on the other was a confederation of tribes under the general name of the Ekitiparapos. Man-catching was the real object of the war, and herein lay the great difficulty in the way of mediation; for it was obvious that none of the man-catching tribes would surrender their main source of revenue without a struggle. However, with the aid of two educated natives, a treaty of peace was signed in July, 1886, and ratified in the following September.\n\nThe first circumstance which opened up a prospect of successful mediation was an intimation received by Administrator Moloney, at Lagos, of a quarrel between the King of the Sebus and his people, the former wanting to continue the war and the latter to end it. It was not till long afterwards that Sir Samuel Rowe felt he was justified in interfering. His first attempt was not encouraging, but ultimately the Kings of the Ekitiparapos confederacy, twenty-six in number, appealed to the Governor, stating their grievances against the Ibadans, and asking him to prevent their being supplied with ammunition from Lagos through the agency of an Ibadan there.\n\nThe answer came from Mr. Moloney, who had assumed the government of the colony, and he addressed it to all the belligerents, rating them soundly for continuing the war, and offering his services as mediator. The replies were favourable. An armistice was arranged, and conferences were held. Statements setting forth the case for each tribe separately were forwarded to the Governor. In one of them (from the commander of the Jebus) the following passage occurs: ""Ile Ife is regarded by all our nation as the sacred spot from which we originated, and the Oni is respected as the father of all the Kings. This is why the Jebu King felt it his duty to reinstate the Ifes in the town. It was from Ile Ife that his father went to settle in the Jebu country.

The Ilorins, who are Mahommedans, are a warlike and powerful people, and have a force of some 800 cavalry. They are also believed to possess a considerable number of Sniders. It is felt in some quarters that if these people persist in their present hostile attitude it may be necessary to discuss the question of an expedition to Ilorin. The following will explain the present position of affairs and account for the hostility of the Ilorins: For the purpose of preserving peace and keeping open the trade routes it was found necessary to establish an armed post at Ibadan, about 80 miles from Lagos. This was done with the consent of the Ibadans, who at the same time promised to afford every facility for the railroad to be carried into their town from Lagos. Shortly afterwards a force of 100 Houssas, with a seven-pounder and a Maxim, was placed at Ibadan under Captain Bower, as Resident, and a constabulary officer. A small fort was also established. Later the question of the Ilorin-Ibadan frontier arose. Up to that time the Ilorins had declined to accede to the boundary demanded by the Ibadans—a demand which was quite just and fair—that a line should be drawn to the north of Odo Otin as a boundary between the two tribes. Consequently, in order to protect the Ibadans and to safeguard British interests, an outpost of fifty men, with a Maxim and a seven-pounder, was placed at Odo Otin, and a small fort was built. Odo Otin is about four and a-half days\' march from Ibadan, and is within the Lagos sphere. It is right on the borders of the Ilorin country, and was chosen for the purpose of overawing the people there. After the establishment of this post the Ilorins were friendly to the Lagos Government, but later messengers sent by the Commissioner from Ibadan were sent back with word that the Ilorins would have nothing to do with the white man at all. Since then they have given considerable trouble both to the Lagos authorities and the Niger Company. The attacks just announced were doubtless the outcome of a recent resolution which resulted in the overthrow of the Emir of Ilorin. As a result of the latter\'s want of success he, in the usual African manner, was told to ""go to sleep."" He shut himself up in his house together with his slaves, ignited the powder magazine on the premises, and the whole party were blown to atoms. This Emir had been very friendly to the British, but the present ruler is under the influence of Adamu—a powerful war chief—and is very hostile. Since his accession until the attack on Odo Otin of March 31, this chief has pursued a policy of masterly inactivity rather than one of active aggression. He refused to hold any intercourse with the British, and even threatened to kill any messenger from the British authorities. Now it seems, although no details of the attack are to hand, that he has embarked on a more active policy. Doubtless this matter will be best dealt with by the joint action of the Lagos Government and the Niger Company, for Ilorin is in the company\'s sphere, and the Emir is subsidised by the company. The chief town is about four days\' march from the Niger, and half that distance from the outposts of the Lagos Government. Meantime, news from Lagos states that the railway work in the Colony is progressing. An iron bridge is now being constructed which will connect Lagos Island with the mainland, and the first section of the railway from Ebute Metta to Otta has been commenced. The ultimate destination of this line is Ibadan, and it is pointed out that the progress of such a work will do much to restore order in the hinterland. The line will, in all probability, go to Ibadan, via Abeokuta—the chief town of the Egbas—who have expressed their willingness that the railway should go through their country.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1896#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Regrettable Incident at Jebu Ode', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Much surprise and indignation was created at Lagos, about the middle of December, by the receipt of intelligence that the King of Jebu Ode was in the town seeking an asylum from the soldiers of the Colonial Government.

While much dissatisfaction appear to have existed on account of the violation by a female convert at Muslim of a Native custom held in much reverence by the people, yet it is evident that the assault upon the Awujale and Chiefs, which led to their withdrawal from their country, was more the result of curiosity on the part of Inspector-General Mitchell to see the king, than any apprehension of a rebellious rising. Having arrived at Jebu Ode one evening, the Inspector-General desired to see the king, who was accordingly sent for. The king not having turned up, and the Inspector being anxious to continue his journey to Odo Otiou early next morning, he, as soon as it was light, despatched a force of Houssas to fetch the king. This order appears to have been executed without due regard to the feelings and traditions of the Awujale and his people, who naturally resented this unprovoked display of violence, and rushed to the Residency to see what had befallen the king. And here Inspector-General Mitchell again had recourse to the Houssas who beat back the people with the butts of their rifles. The fact that the Inspector-General was able to proceed on his journey with his force of Houssas without detaching any for special service at Jebu Ode, disposes of the presumption as to any anticipated rising on the part of the Natives. The only comment to be offered upon conduct entailing such serious consequences is, that in the ordinary relations of life the display of such indiscretion by one in authority would be taken as an indication of incapacity. The incident serves to show how difficult it is for tranquillity to be assured in the Interior under the present military regime, and the merchants who are so greatly concerned in the peaceful development of the country, are likely to be roused by the incident to an effort for the withdrawal of a system which must always be productive of trouble and discontent. Mr. Commissioner Rohrweger has defined very clearly the position of the British officer in the Hinterland, by investing the power of government with the Awujale. The office and duty of the British Resident is to uphold the authority of the Native rulers, taking care at the same time that the principles of humanity are not violated. It is desirable that there should be a recognised medium of communication between the British officer and the Native King and Chiefs, and this office should be held by an officer of experience and position. The message sent to the Awujale, which caused all the trouble, appears to have been carried by an ordinary labourer, and shows how irregularly such messages are sent. It is indispensable in the interest of peace and order in the Interior that the authority of the Native rulers should be recognised and respected by all, and her Majesty's officers should make it their duty to ensure effective respect being paid to this authority. Otherwise, the boasted European civilisation will be worse than a farce in the eyes of the Natives."", 'last_edit_date': '1897-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1897#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.619, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the present time, from all parts of the West African coast, we have reports of troubles and disturbances, which must hamper trade and retard the commercial and civilising development of that part of the Dark Continent.

From the boundary of their territory to the town of Abeokuta the distance is, as the crow flies, about 85 miles of land, which is inhabited by the Yoruba tribes of the Ketus and Egbados. Towards the south lies the territory of Porto Novo, Ado, Ota, Badagry; the whole extending north to south about 45 miles. This gives an area of about 3,000 square miles of land inhabited by industrious farm labourers; it is the region from which we draw our supply of animal and vegetable provisions, the country which to a large degree supplies the trade of Lagos; the Ijebu country in the east being as yet only open on its coast line. Now what is the result of the annual inroads of the Dahomeyans into this territory? Let it be understood that the inhabitants of these 3,000 square miles do not, for one-third of the year, feel themselves safe from attack, and that this third of the year is the most important part of the year to the farmers—the planting time. It has happened during the last few years that the poor farmers have been lingering about their farms preparing them for the planting of yams, Indian corn, and other things, when the enemy has fallen upon them and carried them away, so that the authorities of Abeokuta have now forbidden them to remain in their farm-villages during this season of danger. But what is the consequence of all this? People fear the breaking out of famine in Abeokuta—a large town inhabited by 100,000 farmers. What an anomaly in a country so thinly populated, and deprived, as it has been so largely, of its able-bodied labourers, by a century of the slave-trade, and yet so it is. This very year the Dahomeyan hordes hunted the country up and down, making towns and villages unsafe, kidnapping on a large scale—refugees from Ota came even here to Lagos—until they finally pounced upon two villages in the Ketu country, which they completely sacked, and returned loaded with plunder. Under such circumstances, how can trade flourish, when people are unable to obtain the necessaries of life, and when their town is threatened with famine? It is but little likely that he who is in anxiety about the needful harvest will take much trouble to gather in palm-nuts, which ripen during the same first four months of the year, or to gather in the cotton which at the same time whitens his fields. Both must rot or be destroyed by birds and insects. It is not easy to imagine how great the amount of produce would be that might be obtained from this extensive region if those yearly raids were put a stop to. One strange feature in the case is, that this happens so near to Lagos—only some twenty miles from the lagoon, which is navigable nearly the whole of the before-mentioned eighty-five miles of territory. The loss arising from these raids is not by any means confined to the people who are the first to suffer; but the trade of Lagos, whether as regards that done in the direction of Abeokuta, Badagry, or Porto Novo, suffers most seriously. It is to be hoped that England will not overlook this matter when the time for settlement with the King of Dahomey comes.

The protectorate, announced at Bonny, in December last, by Admiral Sir Walter Hunt Grubb, extends from the right bank of Benin river to the Rio del Rey, thus including Brass, New and Old Calabar, Bonny, Opobo, and other important trading stations.\n\nTwo series of considerations, the internal and external, have combined to render action imperative, and a retrospective view may not be uninstructive. Since the abolition of the export of slaves, these localities have been the sites of trading stations, palm oil being the chief article of export. The traders have been, with few exceptions, British, and the capitalists mostly Liverpool merchants. The natives allowed trading hulks to be anchored and commerce conducted on payment of fixed sums, known as ""comey."" Bonny, Brass, and Old Calabar are among the oldest of these trading ports, the native chiefs being also the native traders. They possessed numerous slaves who were sent with merchandise to the interior markets to collect oil, which was brought to the stations and sold to the whites. Among the Bonny chiefs was the father of Ja Ja, late King of Opobo; his son was brought up to the management of the business, and on his father\'s death he succeeded to his position. Of his enemies the most powerful was Oko Jumbo, who lost no opportunity to humiliate him. The Europeans could only let matters take their course; they regretted constant fighting of Oko Jumbo and Ja Ja, but the relations between the Europeans and natives being strictly commercial, nothing could be done. Suffering reverses, Ja Ja was forced to fly with the remnant of his people after great slaughter at the hands of Oko Jumbo. He collected his scattered family, dependants, and slaves, and made his escape to the Opobo river.

Ja Ja, whose name is well known as that of the successful rebel chief who some years ago, in conjunction with his party, retired to this place, where, being nearer to the palm oil producing markets, and commanding all the creeks from Bonny river leading thereto, with the aid of two mercantile houses whom he induced to support him, he eventually obtained terms which gave him an ascendancy over his opponents, and secured to this river the larger portion of the trade which had previously been carried on in Bonny alone. His position here is now one of great power, and his will is law. He possesses a number of Krupp and other guns, both breech and muzzle loading, and is well supplied with Snider and other breech-loading rifles. There are some half-dozen British commercial houses established here doing business with him and his people, who act as intermediate agents between them and the producers of the staple article of commerce—palm oil. He prohibits all intercourse between the Europeans and the producers, although they are but a few miles apart, enjoying thereby a monopoly by which he is enabled to build up his power, which he at times exercises in the most arbitrary manner towards both natives and Europeans. Of the latter he allows only such as he chooses to engage in trade with his people, and if those established incur his displeasure he prohibits their trading (through the influence he possesses over his own people) until they enforce obedience to his views. About half way between Opobo and the Old Calabar rivers runs the river Qua Ebo, in which a Scotch house formerly did business. A house trading in Old Calabar recently determined to open trade in the Qua Ebo, and entered into negotiations with the principal natives there, who allotted a site near the mouth of the river for the purpose of building a factory, which has since been erected and preparations made for opening trade with them. Ja Ja, hearing of this, sent messengers with presents to the Qua Ebo people, requesting them to trade with him rather than with the European house. These presents were not accepted by the natives, who stated their desire to do business with white men, as they had previously done. It must be remembered that these people owe no allegiance to Ja Ja, and in his treaties with the British Government he has no recognised authority over this part of the coast. The natives of the Qua Ebo have a river of their own quite distinct from the Opobo. The land about it is comparatively high, and the whole country is covered with palm-trees, so that they are able both to produce the oil themselves and to act as intermediary agents between the European merchant and the natives dwelling higher up their river and creeks. Having little or no trade they are a poor defenseless people, completely at the mercy of men armed with modern artillery and firearms. Ja Ja, without any warning, sent his headmen with some fifty canoes, full of men armed to the teeth, and, dragging them over the flats which separate the creeks of the two rivers, they suddenly pounced upon the unprotected dwellers on the banks of the Qua Ebo, who, innocent of any cause of offence, and unprepared for any attack, were dismayed to find themselves the object of Ja Ja's wrath and fiery vengeance. Early in the morning of the 11th April the havoc began, and the poor wretches, having no means of defence, were either shot down or saved their lives by immediate flight into the woods. Their enemies burnt down their towns, destroyed their farms, and seized all their cattle, and whatever else they could lay their hands on and carry away. Seven villages were thus attacked and destroyed, and the people, scattered and homeless, roamed about the woods for days without food, not daring to venture near the river lest their merciless persecutors might still be in the neighbourhood. Ja Ja's people went to the recently-built factory and vented their rage upon it to the extent of bursting open the door, and scattering the few things inside, but the person in charge (an old Calabar native there temporarily) had prudently taken his departure at the commencement of the firing, rightly concluding the raiders were equally his enemies. The victorious conquerors of a people without arms, after firing and looting the towns, returned with their booty to the Opobo, taking along with them 100 men, women, and children, whom they had caught. These unfortunate creatures they most barbarously slaughtered in cold blood, under circumstances of the most revolting cruelty. Their heads and limbs were seen afterwards about Opobo town, in which a horrible sickening stench, arising from the uncooked remains of the slaughtered prisoners, poisoned the air for days, no attempt being made to hide the evidences of their horrid deeds from the Europeans who had occasion to enter the town and who had appealed in vain to Ja Ja to spare them. But it is a proof of his arbitrary power, and of their weakness or fear of opposing his and his people's barbarity, that their influence extended only to the salvation of a few young girls. Women are the chief property of the savage African, and, seeing that their cupidity overcame their ferocity in the saving of these girls, it is greatly to be regretted that the Europeans did not unite to attempt the ransom of the lives of the others. If an African wants to create a quarrel or commit a crime he has never any difficulty in finding an excuse for it. Ja Ja gives as a reason for this execrable deed that some years ago the Qua Ebo people killed one of his men, but anyone who knows his cunning treachery and ferocity will know also that such an outrage by such people would not have been allowed by him to remain for years unsettled, and that he only brings it\n**77**"", 'last_edit_date': '1881-05-06', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1881#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.607, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ENGLISH CIVILISATION IN THE NIGER REGION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""And what impression has your tour made?""—""We have returned well satisfied with the work of administration and also with the commercial development which is going on.

Dissatisfied with his small chieftainship, and burning for extended power and wealth, he determined to wrest the country of Urori from the hands of the powerful chief Merere. He had acquired despotic power among his subjects, and they were ready to follow wherever he led. Thus commanded, the Wahehé crossed their southern border-line and attacked the Warori or Wasango. In every engagement they were victorious. Villages were burned and cattle seized, and like an irresistible wave they swept across the plateau, devastating the entire country. Merere, unable to defend his immense town, burned it to prevent its falling into the hands of the Wahehé, drove off his princely herds of cattle, and took refuge in the higher mountainous plateau which surrounds the north end of Lake Nyassa. Here he formed a strong stockade by the side of the Ruaha, and bade defiance to the Wahehé. At this juncture Captain Elton and party on their way from Nyassa to the coast reached the seat of war, and were smuggled secretly into the stockade, where they found the besieged in sore straits for want of food. Their presence and their guns, however, gave Merere renewed courage, and finally the Wahehé retired disorganised and broken. Immediately after this defeat an under-chief, called Mamlé, formed a conspiracy against Machinga, encouraged doubtless by the reverse which the chief had sustained. Being sure of a section of the tribe, he murdered Machinga and seized the chieftainship, informing the latter's son that he was but a boy, and not able to wield his father's sword. A part of the tribe, still faithful to the rightful heir, but too weak to resist, decamped during the night, and returned to their original country, north of the Ruaha, where they again established themselves under Machinga's son, Mamlé, now chief of the more important section of the tribe, and once more took up arms against Merere. In every engagement the latter was beaten, till at last, unable to keep a footing in his own country, the great chief of all Urori, Usango, and Ubena was compelled to flee into Usafa, and Mamlé reigned supreme from Mpwapwa and Ugogo to Lake Nyassa.

There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority.

In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British.

Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The most important and most discussed African component was the local chief. Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""In theory such indirect administration also applied to French colonial activities south of the Sahara, but in fact practice was at severe variance with it. In a statement frequently referred to as most descriptive of the methods which the French actually pursued in this region between the wars, the Governor-General of French West Africa, Joost Van Vollenhoven, remarked in 1917: The chiefs 'have no power of their own, for there are not two authorities in the cercle ... ; there is only one! Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained. Most obviously, traditional functions were distended by new demands, such as the collection of taxes, the taking of censuses, or the recruitment of labour and military conscripts. Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The colonial regimes were no exception to the truism that every ad› ministration makes use of intermediary structures, largely for reasons of economy and effectiveness.

Indeed, in the search for such authority structures and personnel, the colonial officials often created new ones which they could understand and use. Such were the 'warrant chiefs' of South-eastern Nigeria, the native authorities among the Maasai in Tanganyika (now Tanzania), and in parts of Uganda outside Buganda, and most of the so-called chiefs (chefs de paille) under the French, Belgians and the Portuguese.

Alfred Saker and the Rev. George Grenfell, late missionaries, who were at Akwa Town, address to the Baptist Missionary Society concerning Bell Town and Akwa Town, Cameroons. There are millions and millions of Europeans who have never heard of this country, but still there are many who have heard of it and its towns, but don't know the State and tribes of the Cameroons. Permit me, therefore, to say something about them to you to-day, because God has appointed you as an instrument to check ungodly dealings in Africa. The Cameroons are governed by two kings—King Bell and King Akwa. The people of Bell Town are under King Bell's control, and the people of Akwa Town are under King Akwa's control. Each town has its own laws too. So, under these circumstances, although they are called Cameroons, there are two distinct peoples. I am sorry to say that King Bell and King Akwa often engage in contention, and the disputes lead them into war. Under these distressing circumstances, King Bell has his own European trading vessel on his beach, and King Akwa has his own trading vessel too; so that if war break out between Bell Town and Akwa Town, each people can go in their own hulk, and buy whatever they want without molestation. So it was as regards the missionaries also. The Rev. Quintin Wilson Thomson was the Bell Town Missionary, and the Rev. Alfred Saker was the Akwa Town Missionary. Mr. Saker was a very good man, and was exceedingly kind to Akwa Town and all the people of Cameroons; by which he was pushing the wheel of civilization and Christianity in Akwa Town. But Mr. Thomson did not the same with the people of Bell Town that Mr. Saker did in Akwa Town. He became a young tyrant at Bell Town. I call him a young tyrant, because he was very cruel to the people of Bell Town, both to the members of his church and the worldly men, and even to the African boys that were living with him. ... The poor members of the Church of Bell Town could not bear to be under such a pastor, so they went to Mr. Saker and told him their trouble. Mr. Saker told them that he was very sorry to hear of their trouble, but that he had no means of assisting them, and they must write to the Baptist Missionary Society in London and tell them of the ill-treatment which they daily received from Mr. Thomson. So the poor people wrote to the Committee, and told them of the ill-treatment and the cruelty which they daily received from their sacred teacher, and that they will not have Mr. Thomson for their missionary any more. The poor members of Bell Town Church did not understand how difficult it is for a society to find a missionary to send to Africa, and there was no one to make them understand. At last the Society granted their request, and wrote to Mr. Thomson to remove from Bell Town. When Mr. Thomson was leaving Bell Town, Mr. Saker told them that they must not be afraid; the Society would send out a missionary for them. But it is now seven years since Mr. Thomson left Bell Town, and no missionary has come out instead of him. The members of Bell Town Church are, therefore, in great want of a European missionary, because it is a very sad thing for a Christian people to live without having one to preach the joyful news of Christ to them. And now, whenever the members of Bell Town Church write to the Committee or the Baptist Missionary Society, they answer them that Mr. Grenfell and Mr. Saker told them that Bell Town is near to Akwa Town, so the members of Bell Town Church must attend the divine service at Akwa Town. But I am sorry to say that Mr. Saker and Mr. Grenfell have not taken a right view of the case Bell Town and Akwa Town are two distinct towns; each town has its own laws and king; so, therefore, each town ought to have her own missionary, because when the members of Bell Town go to Akwa Town to worship, if the worldly men of Akwa Town have been to Bell and quarrelled there, and got flogged by the Bell Town people on account of that quarrel, as soon as the poor members of Bell Town Church come out after the service, the Akwa Town people catch these poor people and give them a sound flogging, as a revenge for the flogging they received at Bell Town. I think it is right, therefore, that the poor people should have their own missionary. Unless the Baptist Missionary Society send out a missionary to Bell Town this year, the chiefs of Bell Town and the Church members intend to write to the Primitive Methodist or Presbyterian Church to send some one to Bell Town who will preach the joyful news of Christ to them. The new missionary of Akwa Town, Rev. D. Lyall, is very kind to the members of Bell Town Church. I often hear that the Baptist Missionary Society say that their labours in Cameroons are not progressing, and that it is thirty-three years since they first sent the Gospel in Cameroons, and that it is not progressing. It is thirty-three years now since the Gospel came in Akwa Town, but not to all Cameroons. Mr. Thomson was the first missionary who settled in Bell Town, and he was four years in Bell Town; so it is only four years since the Gospel sound came to the knowledge of Bell Town's people. The Baptist Missionary Society, therefore, think that they are pushing the wheel of civilization and Christianity in all parts of Cameroons. They are only pushing the wheel in Akwa Town, and they must expect fruits of their labour in Akwa Town alone. The Cameroons field is very large, but the labourers are very few.—I am, Sir, yours, &c.,  \nAN EYE-WITNESS.""}, {'id': 4446, 'article_title': 'The Annexations in Western Africa', 'full_section_title': 'The Annexations in Western Africa', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1882#article-6', 'issue_date': '01_06_1882', 'content': 'on its southern bank, and wandered through the hitherto unexplored land of Tigulinta.

Coffee, maize, rice, olives, almonds, sesame, and caoutchouc trees were found to be abundant and thriving; and Dr. Bayol noted that all the conditions necessary for the cultivation of the sugar-cane were present. The Soudan grape, which has been so much talked of as a substitute for the vines of Southern France, from its supposed freedom from the devastating phylloxera, grows widely in this district. The soil is also rich in minerals, especially copper, while gold and iron are also found.

The correspondent\'s first visit was to Quadjo, an old man nearly ninety years of age, whom he found lying on a bed, with the whole of one side of his body paralyzed. He passed the earlier part of his life in Brazil, and has a great reputation on the coast for integrity and energy; but was so prostrated by illness when the correspondent saw him that he could only point with a melancholy look to his paralyzed side. Quadjovi is only a few months younger than Quadjo, and the correspondent had to wait while he was dressing to receive him. His costume was a toga, a white cap like those worn by women in Europe, and on the top of it a lilac-coloured chimney-pot hat. Notwithstanding this grotesque dress, he looked ""very dignified,"" and addressed some polite questions to his visitor about the health of the Emperor William. In the afternoon the correspondent went to Lawson, who received him in a grey hat, a sky-blue toga, top-boots, and white stockings which reached half-way up his thigh and were held up with garters. He was accompanied by a suite of about thirty negroes, who laughed uproariously when he made a joke. After a brief conversation, which consisted mainly in an exchange of compliments, the correspondent proceeded to Gredji, the residence of the fourth ""king,"" Folli Ajoada. He wore a white toga, a night-cap with a black silk hat on it, and Roman sandals on his bare feet. Although it was nearly sunset, Folli Ajoada ordered a tattered umbrella to be opened and held over his head during the interview, and after it was over he treated his visitor to some bottled beer.'}, {'id': 5172, 'article_title': 'LAGOS NEWS', 'full_section_title': 'LAGOS NEWS', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1885#article-10', 'issue_date': '01_08_1885', 'content': ""The Criminal Assize for June was opened on the 1st of the month, when there were fifteen cases for trial, including one of murder from the district of Leckie.

He was the third son of the late King Gbelegbua, and brother of Princes Adesagu and Enikilaya, and uncle of Adepeyin Otonba (J. A. Payne, Registrar), the son and heir of late Prince Adesagur. The late Prince Ademiyewo succeeded to the throne of Jebu as King Awujale after the death of the late King Enikilaya in 1851, and it was this African potentate who permitted the late ex-King Kosoko of Lagos, his chiefs and people, to reside at Epe on their expulsion from Lagos during the bombardment by Admiral Bruce in December, 1851, on the occasion of the restoration, on his return from exile, of late King Akitoye, the rightful heir to the throne of Lagos. Probably within three months after certain usual ceremonies that are customary on such occasions, one of the native Princes will be asked to succeed to the throne; those that are known at present are Aboki, Adepeyin (so well and honourably known at Lagos as Mr. J. A. Payne), Adeyemi Dele, Ogunaki, and others of the Princes. The Jebu country, by its markets of Ejirin, Ikosi, Ikorodu, Epe, &c., supplies Lagos almost every 8th or 9th day with produce of palm oil, kernels, &c.; its population is about 200,000. The Jebu Government is on friendly terms with the British authority at Lagos.\n\nMr. Josephus Taylor, Chief Clerk at the Colonial Secretariat here, has been appointed Acting District Commissioner of Leckie, _pro tem._, during the absence of Mr. Smith.\n\nA petition from the merchants at Lagos, praying for the separation of Lagos from the Gold Coast and showing reasons, has been forwarded to the Governor for transmission to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.\n\nThe 10th anniversary meeting of the Lagos Native Pastorate Auxiliary Association has been lately held. The English sermon was preached at Christ Church by the Ven. Archdeacon Hamilton on the 8th, and the Yoruba sermon by the Rev. E. Buko, on the 9th of June, at St. Paul's Church. The public meeting, under the presidency of Bishop Crowther, D.D., was held at Breadfruit Schoolroom on the 10th inst. The Rev. James Johnson, the Secretary, read the report, which was a most cheering one. Several speakers addressed the meeting.\n\nIt is rumoured that the wife of the Registrar, Mrs. Payne, and their niece, Miss Victoria Davies, will be leaving by the next mail for Sierra Leone.

The ""music"" ceased, and perfect quietness reigned while the chiefs presented the Prince to Mr. Hopkins as the future King of Old Calabar. This was the signal for a demonstration of the most extraordinary character. The whole company rose _en masse_, shouted, screamed, jumped and yelled as only Africans can, and then the dancing began afresh and became general. The King-elect was attired in a robe of bright-coloured cloth, an admiral\'s worn-out hat, with a white feather sticking in it, covering his head. He carried a silver spear, and a live fowl, tied by the leg to a long string which his majesty held, fluttered on the ground before him. A brush of peacock\'s feathers, some five or six feet long, was suspended from his back to represent a tail. Some of the native costumes were ludicrous in the extreme. Discarded naval and military uniforms were the favourites, on account of their bright colours. Big negroes wore little coats, the sleeves of which did not reach further than their elbows, and they were tied with string in front to draw them close to the body; others again, of small stature, wore large coats, and the result was often that, when the collars were turned up, very little of the wearer\'s inside could be seen. During the progress of the dancing a good deal of commotion and some terror was caused amongst the natives by the sudden appearance of one of the members of a secret society known as ""Egbo men."" This is a society to which at present only two white men are known to belong, all the rest being natives. Its members are selected with very great care, and the main object of the organization is understood to be to obtain justice in their dealings with others. If a member has a transaction with a native, and the latter fails in any momentary obligation he may have incurred, the matter is mentioned before the heads of the society, and the offender is seized and imprisoned until the amount is paid. About eleven o\'clock every night a horn is blown, which sounds all over the town, and on hearing this an ""Egbo man,"" with a bell tied to him, and with a number of followers attending him, starts to scour the whole place, and if anybody, be it man, woman, or child, is found abroad at that hour, they receive prompt punishment, and very often most serious personal injury is thus inflicted. As with secret societies in England, the Egbo men have their strict rules and regulations; the meetings are conducted with closed doors, and each member is sworn not to divulge anything of the proceedings. When the Egbo man referred to appeared at the dance, the upper portion of his body was encased in armour, and his legs were covered with elaborate bead-work; he wore a mask to conceal his features, and had a bunch of feathers behind him as a tail, to which was attached his bell, the sound of which, when he makes his nightly journeys, is so terrifying to the inhabitants. After his disappearance from the scene, the natives resumed their dancing, which was kept up till nightfall, when they all retired to another enclosed space, where the ceremony of burning an effigy of Satan brought the day\'s rejoicings to an end.', 'last_edit_date': '1879-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1879#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.581, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""THE LATE KING M'TESA"", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The King of Uganda, whose death was announced recently, was probably the most notable potentate of purely native origin that the Dark Continent has produced. According to the estimate of Colonel Grant, who was his guest twenty-three years ago, M\'tesa was probably not more than forty-eight years of age at the time of his death, and, having succeeded his father, Suna, in 1857, he has reigned twenty-eight years. The Waganda have the names of thirty-five kings who have reigned down to the time of M\'tesa in regular succession, and this, as Colonel Grant points out, may probably account for the ""blue blood"" and vanity which certainly ran in the veins of M\'tesa. Probably, however, no other native African prince has been able to organize a state so completely and make so great an advance towards civilization as the King who has just died. Colonel Grant, who knew him well, speaks of him in terms of real respect, and his estimate is supported by Sir Samuel Baker and Mr. Stanley. As we know, the result of Mr. Stanley\'s visit was that missions were established in the country, which have had gratifying success. But M\'tesa was much perplexed when he learned that there are two Christian religions, the adherents of which are as hostile to each other as both are to Mahomedanism or heathenism. Doubtless from the European point of view M\'tesa was guilty of great cruelties; but these apparently indiscriminate sacrifices of human life were really the recognized and organized modes of administering justice in Uganda. M\'tesa himself was evidently a man governed largely by impulse. When Baker was all but defeated by the Wanyoro, a force from Uganda arriving in the distance was the cause of the dispersion of the enemy. M\'tesa forwarded letters from Baker to Livingstone by his swift-footed soldiers, who, after a journey of 600 miles, found the veteran traveller was dead. These and other facts show that M\'tesa was capable of taking a real interest in matters far outside the range of the ordinary savage mind. His army, wonderfully organized and disciplined, Mr. Stanley estimates at 125,000 men, and his fleet at 500 canoes. The population of Uganda proper is probably about 1,000,000, but, with neighbouring dependent territories, about 3,000,000. The capital is finely situated on the slopes of the north shore of Lake Victoria Nyanza. It is gratifying to learn that there have been comparatively little violence and bloodshed at the change of monarchy. It used to be the custom at the coronation for a new king to sacrifice his brothers—a custom which the latter evidently regarded as perfectly natural. M\'tesa\'s brothers, at the time of Colonel Grant\'s visit, went about in chains, but all the same, and though conscious of their fate, ""conversed and attended picnics, and boated, and played musical instruments with their brother, the King, with perfect freedom of action and of speech."" What the outside influences have been that have had a civilizing effect on Uganda before it was discovered by Europeans, we do not know; what they have been since, we do know pretty fully, and the results so far have been, on the whole, good. It is to be hoped that under the young Prince who now succeeds, this native state may be allowed to develop itself along its own lines, without any undue attempt to force it into European grooves.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1885#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.588, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Leader', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We are all more or less acquainted with the phrase, ""grandmotherly government,"" and know how much annoyance is caused—and that, too, with but little corresponding advantage—when the Legislature takes upon itself to decide upon minor questions of purely social interest, the solution of which is best left to the individual; but the complaint of the inhabitants of the West African Settlements is not that now and then the Legislature meddles with matters best left to individual judgment, but that the people are altogether suffering from ""over-government."" In dealing with districts and races which have been only partially brought under the influence of European civilization and social custom, there can be no mistake more fatal in its ultimate results than attempting to impose a standard of right and wrong dependent upon principles which the native is altogether incapable of appreciating. And it is, therefore, most refreshing to notice that one of the conditions upon which the Charter recently granted to the National African Company (now the Royal Niger Company) was issued was that ""in the administration of justice regard shall be had to the customs and laws of the nation to which the parties belong."" This is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. It is generally admitted that of all the white officials who within recent years have held appointments on the West Coast of Africa there was not any one so successful in his administration as Governor Maclean. ""He is remembered"" (quoting from a recent number of the *Western Echo*) ""as a perfect adept at everything pertaining to government,"" for with only a very small armed force and a total revenue of less than £4,000 per annum, he managed to maintain peace both within and without the borders of his district. Maclean\'s great influence over the natives was in no small degree attributable to the intimate and appreciative knowledge of the local laws and native customs which he gained during the time he occupied the post of Judicial Assessor, as he found out that among the natives there was a complete and well-understood system of laws connected with both personal property and land, which system, be it remembered, had been handed down, generation after generation, from time immemorial, and was without doubt much better suited to the native understanding than the comparatively modern and elaborate English system of jurisprudence, which, too, is ever varying in its details at least. What is needed to give the native of the West Coast a fair chance of social and domestic improvement, is a frank recognition of his own laws and customs—so far, at least, as they are not repugnant to international law and the best interests of humanity—together with a gradual reduction of the present large and expensive official establishments, and a corresponding lightening of the burdens of taxation, and an assimilation of import and export duties.

It is true that on the last and biggest day of King A.\'s funeral solemnities the young man then called Prince Duke was, in the presence of all the head men of the town, the representatives of the neighbouring districts, and most of the European traders, presented to our late esteemed Consul Hopkins as King-elect of Duke Town; but several of the influential families of the town seemed disposed to contest his claim, and so, at an after convention, a sort of compromise was made by the appointment of a Regency, with a quiet gentleman, of the name of Efi Watt, as its nominal head. It was found, however, after some months\' trial, that the Regency system would not work.

This was so utterly unlike all former coronations which we have seen or heard off here, that we could only conclude that the Consul must have been acting under special instructions from the Foreign Office. The ceremony, such as it was, took place in the presence of a select few. Most of the European traders were present, but comparatively very few of the natives. No representative of the mission was present. The senior brother had a notification of what was to take place, but as it was not accompanied, as on former occasions of the same kind, by a request to conduct a suitable religious service, he thought it better not to be present.

I agree that in coast towns in the Colony the extra-mural interment law should be strictly enforced; but in the Protectorate, which extends beyond the Colony into the interior, and includes Croboe, fussy officialism is now doing harm, as the people strongly resent interference in their customs. That Commissioner Williams should have insulted the Croboes by demanding the exhumation of the King\'s body, is a most regrettable proceeding, for a riot would have certainly ensued had he insisted on his imprudent order being carried out. Full inquiry should be made into this matter, as the Croboes are allowed by the Queen to enjoy the privilege of Native courts.

England had extended to her West African dependencies the privileges of British legitimate trade and commerce, which was a powerful vehicle for the advancement of civilisation.\n\nBringing forward the commercial advancement of the West African Colonies, he said the question had often been asked, ""Do the Colonies pay?"" He could answer with an emphatic affirmative. In 1837 the total external trade of England with all the Colonies was £28,341,471; it was now nearly £300,000,000, thus showing an increase of about ten times. The British shipping in connexion with the Colonies in 1837 was 3,677,975 tons; in 1885 it was 56,611,075 tons. The English Customs returns reckoned the exports to the Colonies in 1837 at £11,283,363; and this had since risen to £54,545,553. Her Majesty\'s Colonies, he said, furnished more than a quarter of the whole world\'s annual supply of gold. He then referred to the commercial geography of the British African Colonies, gave the value of their exports and imports, and reviewed the trade generally. The construction of a railway to the interior of Africa from Lagos was a recent proposition and a new feature in the history of the West African Colonies. It was obvious that Africa was, or would be, the only continent open for the future expansion of British manufacture; in such a case the interior would play an important part. He maintained, with eminent authorities on the subject, that by native agency alone, under foreign supervision necessarily, could tropical Africa be gradually and definitely developed on any permanent basis, and that the negro should be educated industrially and otherwise with the generous help of Europe and America. Whatever was accomplished by native agency, England certainly should carry the credit of effecting such accomplishment in the civilisation of Africa. It was beyond doubt that the English were acknowledged the best colonisers; and the marked consideration invariably shown by them to the people whom they undertook to govern, the extreme liberty and entire privileges of a British subject extended to every native, and the judicious caution characteristic of the policy of the British Government had altogether won for England this success and the preference to all other civilised nations.

That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers.

They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

The Phoenicians treated the part of Africa which they colonised as the British would, as the foundation of trade and commerce. The Phoenicians were followed, about 650 B.C., by the Greeks, who founded their first African colony Cyrene, on the coast of Tripoli. Then came the Carthaginians. They and the Greeks carried on a busy commerce all along the Mediterranean coast, far down to the Atlantic coast, to the mouth of the Red Sea. These were followed by the Romans, who continued an active career on the African coast until the decay of the Roman Empire.\n\nMr. Scott Keltie showed how little was known of the interior of Africa up to 150 A.D. by Ptolemy\'s map being thrown on to the sheet in the darkened theatre. This map, which was filled up haphazard fashion, gathered up, the lecturer said, all the knowledge of the continent which had accumulated during this long period of commercial activity — a knowledge which amounted to very little beyond the coasts and the Nile Valley. The next important period dealt with was the period of Arab invasion and the spread of the tenets of Mohammedanism — namely, from the seventh to the fifteenth century. In the early part of the fifteenth century commenced the ""glorious"" period of Portuguese activity, which lasted for some sixty years, during which the contour of the coast of Africa was completely laid down. This began the real modern partition of Africa, and the lecturer dwelt upon the effect which could be traced to Portuguese occupation of African territory — that occupation being marked by ruin rather than by enterprise. He rapidly traced the occupation of points of territory by Portuguese, Spanish, French, English, Dutch, Danish, and Germans, whose commerce was in ivory and slaves. He held that the opening up of the continent of Africa might be said to have begun with Bruce\'s travels in Abyssinia in the latter part of the eighteenth century. From that time until 1850 nearly the whole map of Africa became gradually filled up, and from 1850 down to the present day the southern half of the continent had received increasing attention at the hands of explorers until it also had had its main features laid down.

That man had his own private interest, backed up by Government authority, and he went on pushing his contracts in the name of the Government till he went too far, and, perhaps, trod upon the toes of the English traders. Then representations were made by our traders, communications passed between the foreign Government and our own Foreign Office, and the matter was settled by the foreign Government simply saying that the man had exceeded his instructions. It was necessary, in order to stop that class of agents from going beyond their instructions, to set the English Government to work. The Government of England represented the people, and unless the people formed on opinion, and represented it to the Government, it did not seem to be the duty of the authorities to act. This was a matter in which the large interests of the African section of the chamber were particularly concerned, and they were the people of this country in this particular case. They wished to speak with one mouth through the chamber to the Foreign Office, so that they might request the Government to put a stop to those malpractices. A similar case arose some two or three years ago in the neighbourhood of Lagos, where the French were doing the same thing as they were now doing at Sierra Leone. They tried to get behind the Colony of Lagos, and made a treaty with the King of Abeokuta in order to cut off the stream of trade that came down from the interior to Lagos, and to turn it down to the French territories so that it might be exported from French ports. The chamber sent a deputation to Lord Knutsford, and his lordship had to go to the Foreign Office in order to communicate with the French Government. The result of the negotiations was that the treaty was abandoned, the French Government stating that it was a mistake, the efforts of the French local authorities were rendered futile, and the English were now carrying out their trade very satisfactorily. They addressed the Foreign Office this time on the advice of Lord Knutsford, who had stated at the last deputation that it was necessary to communicate with the French Government through the Foreign Office.

563,Establishing a supreme authority among local chiefs and clearly defining their responsibilities could stabilize conflict-ridden regions and restore peace without resorting to war.,"The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the claim that establishing a supreme authority among local chiefs and clearly defining their responsibilities could stabilize conflict-ridden regions and restore peace without resorting to war. The General History of Africa highlights the historical role of local chiefs in governance, noting their use by colonial powers like the British and French as intermediaries in indirect rule, which underscores the potential stabilizing effect of clearly defined local authority. However, it also points out that the effectiveness of this approach varied, as seen in the French colonial administration, where the undermining of chiefs' authority sometimes led to instability. The textbook further illustrates the success of shared authority in Futa Jallon, where rotating leadership between families maintained political unity, yet it also warns that external imposition or manipulation of authority could provoke resistance. Similarly, The African Times articles discuss the potential for peace through influential mediation among chiefs in the Sierra Leone river region, exemplified by Sir Samuel Rowe's successful peace efforts. The articles also mention the formation of an association advocating for the Governor's power to enforce treaty obligations, aligning with the idea of a supreme authority. However, they also acknowledge situations where force was considered necessary, such as using a gunboat to quell disturbances, highlighting the complexities of achieving peace. Together, these sources support the claim's premise while recognizing the challenges and intricacies involved in using local authority to stabilize regions.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several insights that relate to the claim about establishing a supreme authority among local chiefs to stabilize conflict-ridden regions. The text discusses the role of local chiefs in both pre-colonial and colonial contexts, highlighting their importance in administration and governance.

However, the effectiveness of this approach varied, as seen in the French colonial administration, where chiefs were often used directly and subordinately, undermining their authority and potentially destabilizing regions. Additionally, the text mentions the compromise in Futa Jallon, where rotating leadership between two families helped maintain political unity, indicating that clearly defined roles and shared authority could indeed stabilize regions. Conversely, the text also highlights instances where the imposition of external authority or manipulation of local chiefs by colonial powers led to instability and resistance, suggesting that the mere establishment of a supreme authority is not always sufficient for peace.

These changes occurred without civil strife, in part because there had always been considerable autonomy in outlying districts, the growing prosperity of which made office at the capital less important.\nSo far only the upper levels of the administrative system have been discussed. Administration at the 'grass roots' was more uniform (and similar to that found elsewhere in West Africa). The smallest units, households or camps, were grouped into larger units, defined by a territory or by kinship. Generally pastoralists, Tuareg or Fulbe, were more organized through links of kinship than were agriculturalists, and in consequence retained their own ardo'en or tambura as leaders. Their cohesion gave them a political strength that the more fragmented agriculturalists did not have, but this superior strength relative to the rest of the population did not last into the second half of the century.\nIn larger, long-settled towns and villages ward representatives could be co-ordinated by one of their number, known as the mai gari, magaji, dagaci or mukoshi.

As a necessary part of tax collection, the administration gathered political information, ratified appointments; collected shares of inheritance, took charge of and dispatched the property of strangers who died en route; organized the arrest of a criminal or a runaway slave, forwarded defendants in civil cases, arranged the release of someone wrongfully detained or someone to be ransomed; took intractable cases for mediation by the office› holder or themselves answered charges of oppression by complainants at the amir's personal court; and in time of war organized the recruitment of people for campaigns.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.599, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Political structures', 'content': ""Of the major states that survived from the eighteenth century, few could have done so without major internal reform.

Few were allowed, like Benin, to merely contract and survive.$^{7}$ Most, like, for example, Asante, Dahomey and Buganda, had constantly to maintain and even improve on their efficiency largely in terms of the ability of the ruler to centralize power, weaken subordinates, extract more and more surpluses from them; monopolize major economic and stragetic resources; institutionalize a hierarchy of officials dependent on the ruler for appointment, advancement and discipline; and sustain these powers by the establishment and control of a standing military force, commanded by officials similarly dependent on the ruler.

In practice, the chief was invariably a member of the Nyorgo family. The insignia of the office was a staff (symbolizing stock-breeding) hung with various kinds of agricultural products.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration.

It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

Fully to appreciate how this worked, we must remember that the sultan's administration was often indirect, being delegated to local chiefs, Islamic clerics or shaykhs. When the sultan was unable to lead the resistance himself, every individual thought of safeguarding his own privileges, or 'climbing on the bandwagon' as one specialist in native affairs put it. 42 France had no difficulty in obtaining help to conquer Tuât from the Sherif of Wazzän (who could take up ziyâra (collections) among his followers in Algeria only with the permission of the French governor), at Shinkït from Shaykhs Sïdiya and Sa'd Büh, in the Tafilälet from the leader of the NÆsiriyya zäwiya, and lastly in the Rïf from the chief of the Darkäwa.

But the impact of this 'native policy' must not be exaggerated. Whenever a chief favoured the French, he immediately lost his prestige and was no longer of any use: so much so that in the end the authorities no longer sought public submissions.\nThe tendency of leaders of zarväyä and the great chiefs to compromise and play a double game thus resulted not so much from ethnic divisions and rivalries as from the disappearance of the supreme political power, whose successive defeats exposed its military weakness.\nHistory has handed down to us the names of some thirty chiefs who led the resistance against the French, Spaniards and Italians during the period 1900-35, not counting Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karïm and 'Abd al-Malik.$^{43}$ The others can be divided into two quite distinct groups regardless of their success or failure."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.594, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of Senegambia and Upper Guinea', 'section_title': 'Upper Guinea and Futa Jallon', 'content': ""The power of Futa Jallon rested on military force, on the hordes of white-robed horsemen that came down from the high sandstone plateau to raid and then return.

This famous compromise obviously did not always work well and led to countless conflicts, but in the main it was effective. Civil wars were, in fact, a built-in feature and a normal way of achieving power, and the rules merely limited the amount of violence. This itself avoided the break-up of the kingdom: the split between the two parties was reproduced at the level of every diwal and missidi. Thus, although the great northern diwal of Labe, dominated by the Jallo (Diallo), was alone more powerful than all the rest of the Futa it never occurred to it to break away.\nThese divisions were deep for all that, and limited the Fulbe's ability to pursue aggressive policies.

Chieftaincies were abolished where considered superfluous and created where considered colonially useful. Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief. As Delavignette described the situation with satisfaction, the colonial administrator was not an administrator at all, but a commander and recognized as such by the African population under his control. His primary function, he asserted unequivocally, 'is to act as a chief.$^{19}$ The reserved and unobtrusive role which Lugard had hoped the British Resident would generally play in Northern Nigeria was denied in their territories by the French and Portuguese administrators, both sets of whom were prominent in the exercise of local authority.

Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated.

Quite depopulated, with the exception of here and there a few huts, occupied by starving people, the dense and solitary forest is rapidly enveloping them.

The blood seems to chill in our veins as one reads the brief but fearful detail of the committal of a crime atrocious in its execution as in its conception and preparation. It is not the case of a man stung to frenzy by some real or supposed wrong, inflicting summary vengeance; but an act long contemplated, often before essayed, and ultimately successful under circumstances that cast a fearful shadow over the future. The ""Secret Tribunal of the Nihilists"" had, it is asserted, condemned the late Emperor to death so long ago as September, 1879. Past failures to effect their murderous design seem only to have impelled them to new efforts until they unhappily achieved it during the return of the Emperor from a review on the day above-mentioned. The marvellous self-devotion of the actual perpetrators of the crime, the ready obedience paid by them to the commands of the Secret Tribunal which placed in their hands the fearful weapons of vengeance employed on this melancholy occasion, to be used by them with certainty of their own death in or by the act, fills one with horror as we realize how difficult, how almost impossible, it must be to escape from the carrying out of that Tribunal\'s decrees. Still we do venture to hope that Alexander II. will have been the last victim. It is not easy for a ruler, however well-disposed, to cure in a moment the various political and social diseases of a mighty empire such as Russia. That cure, however, must be at once attempted, and resolutely persevered in, as the only way by which the dagger, the revolver, the explosive bomb, can be struck harmlessly from the hands of would-be assassins. Alexander III. will, we hope, make his life so precious in the eyes of all his subjects that ""Nihilism"" will perish, and Russia take its place among those tempered monarchies in which the ruler is not held personally responsible for all the evils committed by those who conduct affairs in his name.

At last the efforts made have been crowned with success. The contending factions were grouped into two opposing sides. On the one side were the Ibadans, a powerful tribe situated right in the centre of the region of the war, and, therefore, surrounded by enemies; and on the other was a confederation of tribes under the general name of the Ekitiparapos. Man-catching was the real object of the war, and herein lay the great difficulty in the way of mediation; for it was obvious that none of the man-catching tribes would surrender their main source of revenue without a struggle. However, with the aid of two educated natives, a treaty of peace was signed in July, 1886, and ratified in the following September.\n\nThe first circumstance which opened up a prospect of successful mediation was an intimation received by Administrator Moloney, at Lagos, of a quarrel between the King of the Sebus and his people, the former wanting to continue the war and the latter to end it. It was not till long afterwards that Sir Samuel Rowe felt he was justified in interfering. His first attempt was not encouraging, but ultimately the Kings of the Ekitiparapos confederacy, twenty-six in number, appealed to the Governor, stating their grievances against the Ibadans, and asking him to prevent their being supplied with ammunition from Lagos through the agency of an Ibadan there.\n\nThe answer came from Mr. Moloney, who had assumed the government of the colony, and he addressed it to all the belligerents, rating them soundly for continuing the war, and offering his services as mediator. The replies were favourable. An armistice was arranged, and conferences were held. Statements setting forth the case for each tribe separately were forwarded to the Governor. In one of them (from the commander of the Jebus) the following passage occurs: ""Ile Ife is regarded by all our nation as the sacred spot from which we originated, and the Oni is respected as the father of all the Kings. This is why the Jebu King felt it his duty to reinstate the Ifes in the town. It was from Ile Ife that his father went to settle in the Jebu country. His father did not die, but he was converted into a rock, which could still be seen. Even the English King can be shown the spot at Ile Ife from whence his ancestors went out.

The public meetings held, the lectures and addresses delivered, have amounted to upwards of 350, besides a large number of special sermons on peace delivered by various ministers, at the suggestion of the Committee. The Press has been utilized in various ways. Publications of all sorts, from the octavo volume to the two-paged tract have been issued in a steady stream. The system of supplying newspapers and periodicals with paragraphs bearing on peace and war has, through the kindness of editors, been carried out with great effect. The Ladies' Auxiliary Branch and the Workmen's Peace Association have also been in active operation. A new method of interesting the young in the subject has been adopted by offering prizes to young persons in schools for the best essays on topics connected with the question. The report congratulates the friends of peace on the conclusion of the Afghan war. After spending twenty millions of money in scattering havoc and devastation through that land, we have had to retreat within our own borders, our present rulers having had the courage to withdraw from a position as perilous as it was unjust. The report relates the steps taken by the Committee in reference to the Transvaal question, their deputation to Lord Kimberley, the meetings held in various parts of the country, the memorials presented to the Prime Minister; and they refer to the manner in which the Government, to its infinite honour, persevered in its peace negotiations, even in the face of reverse and defeat. It warns the country against being misled by the wild and alarming reports sent home by a certain class of African colonists who detest the peace, and are bent upon rekindling a war which would subserve their interests at the expense of the mother country, which will have to bear the cost. The report next speaks of M. Richard's motion in the House of Commons, in June last, in favour of a mutual reduction of armaments, which, after eliciting an interesting discussion and an admirable speech from Mr. Gladstone, was carried, not in the original form proposed but in an amended form suggested by Mr. Bright. It refers also to the other Parliamentary resolution, submitted by Mr. Richard last month, on the conduct of British representatives abroad, in contracting engagements and making war without authority from the central Government, which also called forth a most valuable speech from the Prime Minister, and was lost on a division by a majority of only eight in a House of 137. The report dwells with satisfaction on the general interest which the discussion had excited in the Press, as evidenced by the serious and, for the most part, favourable comments of most of the London and provincial papers. It, however, condemns and deplores the continuance of the Basuto war. Finally, it alludes with satisfaction to the frequency of the cases which now occur of states settling their disputes by arbitration, or some form of peaceable reference, instead of an appeal to the sword. Three such instances have taken place during the past year. A difference between France and the Republic of Nicaragua was, by the wish of the latter, referred to the arbitration of the French Court of Cassation. The states of Chili and Columbia have signed a convention, submitting a dangerous dispute between them to the President of the United States. And still more important is the convention between the United States of America and the French Republic, referring a variety of contending claims existing between the two Governments to three commissioners, one to be nominated by the President of the United States, one by the French Government, and the third by the Emperor of Brazil, all which, it is contended, are significant indications that civilized Governments are gradually awaking to a sense of the reasonableness of adjusting their differences by other means than the brutal arbitrament of war."", 'last_edit_date': '1881-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1881#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.627, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Our Peace-making in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The same claim was made by the Ife chiefs in their statement: ""We wish to be reinstated in the town Ile Ife, which is the cradle of the human race.

Eventually ""points of agreement"" were settled, and at the same time Governor Moloney renewed his denunciation of the human sacrifices.

This question presents two aspects—first, the rights of the grantor; secondly, the rights of the grantee. First, they say, with regard to the law of nations, we must ask ourselves whether the chiefs of savage tribes can make treaties, &c., or whether the tribes they represent are considered as States capable of making international treaties. The answer given was, that the rules of the law of nations had been looked upon as the special privilege of Christian races; and it was only in 1856 the Porte, by the Treaty of Paris, was permitted to participate in the advantages of international law and of the European concert. Therefore his opinion is that it was obligatory on these nations that they should recognize these laws, and they could not allow those nations to participate in its advantages who did not recognize this law as obligatory upon themselves. Publicists and moralists taught that Christian sovereigns should conduct themselves honestly, and observe the rules and justice of equity and Christian morality. Feeble, half-savage races, deprived as yet of the benefits of civilization, are now no longer considered merely as prey for the rapacity of civilized nations, or as furnishing a field for their enterprise. But what are the conditions under which a State can be capable of negotiating treaties? According to Klüber, a certain number of men and families congregating together, and fixing their abode in a country, associating themselves and submitting to a common chief with the purpose of insuring the safety of all, form a State. Sovereignty is acquired by a State at the time of its formation, or when it frees itself from a condition of dependence.

When, in July 1864, Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony was overthrown and replaced by Rainilaiarivony, the latter became both the prime minister and the commander-in-chief of the army, this being the first time that the two offices were held by one and the same person.$^{58}$ When Rainilaiarivony then married the new queen, even though she was past fifty and fifteen years older than him, the new prime minister became the most powerful man in the land.

The effect of all this was to shift the power from the sovereign and the Andriana group to the prime minister, who was the head of the Hova oligarchy. 59 In order to improve the maintenance of law and order and the functioning of the administrative organs of the state, a Code of 101 articles was promulgated in 1868, from which date more articles were added every year until the final figure of 305 articles was promulgated in March 1881. The general theme of the Code was that the customs and traditions of the country would be allowed to continue as long as they did not obstruct innovation. The Code of 101 articles which was printed and circulated was severe in its application, but certainly an improvement on old customs in many ways. It reduced 'the number of offences punishable by death from eighteen to thirteen - one of wilful murder and the other twelve being various forms of revolt against the state.'

The first was the political evolution of the country and the diplomatic interaction between Madagascar and foreign powers, particularly Britain and France. Second, major changes took place in the social organization of the country, par› ticularly in the religious, administrative and economic fields. Political evolution consisted mainly of the consolidation of the Merina monarchy and the expansion of its authority to the rest of the island. The diplomatic relations that this monarchy maintained with both Britain and France became a cornerstone of the country's development. The changes that were effected in administration, particularly in the establishment of law and order, facilitated economic development. This was also a major factor in Madagascar's efforts to modernize itself and to resist foreign domination. The embracing of foreign religions was viewed as part of this process of modernization.\nA brief description of the country and its people may be necessary here. There are some eighteen ethnic groups in Madagascar of which the largest and, as it turned out, the most important in the nineteenth century, are the Merina who live on the central plateau of the island. This central plateau, known as Imerina (the country which one sees from afar), was the home of the Merina among whom there was a privileged class who came to rule the greater part of the island before it was colonized by the French. It is difficult to say what the population of Madagascar was during the period under review, but the British consul in Madagascar estimated it to be 5 million in 1865, of whom about 800 000 were Merina.$^{1}$ All the Malagasy groups speak the same language and have, with few exceptions, similar customs and religious traditions. Thus, despite the existence of regional differences, the Malagasy were, and have remained, one people, with one profound cultural and ethnic unity. 2"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Madagascar 1800-80', 'section_title': 'Rana valona I (1828-61): a period of reaction or stabilization?', 'content': ""The religion spread underground, with clandestine meetings of Christian communities in caves (e.g. in the region of Fihaonana in the Vonizongo, north-west of Imerina) and in private homes, even in Antananarivo. A group of Christians fled to Britain where they prepared themselves for an eventual return as missionaries. The Jesuits, for their part, organized a mission to the Petites îles (Nosy Be, Nosy Faly and Mayotte in the north- west and Sainte-Marie in the east) from where they tried to infiltrate to the mainland, especially the Bay of Faly, which they were forced to leave in 1857. This has been referred to by some writers as 'the darkest period of Ranavalona's reign',$^{28}$ and Ranavalona has earned such names as the 'Queen Mary of Madagascar', 'a modern Messalina or female Nero'. Even so, the Malagasy court was anxious not to break completely with Britain, so as to avoid confrontation with a hostile alliance of Britain and France.\nThe Malagasy leaders realized that the country needed contact with the outside world, to secure European manufactured goods, particularly guns and ammunition. They also wanted to buy luxury goods such as cloth and alcohol and to expand their exports, mainly cattle and rice, to Mauritius and RØunion in order to pay for the necessary imports. Queen Ranavalona therefore wanted to find a modus vivendi with the Europeans, to enable her country to develop without the fear of European antagonism and war. In pursuit of this policy, she and her advisers decided in 1836 to send an embassy to France and England and to negotiate fresh treaties of friendship and commerce, based on respect for Malagasy culture and independence and to secure recognition for Ranavalona I as Queen of Madagascar.$^{29}$ The Malagasy embassy - the first ever to be sent to Europe - consisted of six officers and two secretaries and was led by Andriantsitchaina.$^{30}$ Their stay in Paris was uneventful and they then crossed the Channel to London. They were accorded an audience by King William IV and Queen Adelaide, but their talks with Lord Palmerston were unsatisfactory.

For instance, the Vakinisisaony, the ancestral land of the Imerina kings and the initial region of adoption of sampy such as Ikelimalaza, held the privilege of conferring legitimacy on the sovereign. However, throughout the nineteenth century, the inhabitants of the Vakinisisaony, who had a reputation for toughness, suffered under the burden of forced labour and felt the full weight of-the power of the Avaradrano, the people who had supported Andrianampoinimerina. Many of the Andriana, or nobles, of the Vakinisisaony were eliminated, as in the case of the guardians of Ikelimalaza, which was first confiscated by Andrianampoinimerina and then burnt down in 1869. From that time onwards, opposition to the Christian government crystallized round the worship of this sampy in the southern part of Vakinisisaony. In the northern part of the toko, groups that continued to respect the traditional religion, and Christians existed side by side. However, splits occurred among the Christians in the villages, as in the case of Ambohimalaza, where the nobles and slaves were predominantly Catholic and the commoners were Protestants. The same contrast between advocates of the traditional cults and Christians was to be found in other districts.

It is now necessary to turn to the evolution of the country in the field of administration and socio-economic development, particularly since developments in these areas were to prove crucial in Madagascar's struggle for survival as an independent state during the period of the European Scramble.\nOne of the most important events that occurred in Madagascar in this period, which was to have a tremendous impact on later developments, was the conversion to Christianity, in February 1869, of Queen Rana valona II and her Prime Minister and husband, Rainilaiarivony. The zeal with which the missionaries worked, after their return to Madagascar in 1861, clearly indicated that there would soon be a religious revolution in the country, country. In 1863 there were already about 5000 Christians in the Malagasy capital out of a total population of some 60 000 people.

Persecution could not be used as a means of eliminating Chris› tianity: it had been tried in the 1830s and 1840s and it had failed. By the 1870s, the persecution of Christians would have meant trying to eliminate the most influential part of the population. The LMS converts had found leader in Rainimaharavo, the Malagasy Foreign Minister and Rainilaiarivony's open rival for leadership, who also happened to be proBritish. In order to neutralize Rainimaharavo and avoid a radical Christian revolution that may even have led to the replacement of Queen Rana valona II by Prince Rasata (an LMS protege) Ranav alona and her Prime Minister decided to embrace Christianity.$^{51}$ This is not, of course, to suggest that they did not believe in what they professed; but it does explain why and how their conversion to Christianity occurred at the time it did."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Madagascar, 1880S-1930S: African initiatives and reaction to colonial conquest and domination', 'section_title': 'A country divided in the face of the imperialist threat > The situation on the eve of the first Franco-Merina war 3', 'content': ""There was scarcely any foundation for all these arguments devised by the advocates of the colonization of the island.

That purportedly 'barbarous' kingdom, where the 'forces of darkness' predominated, was, in fact, ruled by a queen and a prime minister who had been converts to Christianity since 2i February 1869. It is true that they had been baptized as Protestants and that the majority of the leaders and the population had followed their example, but they had not prevented people from embracing Catholicism nor had they thwarted the activities of the French missionaries. This liberal attitude goes to show the separation that existed between the churches and the state, even though 'around the chapel in the queen's palace, the Prime Minister may have tried to form a national Church, the Palace Church, composed of Malagasy churchmen and evangelists in his service'. 5 These attempts gave rise to lingering fears among the Jesuits and to an 'incorrigible mistrust' among the representatives of the London Missionary Society (LMS).\nIn 1877, the royal government freed the Masombika slaves imported from the African mainland and arranged for them to be settled on lands allocated to them. In 1878, it recast the legal system, which was henceforward entrusted to three courts whose task it was to conduct investigations, while decision-making lay with the prime minister. The 'Code of 305 Articles, a legislative innovation embracing civil law, criminal law and legal procedure'$^{6}$ was promulgated in 1881.

That claim, which had its roots in the memory of the annexation proclaimed under Louis XIV and of the fruitless attempts made in the eighteenth century to set up a prosperous France Orientale, based on the trading posts established in the eighteenth century and under the Restoration, was developed throughout the nineteenth century in a large number of written documents before being put to the French parliament officially in 1884.

These refusals to co-operate did not seem dangerous to the colonizers, who believed that peace had finally been established in Madagascar in 1905.

In the largest room on the ground floor of the palace was a hearse, covered with scarlet and gilt, in which the corpse was supposed to be, but I am informed it was not really there. The room was full of women, who were wailing; some were kneeling, with their faces buried in their hands, and bowed to the ground; those nearest the corpse had fans of scarlet cloth, beautifully embroidered with gold, to keep away the flies.

The French had hitherto met with no resistance, and this has, perhaps, rendered them over-confident; but it may be taken for granted that if they land, leave the protection of the big guns of the fleet, and attempt to make their way through the broken and fever-haunted country which stretches for 200 miles between Tamatave and the capital, their difficulties will really begin.

Those who know anything of Madagascar history know the unpronounceable name of Andrianampoinimerina, who held sway from 1787-1810, and who brought much of the island to be subject to the Hova tribe. He had a favourite sister, Rahety by name, and it was at one time thought that her descendants might ultimately obtain the crown; but she gave birth to twins, and had no other issue. For fear, then, that the descendants of these two children should dispute as to their rights to the crown they were both put aside. In course of time one of these lines became extinct. As the late Queen lay on her death bed, very early in the morning of her death, a young girl of about twenty years was awakened out of her sleep in a house about a mile from the palace and taken at once into the presence of the dying Queen, who there and then named her as her successor, and exhorted her in some parting words to trust in the same God as she had trusted in. This young girl, Rajáfindrahety by name, was great-grand-daughter of the Rahety above spoken of. She was well educated in the schools of the Quakers in this city, and latterly in that of the London Missionary Society, and was, I am told, most promising and intelligent. There is another curious thing connected with it. Some three or four years ago she was married to a nephew of the late Queen. Little over two months ago, on May 7, her husband died. If this had not taken place it may be safely said that the girl would never have been Queen. The present Prime Minister would never have suffered any one to be Queen to whom he could not have had access, whether by night or day, and there is no doubt that very soon, even if it has not, as some say, already taken place, he will become the husband of the present Queen, and, unless prevented by the French, become far more powerful than he has ever yet been. Indeed, this is even now evident. For the first time in the history of Madagascar there has been not only no bloodshed, but not even commotion of any kind. The new Queen, under the title of Ranavalona III., has been accepted by the nation as their Sovereign. There is, indeed, no doubt but that some would have preferred a King but as long as the present Prime Minister has power there is no chance of this. He is not of the royal family, and could never become King; this he well knows, and is content with his present position and power.'}]","[{'document_title': 'MADAGASCAR', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'King Radama II. has been crowned at his capital of Antananarivo. The Rev. Mr. Ellis has sent home a very detailed account of the ceremony, which we hoped to have had the pleasure of laying before our readers this month. Circumstances have unfortunately prevented our doing so. The French papers say that mass was performed over the crown, before the latter was used for the coronation. If this be true, our impression is that it must have been done clandestinely. There is no tendency toward the religion of Rome in Madagascar; and the King is known to incline toward the Protestant faith.\n\nThe following appeared on Sunday, the 14th inst., in the _Moniteur_ (Paris), immediately after the announcement of the coronation:—\n\n""A treaty of commerce, on the largest basis, has been concluded between France and Madagascar. All other nations have obtained equally favourable terms.\n\n""The treaty makes no mention of territorial concessions—a subject which might have given rise to grave difficulties.""\n\nWe were very glad to see this, and hope and believe it was intended as an official contradiction of an article which appeared in the Paris paper, the _Opinion Nationale_, of the previous Thursday, as follows: ""King Radama II., King of the Hovas, has ceded to France the Bay of Diego Suarez, a magnificent anchorage, where the world\'s navies might ride quietly, while storms and typhoons rage in the ocean. The surrounding country, which is, of course, also ceded, is described as being clad with primeval forests of magnificent timber, and pouring forth plenteously the richest produce of the tropics.\n\n""At the instigation of England, in 1822, the King of the Hovas assumed the title of King of Madagascar, but France energetically protested against the usurpation of the right to reign over an island which belongs to her. In 1840, the Sclavo princes of the north, our old and faithful allies, driven to desperation by English attempts to oust them, came in a body, and offered to cede their territories to Admiral Tell, Governor of the Island of Reunion. This offer was accepted in 1841, and since then France has occupied the islands in the vicinity of Diego Suarez—viz., Mayotte, Noja Bé, and Nossi Comba; and the Bay of Diego Suarez therefore belonged to France already. Our claim is undoubted. We cannot understand why _La France_ should speak of the King\'s \'generosity\' in ceding to us what was already ours, nor that this cession will in any way vitiate our claims to the Island of Madagascar.""', 'last_edit_date': '1862-12-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1862#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MADAGASCAR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Madagascar has become doubly interesting to us since the establishment of what may be called ""constitutional checks"" on the power of the Sovereign.

That a revolution so recent, so sudden, and involving the assassination of Radama, who had been greatly beloved by large classes of the people, should be followed by temporary disorder and acts of hostility on the part of outlying tribes, was naturally to be expected. Such events, we have every reason to believe, have actually occurred. The Sakalavas, for instance, have always been forward to assert their independence, and at least a part of that tribe appears to have seized the opportunity to make inroads and commit acts of plunder upon the property of the Hovas.""\n\nIn the last letter received from the Rev. Mr. Ellis (the only dependable authority), dated July 2, these acts of hostility are alluded to, and it would seem that the danger had passed away, and that representatives from the different native tribes were then in the capital, professing their allegiance to the Queen."" The following, on the above subject, and on the general character and proceedings of the Government, are from Mr. Ellis\'s letter:—\n\n""A number of representatives from the Betsileo, the Sakalavas, and the Betsimisaraka, have come and are still coming to take the oath of allegiance to the new sovereign.

The affairs of the kingdom constitute now the business of the Government, in which Christians and Hovas are combined, promptitude and activity are everywhere apparent, and all parties are more careful in their public conduct. This state of things is not unfavourable to the Christians. The hereditary policy of the Hovas is \'Things as they have been;\' \'The wisdom of our ancestors cannot be surpassed.\' But so many innovations have turned out improvements and benefits, that the aim now seems to be to adopt what is good in the new, while retaining what they can of the old.

When the Protestant places of worship were opened, there was great astonishment at the number of Christians who presented themselves after their long concealment under most dreadful persecutions.\n\nBy last advices three Roman Catholic priests and four sisters of charity were likewise there; and six priests, with four lay assistants, left Aden in the steamer, on Dec. 12, to reinforce the mission.\n\nThe report made to the Governor of Mauritius by the embassy he sent to the new King of Madagascar is very interesting and important.

With this fact in mind, all approach, or appearance of approach, to that point must be carefully avoided, in act and word, by all members of this mission.\n\nThe following from the report seems to dispose of the falsehoods of the French press about Prime Minister Lambert:—\n\nAlthough there is every disposition on the part of the King and his Government to welcome Europeans, and treat them with respect and kindness, there is yet no truth in the report that the King has sought their official counsel, and has appointed one among the European residents to fill an important executive office. Such a step would be entirely opposed to the spirit of the Madagascar Government.\n\nIn reference to the general joy manifested at the presence of the English, it says:—\n\nWe need not look for an explanation of this feeling. The missionary work, initiated thirty years ago, will sufficiently account for it. Nearly all the arts with which the people are acquainted were taught them by the missionaries, and your excellency will see with astonishment with what patience their workmen carry out any given task, and often with implements ill fitted for the performance of it.

With the view, also, of shielding the perpetrators of the intended murders, the King announced his intention to issue an order, or law, that any person or persons wishing to fight with fire-arms, swords, or spears, should not be prevented, and that if any one were killed the murderer should not be punished. This alarmed the whole community. On the 7th inst. Radama repeated before his Ministers and others in the palace his determination to issue that order; and among all the Mena maso present only three opposed the issuing of the order; many were silent; the rest expressed their approval. The nobles and heads of the people spent the day in deliberating on the course they should pursue, and the next morning the Prime Minister, with about 100 of the nobles and heads of the people, including the Commander-in-Chief, the King\'s Treasurer, and the first officer of the palace, went to the King, and remonstrated against his legalising murder, and besought him most earnestly not to issue such order. It is said that the Prime Minister went on his knees before him, and begged him not to issue this obnoxious law; but he remained unmoved. The Minister then rose and said to the King: \'Do you say before all these witnesses that if any man is going to fight another with fire-arms, sword, or spear, that you will not prevent him, and that if he kills any one he shall not be punished?\' The King replied: \'I agree to that.\' Then said the Minister, \'It is enough; we must arm;\' and, turning to his followers, said, \'Let us return.\' I saw the long procession as they passed my house, grave and silent, on their way to the Minister\'s dwelling.

Twenty thousand representatives have declared that Madagascar shall not, without a desperate struggle, be subordinated to French rule. The vast arena of Andohalo—the public meeting-place of Antananarivo—presented the appearance of an amphitheatre. On every side huge multitudes stood, listening to the statement of the Prime Minister that M. Le Myre de Vilers has presented such demands to the Malagasy Government as would, if yielded to, for ever make the Malagasy the dependents of France. ""Has the Government been right in rejecting the demands?"" his Excellency asked, as he finished his speech on the French ultimatum. And in answer to the inquiry, there went up a shout of derision at the French demands. There was no doubt left that ""the heart of a people beat with one desire."" Then the national indignation broke through the desire for peace, and a torrent of eloquence rushed from the mouths of scores of orators. The ""love of peace that was full of wrongs and shames"" was over and done. But there was no wish for war. Only a determination to face that alternative, should France assail the independence of the Malagasy.\n\nWe British dwelling among this people believe that the British Government will not exercise every resource which diplomacy admits to attain a revision of an Anglo-French Convention.\n\nThe Europeans in the interior are pursuing their usual vocations; indeed, there is no need for a feeling of uneasiness. The Prime Minister recently received a deputation from them with the greatest cordiality, dwelling affectionately upon the good-will between the British and Norwegians, and the Malagasy. And he assured them that there was no danger for British and Norwegians, and besides they could always rely upon the personal friendship that he had for every one of them.\n\nThe French officials, previous to their departure, burnt up the Residency effects.

The city was in great commotion; all night women and children and slaves, with portable valuables, were hurrying from the city, while crowds of armed men from the suburbs were crowding into it. At daybreak on the 9th some 2,000 or more troops occupied Andohalo. The ground around the Prime Minister\'s house, on the summit of the northern crest of the mountain close by, was filled with soldiers, while every avenue to the city was securely kept by the Minister\'s troops. The first object of the nobles was to secure upwards of thirty of the more obnoxious of the Mena maso, whom they accused of being the advisers and abettors of the King in his unjust and injurious measures. A number of these were taken and killed, a number fled, but twelve or thirteen remained with the King. These the nobles required should be surrendered to them. The King refused, but they threatened to take them by force from the Palace, to which the King had removed. Troops continued to pour in from adjacent and distant posts; and, as the few soldiers with the King refused to fire on those surrounding the Palace, the people, though pitying the King, did not take up arms in his defence. He consented at length to surrender the Mena maso, on condition that their lives should be spared, and that they should be confined for life in fetters.

The General History of Africa describes how kings in the Shona and Lunda states were perceived as having sacred qualities and a close relationship with the supernatural, which bolstered their authority as spiritual guardians and symbolic owners of the land. This divine association enabled them to control land allocation and demand taxes, enhancing their power. However, the text also highlights instances of political instability, such as Radama's assassination in 1863, which was partly due to his inability to manage opposition to his policies, indicating a power struggle. The disintegration of centralized powers like the Luba 'empire' due to internal dissensions and external pressures further supports the claim of political instability and downfall. While the textbook does not explicitly state that nobles opposed the king's absolute sovereignty due to his belief in divine right, The African Times articles provide additional context by describing how the King of Madagascar's superstitious beliefs and spiritualism led to dangerous proposals, such as legalizing murder, which alarmed the community. This prompted opposition from nobles and ministers, culminating in the King's overthrow and death at the hands of the nobles. Although the articles do not detail the aftermath or the power vacuum, they corroborate the claim that the King's belief in divine right and absolute sovereignty resulted in political turmoil and his downfall.

To a certain extent this power vacuum reflected the past inability of many Central African societies to organize or sustain a centralized political system. Many of the Lunda and Shona states had also undergone a process of political fractionalization. North of the Zambezi, the slave trade intensified internal rivalries in the kingdoms of the Lunda of Kazembe, Undi, Kalonga and Lundu that left them vulnerable to the seditious activities and attacks of the slave traders and their Nguni counterparts. To the south, cleavages within the Shona aristocracy, coupled with the devastating raids of the Zwangendaba and Gaza Nguni, substantially weakened the regional powers. The incursions of Zwangendaba, for example, are generally credited with destroying the badly divided Rozwi kingdom of Changamire, while the division of the Barue state into two competing factions, coupled with the debilitating Gaza raids, enabled the Goan adventurer Gouveia to usurp temporarily the Barue throne around 1875. 97 Gouveia's success was part of a larger process by which Yao, ArabSwahili, Chikunda and Nguni invaders took advantage of the power vacuum to impose conquest states.

First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante.

With a large force of infantry and cavalry, he met Moshoeshoe at Platberg on 15 December 1852 and delivered an ultimatum that was impossible to fulfil. Moshoeshoe was ordered to produce within three days 1000 horses and 10 000 cattle, which would be used as com› pensation for the Boer property lost during the Warden war and also to finance Cathcart's own current expensive expedition. When Moshoeshoe failed to meet the deadline and pleaded for more time, Cathcart ignored the King's excuses and ordered an invasion of what is today Lesotho. But he met with such stiff resistance from the Lesotho infantry and cavalry that he was only too willing and relieved to withdraw when Moshoeshoe displayed a diplomatically submissive posture in a letter dated 20 December 1852. Moshoeshoe beseeched the High Commissioner to be content with the loot of over 5000 cattle which the Governor's troops had managed to capture. The King confessed himself sufficiently punished and indeed well impressed by the power of the British and therefore begged for peace. He would also in future try to prevent his people from causing disorder.

One of these visions, seen by many, was the ancestors of the King, and the voices they heard announced the coming of these ancestors to tell the King what he was to do for the good of the country. Subsequently a message was brought to him as from his ancestors, to the effect that, if he did not stop \'the praying,\' some great calamity would soon befall him. To the surprise of his best friends, the King was exceedingly interested in this strange movement, seemed to believe the pretended message from the world of spirits, and encouraged the frantic dancers, who daily thronged his house, and declared that the disease would continue to increase till \'the praying\' was stopped.

With a view of increasing the influence of this fanatical party, the King issued an order that all persons meeting any of the so-called sick should take off their hats, and thus show them the same mark of respect as was formerly given to the national idols when they were carried through the city. With the view, also, of shielding the perpetrators of the intended murders, the King announced his intention to issue an order, or law, that any person or persons wishing to fight with fire-arms, swords, or spears, should not be prevented, and that if any one were killed the murderer should not be punished. This alarmed the whole community. On the 7th inst. Radama repeated before his Ministers and others in the palace his determination to issue that order; and among all the Mena maso present only three opposed the issuing of the order; many were silent; the rest expressed their approval. The nobles and heads of the people spent the day in deliberating on the course they should pursue, and the next morning the Prime Minister, with about 100 of the nobles and heads of the people, including the Commander-in-Chief, the King\'s Treasurer, and the first officer of the palace, went to the King, and remonstrated against his legalising murder, and besought him most earnestly not to issue such order. It is said that the Prime Minister went on his knees before him, and begged him not to issue this obnoxious law; but he remained unmoved. The Minister then rose and said to the King: \'Do you say before all these witnesses that if any man is going to fight another with fire-arms, sword, or spear, that you will not prevent him, and that if he kills any one he shall not be punished?\' The King replied: \'I agree to that.\' Then said the Minister, \'It is enough; we must arm;\' and, turning to his followers, said, \'Let us return.\' I saw the long procession as they passed my house, grave and silent, on their way to the Minister\'s dwelling.

The city was in great commotion; all night women and children and slaves, with portable valuables, were hurrying from the city, while crowds of armed men from the suburbs were crowding into it. At daybreak on the 9th some 2,000 or more troops occupied Andohalo. The ground around the Prime Minister\'s house, on the summit of the northern crest of the mountain close by, was filled with soldiers, while every avenue to the city was securely kept by the Minister\'s troops. The first object of the nobles was to secure upwards of thirty of the more obnoxious of the Mena maso, whom they accused of being the advisers and abettors of the King in his unjust and injurious measures. A number of these were taken and killed, a number fled, but twelve or thirteen remained with the King. These the nobles required should be surrendered to them. The King refused, but they threatened to take them by force from the Palace, to which the King had removed. Troops continued to pour in from adjacent and distant posts; and, as the few soldiers with the King refused to fire on those surrounding the Palace, the people, though pitying the King, did not take up arms in his defence. He consented at length to surrender the Mena maso, on condition that their lives should be spared, and that they should be confined for life in fetters.

Some time previously Mr. Gilbert Carter, then administering the government with a view to put an end to a war which had devastated the country for some years, had entered into treaties with this chief and another, Beram Ceasey, whereby the district of Baddiboo was to be jointly ruled by them, and they agreed to a cessation of hostilities, and to refer any cause of dispute to Bathurst for settlement. The former Chief of Baddiboo, Mahmoud 'Dery Bah, who had long ceased to have any real power, was deposed so far as any recognition of his authority was concerned at Bathurst. The kingdom of Baddiboo is a rich district lying on the north bank of the River Gambia, extending for about sixty miles east and west, and with an average breadth of about twenty miles. Lying to the north of Baddiboo is Saloum. In past times a Mohammedan marauder named Hamah Bah, or Mabah, overran the whole district, and was recognized as the Chief of Baddiboo and Saloum.\n\nIn October 1864, a treaty was made between the French and Mabah, but he was killed in 1867 in endeavouring to conquer more territory, and before his death he arranged with his\n**53**\n\nheadmen that his brother Mahmoud 'Dery Bah should become Regent for his son, Saide Mattie, who was not old enough to take charge of the kingdom.

One Beram Ceasey was master of the eastern part of Baddiboo, and Saide Mattie commanded the western portion; the divisions being about equal. At this time, owing to the constant fighting, industry had come to a standstill, and something had to be done to restore tranquillity to the district. Accordingly, Mr. Carter conceived the idea of bringing Saide Mattie and Beram Ceasey together, and recognizing them as joint rulers of Baddiboo. After long negotiation, this idea was fully realized, and once more preparations were made on a large scale to carry on the usual planting operations in Baddiboo; but, just at this juncture Saide Mattie, who had gone up to Saloum to settle some dispute with his old enemy, King Gadel, was attacked by the French and driven into British territory, with the result which has already been detailed. Saide Mattie has ever since been a refugee, kept in semi-custody at Bathurst, and Baddiboo has been, it is said, formally annexed by the French. The tricolour has been hoisted at 'Yoro and at Jerong, a town close to the bank of the river, and most probably the trade of this rich district has departed from us for ever.""}]","[{'document_title': 'DEATH OF THE KING OF ASHANTI.—BRUTAL SLAUGHTER OF 300 VICTIMS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A letter received from Ashanti, by last mail, represents that country as being in a disturbed state, owing to the deaths of the King and his well-known predecessor, Koffee Kalkalli.

A blow was thus firmly, slowly, and persistently struck, and the supreme authority, power, and even influence of the kings, chiefs, and headmen gave way to the powerful Governor Maclean (I shall not enter into details, or I shall be assailing the sanctuary of the dead).

The first treaty was that of 1873, which gave Ja Ja power to fine all European traders who attempted to trade beyond certain defined limits in his territory. The treaty of 1884, concluded after the Berlin Congress, established a protectorate over Opobo. All went well until 1886, when, trade in palm oil being depressed, traders wished to get rid of the middlemen and trade directly beyond the districts opened to Europeans in Opobo. To this King Ja Ja objected. Consul Hewitt had assured him that by the protectorate the Queen did not want to take his country or his markets; that she had no wish to disturb his rule. Nevertheless, because King Ja Ja refused to allow the European traders to break the express terms of his treaty by trading directly in the reserved region, he has been first fined, then his trade has been destroyed, and lastly, he has been arrested under circumstances of great treachery by Consul Johnston, and carried off a prisoner to the Gold Coast.

There is no doubt that in many states in Africa, partly as a result of the large increase in the number of the educated elite and the 'ulama$^{y}$, who naturally began to demand a say in the administration of their countries, a number of political and constitutional experiments were embarked upon. In fact, the Fulbe djiKàd of the first half of the nineteenth century could also be described as the militant political answer to this confrontation between the new educated elite of the 'ulama* and the traditional ruling elite, while the Joola rebellions of the second half of the nineteenth century could be regarded, as indeed Yves Person has shown, as a revolt of the educated mercantile class against the conservative ruling elite.$^{57}$ In other parts of Africa, especially on the west coast, this confrontation was not resolved in such a militant and violent way, but rather in more constitutional approaches. Indeed, during the period under review, the educated elite did not seek to replace the old aristocracy as the national leaders of the people as they were to do in the 1920s and 1930s but rather sought accommodation within the system and co-operation with them. In this connection, we have already referred to the constitutional experiments that followed the Yoruba migrations. However, nothing illustrates this trend better than the Constitution of the Fante Confederation of the Gold Coast, drawn up in 1874. Articles 4, 5 and 6 of that Constitution read: 58 The objects of the Fante Confederation as stated in this Constitution were no less interesting and significant. These were to promote friendly intercourse between and to unite all the kings and chiefs of Fante for offensive purposes against their common enemy; to make 'good and sub› stantial roads throughout all the interior districts included in the Con› federation' which were to be 'fifteen feet broad, with good gutters on either side'; and establish schools for the education of all children within the Confederation and 'to obtain the service of efficient school-masters'. Others were to promote agricultural and industrial pursuits and introduce 'such new plants as may hereafter become sources of profitable commerce to the country' and, finally, to develop and facilitate the working of the mineral and other resources of the country.

But for reasons to be discussed later, the British had killed this bold and interesting initiative stone-dead by 1873. 59 A similar constitutional experiment was that of the Egba United Board of Management formed at Abeokuta.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

But the new governors were overthrown and replaced by pre-existing dynasties during widespread revolts against his increasingly harsh rule. 20 The similarities between Liberia's and Ethiopia's political systems were too obvious from the analysis thus far to belabour. Besides possessing a core and periphery, and a central government, each had sub-political systems centred on local chiefdoms (or villages) like those of the Gola in Liberia or the Oromo ('Galla') in Ethiopia not discussed in this chapter, with political cultures more or less different from the dominant political culture at the centre.

Cutting across the lineage system of non-centralized societies, a variety of integrative institutions developed in the religious, judicial and economic fields which could function as an overall framework of order or replace a disintegrating state-system.$^{25}$ The poro and similar associations in Upper Guinea, or various so-called 'secret societies' in the Cross river and equatorial forest areas of the Cameroons and Gabon are examples.

The first was the new interest which the Duke of Brabant, crowned a constitutional king (Leopold I) of the Belgians in 1865, proclaimed in Africa.

M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization. The egregious exception, however, was South Africa where the concept of'native authority' was the means by which the white minority assured local administration of Africans now displaced by the policy of segregation to territorial reserves."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Political structures', 'content': 'The Mfecane spread far and wide a new model of the northern Nguni state as revolutionized by Shaka.

The interrelationship between kingship and fertility underpinned the mys› tification of the ruler and reinforced his position as symbolic owner and spiritual guardian of the land. As a result, he retained the exclusive right to allocate land, which was the basis of control over subordinate chiefs and other subjects and underpinned a cycle of reciprocity.

Throughout both state systems, moreover, the largest tusk of a dead elephant automatically belonged to the monarch as owner of the land. In some societies, such as Manica, the Lunda of Kazembe, and Undi, the monarch also maintained a theoretical monopoly over commerce, while in Changamire's kingdom the ruler was the ultimate owner of most cattle.$^{5}$ These tribute, labour and commercial arrangements enhanced the power and wealth of the monarch, who redistributed to his principal lieutenants a portion of the surplus which he extracted, to ensure their continued loyalty.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': ""If the more abiding claims of ethnic integrity were not always respected, neither were the more ephemeral claims of conquest states and empires to territorial integrity. The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'Treaty-making 1885-1902 > The bilateral European partition treaties', 'content': ""The acquisition of a sphere of influence by treaty was usually the first stage in the occupation of an African state by a European power. If such a treaty was not contested by any other European power, the incumbent power gradually turned its treaty rights into sovereign rights.

Often spheres of influences were contested, but these territorial difficulties and boundary disputes were eventually settled and ratified as a result of mutual agreements between two or more imperialist powers operating in the same region. The limits of these territorial settle› ments were determined, as closely as possible, by a natural boundary, or, where no such boundary existed, by longitude and latitude.

As we have seen above, the fundamental issue at stake between the 1880s and the 1900s as far as the African rulers were concerned, was that of sove› reignty, and on this, it was quite clear that nobody was prepared to compromise. Those African rulers who have been mistakenly termed collaborators were those who thought that the best way of safeguarding their sovereignty or even regaining the sovereignty that they might have lost to some African power previous to the arrival of the Europeans was not to collaborate but rather to ally with the European invaders. A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation. But as we have seen, the Africans were all faced with the question of surrendering, retaining or regaining their sovereignty.

The question was, did those conditions exist in the territory under discussion?\n\nThey were generally agreed that the mere fact of a British protectorate as it now exists was not sufficient for that development of trade and commerce they all wished for, because individual mercantile firms could not and would not penetrate into the various creeks and navigable rivers, owing to the insecurity of life and property which attended such ventures. As they contented themselves with carrying on trade on the coast line the consequence was the amount of trade was limited, and new and more extended markets for Manchester cotton goods were kept closed. It was said the remedy was the creation of a Crown colony, but they were confronted with the disposition of the Government not to increase their direct responsibilities in Africa. This was apparent from the recent granting of Royal charters to the Niger Company, the East African Lakes Company, and that in South Africa. The nature of the climate made administration by the Crown most expensive and the Government of semi-civilised tribes most difficult to accomplish. Then, again, Crown colonies on the west-coast of Africa have not been marked by signal success, because it was only the coast line that was annexed, stretching inwards for a few miles, the chiefs or petty kings in adjoining districts being bought over. This arrangement was generally very inadequate. Other Powers wormed themselves into the vicinity of such possessions from the interior, and in this way Sierra Leone has been deprived of some of its best markets. The establishment of a Crown colony in the oil rivers district would not, if established on ordinary lines, guarantee the development of commerce they desired to see. Who were better qualified than the African Association to exercise jurisdiction? for they understood the peculiarities of the native tribes, the wants of the country, and were best able to increase trade. They would be able, too, to prevent the encroachments of other Powers. There was no reason, either, why the association should interfere with free trade.

These and other matters have already been the subject of decrees. Lynch law is one of the first things the Government of a new State should put an end to; the King's first detailed code of laws, therefore, relates to the penal organization and the punishment of offences. This code regulates criminal procedure, and specifies punishment for offences occurring in the relations of Europeans and native races. The Court of Appeal is fixed at Boma, and Courts of first instance will be established at other places as necessity dictates. As regards the composition of the Court, it is made up of a magistrate appointed by the King, and a public prosecutor appointed by the resident Administrator-General. It was not advisable to provide for jury trial in the new State, but in cases involving the penalties of death or penal servitude, assessors will sit on the bench. A list of the leading residents, public servants, officers, and merchants, will be drawn up by the Administrator-General, and assessors will be drawn by lot from this list. In the Courts of first instance two will sit, and in the Court of Appeal four. There will be no difference between them and the magistrate while they are on the bench, the code not distinguishing between the verdict and the sentence, which will be rendered by the majority. If there is an equal division, the prisoner will be acquitted. Both prisoner and public prosecutor can appeal. The decree does not interfere with the native jurisdiction in offences between natives unless a European interest is involved. Thus only in three cases will the natives be amenable to European justice, viz.: 1. Where the offence causes a prejudice to a non-native or the State. 2. Where it is committed in a State establishment, or in the house or establishment of a non-native, or within a kilometre of such establishments. 3. Where it is connected with an offence imputed to a non-native. One of the first acts of the Financial Department has been to lay down the rules governing the acquisition of land in the new State. This is one of the most difficult problems which present themselves in the relations of civilized and non-civilized races. Colonel de Winton considered it so urgent that he issued an ordinance on the subject last July, declaring that no contract or convention with the natives for the occupation of any part of the soil would be recognized by the Government unless made with the intervention of a public officer appointed for the purpose. It also provided that all non-occupied territory belonged to the State, and forbade the dispossession of natives. In August the King signed a decree indicating the nature of the registration to be inaugurated. The mode of determining the rights of property claimed is based on the example of the Australian Acts.

Most of the roads and railways were constructed not to open up the country but merely to connect the areas having mineral deposits and potentialities for the production of cash crops with the sea or, to quote Fieldhouse, 'to link internal areas of production to the world commodity market',$^{20}$ and there were hardly any feeder or branch roads. Nor were they meant to facilitate inter-African travel and communication. Such infrastructure as was provided was meant, then, to facilitate the exploitation of the resources of the colonies and to link them with the metropolitan countries but not to promote the over all economic development of Africa nor to promote inter-African contacts. In the second place, such economic growth as occurred in the colonies was based on the natural resources of the area and this meant therefore that areas not naturally endowed were totally neglected.

The first of these is the fact that some of these boundaries cut across pre-existing ethnic groups, states and kingdoms and this has caused widespread social disruption and displace› ment. The Bakongo are, for instance, found divided by the boundaries of Angola, Belgian Congo (now Zaire), French Congo (now Congo) and Gabon. Today, some of the Ewe live in Ghana, some in Togo and some in Benin; the Somali are shared among Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti; the Senufo are found in Mali, Ivory Coast and Upper Volta. The examples can be multiplied. One important consequence of this situation has been the chronic border disputes that have plagued the relations between some independent African states - such as those between Sudan and Uganda; between Somalia and Ethiopia; between Kenya and Somalia; between Ghana and Togo; and between Nigeria and Cameroon. Secondly, because of the arbitrary nature of these boundaries, each African nation-state is made up of a medley of peoples with different cultures, traditions of origin and language.

In the first place, as S. Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

Thus, under the colonial system, Africans were in most cases made to produce what they did not consume and to consume what they did not produce, clear evidence of the lopsided and exploitive nature of the colonial economy. In those parts of Africa where Africans were not allowed to grow cash crops such as Kenya and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), as Colin Leys has shown, 'within the space of a generation they had effectively been converted from independent peasants, producing cash crops for the new markets, into peasants dependent on agricultural wage-labour'. 27 Sixthly, the commercialization of land already referred to led to the illegal sale of communal lands by unscrupulous family-heads and to increasing litigation over land which caused widespread poverty especially among the ruling houses. In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Moreover, as a result of colonialism, the African himself was looked down upon, humiliated, and discriminated against both overtly and covertly. Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence. It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y.

This is usually provided through a diffusion of the culture of the colonizer through education. Attainments within the educational system established for this purpose provide the yardsticks for raising a new group of elites among the colonized society. However, the diffusion of the imported culture of the colonizer almost invariably involves not only harmonious culture contacts, but also culture conflicts, which could find expression in violent reactions from the subject people. Apart from this, there is always the problem of conflict of interests as between the colonizer and the colonized, the former working to perpetuate control, the latter struggling for self-fulfilment either through accommodation within the colonial system or through the recovery of independence and sovereignty.\nAs M. Crowder has shown above (Chapter 12), the First World War raised the hopes of the emergent educated elites all over Africa for greater opportunities for their being identified with the processes of development in their respective communities. They expected to be absorbed and accepted as colleagues by the colonial rulers; but as the colonial situation became more and more of a reality they found their expectations checkmated or frustrated. Even where mass recruitment of European personnel during the war had led to job opportunities opening up for educated Africans, the realities of the post-war period soon caused disillusionment and discontent. Educated Africans not only found themselves placed in inferior positions vis-à-vis the European personnel of comparable training and experience with whom they served in the same colonial administrations, they were also kept in the background socially. Having been educated away from their indigenous milieu with the encouragement that the education they were getting would lift them into the European world, they were men who were largely alienated from the masses of their people in terms of orientation, life style, ambition and expectations of rewards in material and social terms. 2 The barriers which the illiberalism inherent in colonialism erected against them were, therefore, a source of resentment, bitterness and agitation against the colonial regimes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'African nationalism and international developments', 'content': 'The situations which African nationalists found themselves in the inter-war years were essentially the same: deprivation of political and social liberties; exploitation of human and material resources to the benefit of the alien rulers; denial of facilities and services which could contribute to the political and social upliftment of the colonized societies or, when it became clear that changes could not be prevented, the pursuit of actions aimed at limiting and reorientating the course of development with the main objective of perpetuating colonial dominance.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in the face of partition and conquest', 'section_title': 'The ideology of resistance', 'content': ""Colonial apologists stressed the irrationality and desperation of armed resistance.

The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ...

But it was not African sovereignty and independence alone that had been lost at that time. It represented also an assault on established cultures.

The Emperor's Chaplain was soon called, and from his hands His Imperial Majesty took the last Communion and quietly expired shortly afterwards, at about a quarter to four.

Thus an Africander Republic—the United States of South Africa—will spring into existence. There will be no stability in this new Republic, and financial difficulties, native rebellions, and other troubles will result.

The chief object of the officers is to get rubber and ivory at any price rather than to civilise, and they make no scruples in setting one tribe against another, using the stronger as a catspaw to obtain the ivory from the weaker. Great loss of life is the result, and it is no wonder we hear at intervals of officers being massacred. In addition to the ivory in the Native villages, the river is closely watched. A canoe laden with ivory is seen coming down the river in the evening, and signals are made for the Natives to stop and bring in their goods on the usual terms—that is to say, at a much lower price than could be obtained from any independent trader. Of course, the Natives paddle away as fast as possible, whereupon they are at once fired on and either killed or compelled to bring in their ivory. Another serious matter—one which is attracting the attention of the British Government—is the wholesale recruiting by Belgian agents of British subjects in Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and Barbadoes. Although, as the result of representations made to the Colonial Governments concerned this is being gradually suppressed, at one time almost every ship brought a number of men who had entered into contracts with the State to act as labourers. Once in the Congo the word ""travailleur"" was erased, and ""soldat"" substituted. Comparatively few of these people ever return to the coast. They die in the interior, usually of starvation. The result of all this is that hundreds of miles of the country are desolate, and that the Natives are leaving for the French sphere.\n\nIt is only fair to say that the high officials on the coast are not wholly responsible for this, and that some slight attempt is made at Boma, for instance, to educate the children, and so forth. The interior is in a constant state of siege, and legitimate trade is stagnated. There can be no doubt that had the Congo people the power of cohesion, the Belgians would have long since been swept out of the country, and that the British and other foreigners, who are all classed as whites, would have shared a similar fate. The suspicion entertained by one tribe of another is the Belgians\' only safety.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1895#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.606, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Critical Condition of the Congo Free State', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Murphy next proceeded to give incidents of the barbarities alleged to have been perpetrated by the State for the purpose of obtaining rubber; and observes that some radical change in government must take place before there can be any hope of prosperity. It may well be supposed that the country is in a disturbed state. The people of the district of Lake Mantumba, of Irebu, and Lokolala and all the Mobangi towns have crossed over to the French side. Going over to the French side meant that they would become homeless and hungry wanderers. Even then the State could not leave them in peace; they heard that they came over at night to their old homes to get food, and they stationed canoes and lay in wait for them, with orders to shoot all they caught, and to my knowledge they shot seven people in one night. The State is strong enough to-day to do these things because the people lack unity. They have no leaders, no common cause, and no weapons to fight. Their condition is deplorable, and needs our sympathy, as well as all that European public opinion can do to secure for them the blessings of a righteous government under which they can live in peace.\n\nRegarding the State officers and their manner of administration, Mr. Murphy said: ""The white officers do not know the language of the people they govern, and trust too much to their Native soldiers, who are, as a rule, men belonging to a hostile tribe, whose chief aim in life is to plunder. These men are sent out to fight very often without any responsible officer being with them, with the result that many cruelties are perpetrated which might have been avoided. It is impossible for the Governor at Boma—four weeks\' journey from Stanley Pool, which ought to be the real seat of Government—to manage his vast and unwieldy territory, so that the commissaires and petty governors of the interior districts have almost unlimited power. The officers of the State are young and inexperienced; they do not come out as colonists to develop the country, but in order that they may receive quick promotion, the Congo decoration, and, above all, to get money.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-12-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1895#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.602, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Critical Condition of the Congo Free State', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Further details of the state of affairs in the Congo Free State have been lately received. They are furnished by the Rev. John B. Murphy, of the American Baptist Mission, who has just reached England. Mr. Murphy comes from Equatorville, an important centre of the State Government, 800 miles in the interior, and has lived on the Congo for the past nine years. Regarding the situation when he left in August, Mr. Murphy said:\n\n""When I left the people were in a very unsettled condition, and most unfriendly to the State. The revolt which had broken out in the Aruwimi district had been quelled, but not until the State troops, which had retired upon Basoko and had to withstand a siege there, had been reinforced. Scarcely, however, had the steamers which had been sent to the relief of the station returned to Stanley Pool before two were again despatched to quell another disturbance which had broken out at Luluaburg on the Kasai. This time it was a revolt of the State troops against their own officers. The soldiers killed one and wounded another, leaving him for dead upon the field. They then looted the station and escaped into the interior. Although the authorities sent up a strong detachment of forces from Stanley Pool, most of the fugitives are still at large. I was near the mouth of the Kasai when the news of the revolt came down.\n\n""The attitude of the Natives of the Congo State is unfriendly, and if they do not rebel it is because they are reduced to a state of despair. If possible they leave the territory. Two of the most flourishing towns at Stanley Pool—viz., Kintamo and Kinchassa—are now no more, and the people have gone over to the French Congo. Besides, many people have left the main river and gone into the interior to escape the arbitrary demands of the State. Difficulties arose, too, between the State and the porters, and if the requisite number of carriers were not forthcoming detachments of soldiers were ordered to capture all the women they could find. Several Christians were arrested in this manner. The Natives and missionaries remonstrated, and presented a letter to the Governor without getting any redress. The people were so enraged at these outrages that they took matters into their own hands. They killed three white men and met and defeated the State forces in more than one pitched engagement. On the Lower Congo the Natives have good Snider rifles, and their many conflicts with the State have taught them the arts of war. In some of the fights the State soldiers could not see their foes as the latter were in ambush. The result was that they were just mowed down by their opponents\' guns.""', 'last_edit_date': '1895-12-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1895#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.608, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH MISRULE IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Probably it will be said that this picture is grossly exaggerated—a mere caricature.* But the fact remains that it is an Englishman who speaks, and thereby condemns his own country for the century of misrule under which Sierra Leone groans.

The officer in charge had to purchase medicines and food at exorbitant rates from the Dutch house at Banana. The natives round Vivi having committed various thefts, were being shot down, their villages burned, their crops destroyed, their palm-trees felled, their women and children carried into captivity by officers of this purely philanthropic Association! The natives near Lutité were in open rebellion. Tippoo Tib, a powerful native chief on the Upper Congo, with 1,000 armed men, was making raids on the territory of the Association and carrying off the inhabitants as slaves, which the officers of the State are unable to prevent or punish, for they have but few armed men left in their employ. Almost all the Houssas and other time-expired men have refused to re-enlist. Fresh men cannot be obtained either at Lagos, the Gold Coast, or from the Niger. To protect and to hold in subjection the vast territory which the Free State claims requires at least 2,000 well-armed, well-disciplined, and well-officered men. There are barely 200 left.

Mr. Stanley asserts that there is waiting for the enterprising merchants of Europe produce in the interior of Africa which will give a return of £240,000 a year.

Mr. Tisdell, an American gentleman deputed by the United States of America to travel over the Congo region, and to report on its state and capabilities, has just returned, and reports: \'The reputed wealth of the Congo Valley has been greatly exaggerated. It will be an undesirable and an unprofitable country for an American to make his home, or in which an American can embark in any business enterprise.

A desperate war is ravaging the richest region of South America. The South Seas are perturbed with anxieties and desires concerning New Guinea and the New Hebrides. Asia has its Tonquin question in the south, and throngs of other questions in the west and north. Europe is overridden with armies and with difficulties, civil, religious, and international. But any who love to fish in troubled waters may be recommended to turn their thoughts to Africa in preference to all. Africa riots in questions of every sorts and to suit every taste. Spain has its eyes upon new possessions in Morocco. France, besides its latest preoccupation with Madagascar, remains busy with Tunis, and has not made up its mind about Tripoli. A British army holds half of Egypt, and a religious war engages the rest. Abyssinia is so habituated to anarchy that itself and its neighbours are scarcely conscious of agitations which are as violent as ever. On the West Coast every few months the British public hears that it has been warring with negro tribes and desolating their homes in the interests of civilization and commerce. A new element of curiosity and excitement may at any moment be now anticipated from the contiguity of Mr. Stanley and M. de Brazza. Mr. Stanley, it is announced, has been instructed by the Association which commissions him to be as friendly towards M. de Brazza as is compatible with the defence of its territory against trespassers and a protest against annexation. Mr. Stanley\'s acquaintances will know how he is likely to interpret those liberal instructions. It will be surprising if an iron will like his and a fiery ambition like M. de Brazza\'s find the Congo or an entire continent sufficiently spacious to contain both. In North Africa and in the central west various white races share the duty of preserving the country from stagnating in peace. In the south the European ingredient is less multifarious. It is not at all less proficient in the art of setting itself and its native neighbours by the ears. The Cape Government enjoys a profuse choice of subjects for solicitude and controversy. Basutoland has not ceased to be a care because the colony has determined to wash its hands of the glory and cost of its custody. All its chiefs are proposing to fight, and they are too close to the colonial borders for Cape colonists to look on with composure at the conflict. The Pondos are as restless as the Basutos, with the additional vexation that when they are not fighting one another they are lifting the cattle of white farmers across the frontier. In the interior a multitude of critics are inclined to scrutinize suspiciously the new policy towards the Basutos. The Transvaal has its hands still full of contentions with Caffres within and without. It wants British money, and it wants to curtail the little British influence the Convention allowed. On the southeast coast, Natal, according to its custom, is equally uneasy and unable to decide on the precise form the remedy for its grievances should take. Hardly a section of African soil, north and south, and east and west, is without its vexations and feuds, in which Europe is obliged to interest itself, and of which the telegraph is compelled to attempt to chronicle the shadowy stages. A predominant sentiment of Englishmen at home, as they read these fragments of obscure African news, must be a desire either to know more or nothing, to be able to intervene with effect or not at all. On the Congo it is pleasant to feel that Mr. Stanley may be left to himself. He is not an English subject; and his enterprise, however sincere the sympathy of Englishmen with its objects, is not an English enterprise. Yet even on the Congo England has considerable mercantile interests at stake, and owns corresponding rights which it cannot surrender or suffer to be trampled on. Higher up, on the Gold Coast, its powers are larger, and it exerts them more amply. There would be a satisfaction in knowing the principles on which the periodical shelling of negro villages for offences against English trade proceeds, and whether the Colonial Office have a policy in relation to such matters, and what it is. On the Gold Coast there is nobody to interfere with England, and English supremacy, it may be suspected, is used at times somewhat too vigorously. In Egypt it might be wished on behalf of Egypt itself that it were used more masterfully than at present. Europe regards England as responsible for the health of Egypt; and England hesitates to assume the prerogatives which that responsibility implies. South African embarrassments permit an easier remedy, with a diminution instead of an increase of the burdens of empire. England often finds imperial responsibilities heavy without being free to abdicate them.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1883#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.598, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We desired, for the credit of native Africa, to see the republic rise to the same degree of commercial and agricultural prosperity as is attained in our own colony of Natal.

She does not yet understand that Africa is to be for the African or for nobody.\n\nIt is significant that Africa was shut up until the time arrived for the emancipation of her children in the Western World. When Jefferson and Washington and Hamilton and Patrick Henry were urging the freedom of the slave, Mungo Park was beginning that series of explorations which has just ended in the expedition of Stanley. Just about the time that England proclaimed freedom throughout her colonies, the Landers made the great discovery of the mouth of the Niger; and when Lincoln issued the immortal proclamation, Livingstone was unfolding that region which Stanley has more fully revealed and which is now the scene of the secular and religious activities of Christendom.

It is much to be hoped that this is the case, for at the present time trade needs fostering on the West Coast more than perhaps ever before, and this object can only be attained by the cheerful co-operation of all interested in its maintenance. The British administration in West Africa has been by no means free from faults in the past; and these faults have born their natural fruit. The secret of good Colonial government would seem to consist in interfering as little as possible with Native customs and prejudices, but at the same time making it thoroughly understood that laws and ordinances must be respected.

We cannot get the inland territory under our own influence again, and our coast colony may become a seaport without a trade.

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs. It shows nice powers of observation—great diligence—a clear appreciation of facts, and a mental daring that does not shrink from the great problems of the future of the various divisions of his race, on which the light of Christian civilisation is only now beginning to shine, and who are for the most part placed under circumstances most unfavourable to its increase. After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries. Showing us their actual condition, and exposing many errors of administration which are opposed to material development and social advancement, he views the whole in connexion with the resolutions of the late House of Commons Committee, 1865, recommending the preparing of the several people for self-government. He shows the great changes that must be induced and fostered to make such self-government possible, safe, or beneficial. Though he has evidently a deep and, we believe, a just faith in his race, he does not shut his eyes to any of the disadvantages of their actual position and the difficulties in the way of their progress toward Christianity, civilisation, and wealth.

It is about 102 years old, thus considerably younger than the Gambia, which almost ranks with Newfoundland as being one of the very first British possessions abroad. Sierra Leone, however, has not much to show for its century of British rule. Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary. Here at present the great Mahommedan Chief Samadu is the actual ruler, and has created one of those African empires which are easily reared by successful robbers with extravagant bloodshed and widespread depredation.

This was, however, concentrated on activities related to cotton and its export. Major irrigation projects were undertaken. The Aswan dam, the largest in the world at that time, was completed in 1902 and made higher in 1907-10; the Delta barrage was reinforced and put into service, and so also were the Zifta, Asyßt and Esna barrages. About 13 500 km of canals were dug during Ismail's reign (1863-^79). Thus the cultivated area rose from 4.76 million feddäns in 1881 to 5.66 million in 1911. It was also possible after the extension of the perennial irrigation to grow more than one crop. Therefore, the crop area increased to 7.71 million feddäns in 1911.$^{47}$ The bulk of the increase was used up by cotton not only because it was more profitable than other crops but also because of British encouragement since cotton was both a cash crop which enabled Egypt to pay her debts and a much-needed raw material for Lancashire.

We shall begin rather with the case of Egypt. Prior to 1730, Egypt's production was part of the division of labour in the Ottoman world-empire. Egypt served as one of the granaries of this historical system as well as a major transit point in long-distance intercontinental luxury trade. In the second half of the eighteenth century, the internal contradictions of the Egyptian system, combined with a decline in demand for prior exports, had led to a fiscal crisis of the Egyptian state structure, and consequently to an increase in taxation, which thereupon led to peasant resistance through abandonment of lands. At the very same time, the expanding capitalist world-economy was seeking to include Egyptian production within its network. This effort was made concrete in the active military competition of France and England at the end of the eighteenth century to control the region. The Egyptian response took the form of the coming to power of Muhammad 'All and his attempt to 'modernize' Egypt.\nIn economic terms, this 'modernization' involved the establishment of a stable export of an agricultural good. For various reasons having to do with the comparative ecology and political structures of the capitalist worldeconomy, long-staple cotton was a better option for Egypt than wheat. But the large-scale production of cotton required a change not only in the irrigation system but also in the social relations of production. Muhammad 'All installed a state monopoly of trade with direct collection of taxes by salaried bureaucrats. This led to increasingly regulated control over peasant production practices, and impressment for work on infrastructure and for military service. Eventually this was converted into corvØe labour on private large estates, whose extent grew from about 10 per cent of the arable land in 1818 to about 45 per cent by 1844. This process was further intensified after the death of Muhammad 'Alï, continuing the expropriation of the peasantry, and culminating in the major peasant-supported 'Urabist revolt in 1881-2, itself one of the factors leading to the establishment of British colonial rule. The entire transformation of the productive process resulted in the creation of a sizeable stratum of landless rural workers, direct supervision of agricultural work, and a significant increase in total work time required of the peasantry. 8"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.711, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The renaissance of Egypt, 1805-81', 'section_title': 'The economy, society and culture: the dialectics of modernity and tradition > Agriculture and land use', 'content': ""There are other facts which deserve to be made clear. It was Muhammad 'All who diversified the crops and, in particular, from 1821 onwards inten- sified the growing of cotton, on the advice of Jumel who gave his name to the new variety of long-staple cotton. The Jumel cotton along with the American 'Sea Island' type afforded the state - with its monopoly of foreign trade - an appreciable income, since in 1845 the crop amounted to 424995 kantärs, produced on 212 ^·¡feddäns, an increase of 400 per cent in twenty years. Of this, a maximum of 80 000 kantârs went to Egyptian spinning mills, leaving 344 995 kantârs for export. The experts were unanimous in their praise for the Viceroy's policy of agricultural modernization: 'First of all, [he] supplied the capital that was needed to transform the Egyptian agricultural economy from a subsistence economy to a cash crop economy and he did this without sacrificing the production of cereals, upon which the Egyptian agricultural economy had always been based'. 15 The Viceroy described himself as being primarily 'a farmer and a merchant', especially in talking to foreign observers. He used the word farmer in the sense of the Pharaohs; lords of the 'hydraulic society' of which Egypt offered the most compact and striking example throughout the ages. He used the corvØe to have thirty-six canals and drains dug, the best known being the Mahmüdiyya canal; blocked up the Phar'awniyya, which was unusable, and put up fifteen bridges and twenty-three dams on the Nile, including the big dam at the Delta, al-kaæatir al-khayriyya, not to mention numerous repair works. Such efforts were concentrated on Lower Egypt. There seems to have been a slackening off towards the end of the reign just when the commission appointed in 1838 recommended an extremely ambitious plan for irrigating 3800000 feddäns. Muhammad 'All hesitated to devote a considerable part of his resources in men and materials to building new dams when the economic, political and military offensive of the European powers had begun to take shape. 16 It was no accident that it was the British who carried out Muhammad 'Alfs ambitious project after their occupation of Egypt.

The accumulation of a huge public debt begun in 1858 was to finance the infrastructural projects as well as the extravagances of some of the monarchs. The law of liquidation of 1880 had fixed Egypt's public debt at £98.37 million and during the next twenty years a further £18.2 million was borrowed. Egypt's liabilities to foreigners had reached £E 8.5 million per annum by 1914.$^{a5}$ Establishing export surplus was vital to meet those liabilities.\nThe American Civil War stimulated the production and export of cotton in Egypt. Output increased from a little over half a million kantärs in i860 to over 2.1 million in 1865, to 4.1 million in 1890 and to 7.7 million in 1913. However, after the rapid increase in the price of cotton caused by the American Civil War, prices continued to fall until the end of the century and the rise in production was insufficient to offset the fall in prices. During the first decade of this century, cotton prices more than doubled, and the value of the crop rose to over three times what it had been at the beginning of the occupation. In 1916 cotton prices rose to an average of US $38 and again to US $90 per kantär in 1919; exports jumped to £E 88 million in 1920 and a large export surplus was built up. 56 The financial achievement of the British administration was to ensure the proper collection and administration of the increased revenues accruing to the government out of this surplus.

However, it must be remembered that the British were trying to develop alternative sources for their cotton requirements. Instead of relying solely on the United States for the supply of cotton to their textile industry as was the case before the American Civil War, other sources were sought. Egypt had comparative advantages over other possible suppliers like India and Brazil. In other words, the main concern of the British was to secure a stable source of raw material for their textile industry. Hence, it was not surprising that most of the government capital expenditure was directed towards the promotion of the export sector. It was argued that a considerable investment in the irrigation network, despite Egypt's difficult financial situation, was necessary to increase the revenues to repay Egypt's foreign debts.

The autarchic economy set up by Muhammad 'All was to help further his plans of founding a modern Egyptian national state at the heart of an empire. Despite the setback of 1840, Ismail was able to return to the route mapped out by Muhammad 'AIL The pressure ofinternational big business followed by its penetration, and, finally, the occupation of Egypt in 1882, were to affect this basic situation in two very significant ways. They led, first, to the creation of a single national market - thanks largely to the major efforts undertaken by Ismä^ - and, secondly, to the integration of the Egyptian economy into the international economic system through the contracting of loans and, above all, the cotton monoculture.\nThe work of Muhammad 'AIT deserves closer scrutiny. Muhammad 'All was alone among contemporary Eastern Islamic rulers in considering economics as underpinning politics, and this is what made this canny Albanian officer a statesman. The state he planned to establish was defined initially in 1805 as an ethnic formation centred around a powerful and efficient army, itself buttressed by a self-supporting modern economy. 13 From 1818 to 1830, he created important industrial units: the munitions and ordnance factories at the Citadel, which reached their apogee in 1828 under Adham bey; the munitions factory at the Arsenal; the gun factory at Hüd al Marsüd (1821) which included five gunpowder factories producing 15874 kantärs (1 kantar = 45kg) in 1833; the navy arsenal at Alexandria, built in 1829 by LefØbure de Cerisy who had succeeded the brilliant mastercraftsman Hadj 'Umar; finally, the dry dock built by Mougel in 1844.

How› ever, it is equally true that the British administration's attitude towards the industrialization of Egypt was hostile while the free-trade policy re› sulted in deepening Egypt's concentration on cotton. But during the late 1920s, several important changes were introduced which mark the begin› ning of a new era when attention was directed towards industry. One of the important reasons for these changes was the great depression which resulted in a slump of international demand for raw materials, including cotton. This, in turn, was reflected in a severe deflation of all activities in the Egyptian economy. Therefore, the government policy of free trade came under increasing pressure and calls for government intervention grew stronger. In addition, Egypt's terms of trade deteriorated during the late 1920s. This added more thrust to the pressure to move out of cotton which continued to form the bulk of the exports - into other items. This period also witnessed the emergence of a strong nationalist movement. The 1919 revolution marked the peak of the growth of the Egyptian nationalism which was reflected in the emergence of national entrepreneurs with new ideas regarding the future development of Egypt. Furthermore, while the increase in agricultural output during the final decades of the nineteenth century kept pace with population growth, this was not the case during the first part of the twentieth century; total output in agriculture grew by 30% while the growth of the population was close to 50%. 57 Egypt's population was outrunning the absorptive capacity of agriculture, and other sectors had therefore to be developed to find productive employ› ment outlets and to raise the per capita income.

When the first experiment in Zaydab in 1905 showed promising results, it was extended to the Djazïra plain between the Blue Nile and the White Nile, which contained the most fertile soil in the Sudan. An ambitious plan was drawn up for the Djazïra plain. The Sudan Plantation Syndicate, which was a private concern, was granted a concession to cultivate cotton in this area. The arrangement called for co-operation between the government, the syndicate and Sudanese tenants. The government rented the land from its owners and provided the basic capital expenditure for canalization and the pumping stations. The syndicate was responsible for minor expenditure and for managing the project. It also arranged for the transportation and marketing of the product. The tenants, on the other hand, were to undertake the cultivation. The proceeds of the sale were then to be divided between the three partners in the following manner: 40% to the tenants, 35% to the government and 25% to the syndicate. The shares of both the govern› ment and the syndicate were later changed to 38% and 22% respectively. 61 The Djazïra plan envisaged the irrigation of about 200000 ha on which cotton, millet and fodder were to be cultivated. But the plan was delayed because of the First World War. It was, however, revised in 1919 and was highlighted by the completion of the Sennär Dam in 1925.$^{62}$ The success of the Djazïra scheme stimulated the development of other related activities such as transportation, irrigation and ginning factories for cotton.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'New economic trends', 'content': 'In the economic as in the other fields, some new trends became discernible during our period. The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The renaissance of Egypt, 1805-81', 'section_title': 'The economy, society and culture: the dialectics of modernity and tradition > Towards economic autarchy', 'content': ""This industrial production met the needs of the country both in import substitution and profits of the order of 100 per cent accruing to the national treasury.

The country lacked the essential minerals, iron and coal, and thus had difficulty in obtaining sufficient power to drive its machines. 'Our goal is not to make profit, but to train our people in the use of industrial techniques', Muhammad 'All told J. Bowring, who had come to put the case for an agricultural Egypt.

Thus ended the monopoly established by Muhammad$^{ c}$Alï. Egypt was now open to the penetration of foreign capital, which imposed distortions on the Egyptian economy.

Many parts of the Colony are adapted for the cultivation of rice, and a profitable trade might be carried on therein. The tobacco plant might also be cultivated with advantage. During the last year 744,508 lb. of tobacco was imported into the Colony at the value of £17,591.\n\nThe principal commercial product is the oil palm, which, however, has never been systematically cultivated. The means adopted by the natives for extracting the oil are miserably defective, causing considerable waste. Probably also not more than half the oil-producing palm trees are made use of, the nuts from the remaining trees being allowed to rot on the ground. The want of proper means of communication between the plantations and the trade ports is seriously felt. Better means of communication would lessen the cost of transport and open out the oil-producing districts.\n\nNext in importance are the rubber trees. There was practically no trade in rubber ten years ago, but in 1882 a trade was stimulated, and rubber is now come to be regarded one of the most important staple exports of the Colony. The following figures show the progress which has been made in the decade: 1883, 57,913 lb., £2,371; 1884, 123,843 lb., £18,619; 1885, 93,726 lb., £30,234; 1886, 1,549,121 lb., £69,911; 1887, 1,306,252 lb., £62,430; 1888, 878,367 lb., £38,048; 1889, 1,241,628 lb., £55,197; 1890, 3,361,055 lb., £231,281; 1891, 2,946,913 lb., £198,901; 1892, 2,663,020 lb., £166,659.\n\nCoffee and cotton are cultivated in small quantities and the soil is admirably adapted for their growth. Cotton is indigenous and has been used by the Natives from time immemorial. The raw material has never become a staple export, and the cultivation of it is mainly carried on by the natives who inhabit the districts far from the coast, where yarn of British manufacture is more expensive than the material they can raise on their own soil. In 1890 larger quantities of Egyptian cotton were imported by the Government to encourage the cultivation of the plant.\n\nof cotton, and the samples obtained were valued at a higher figure than any previously received from West Africa. The seed has been distributed throughout the Colony, but the want of the means of transport militate against its cultivation on a scale beyond sufficient to supply local wants.\n\nSeveral coffee and cocoa plantations have recently been started, and are likely to be attended with success and profit to the owners. Many valuable fibre plants are indigenous. Attempts have been made to develop an industry in African piassava fibre, but not as yet with success. The kola tree, the nuts of which combine the best qualities of coffee and cocoa, is indigenous to the country.

In doing this, one such impediment stands out in strong relief; while, in consequence of the rapid change now taking place in the mode of conducting the business of this country with West Africa, we feel convinced that it is only necessary we should throw a strong and just light upon it to lead to its speedy removal. This impediment is the rate of freight on cotton from West African countries to England. At the first glance it may be thought by the owners of steam and sailing ships trading with Africa that we are premature in mooting the subject of a reduction in the rates of freight on cotton. It may be urged by them that these rates have undergone a reduction of 50 per cent., and their first impulse will no doubt be to say that it is preposterous to expect they can be still further reduced. It is true, thanks to the British and African Steam Navigation Company, that the rate of freight on cotton is now 3d. per pound instead of 1¼d. per pound, as it was in the days of steam monopoly by the African Steamship Company; but, at the same time, it is equally true that the rate of 3d. per pound is still too high a rate for the products of an industry that needs to be nursed and encouraged, and is consequently an impediment to that increase in the growth of cotton in West Africa which is so desirable for the progress of the African countries and the interests of Great Britain. Only those who, thirsting for African advancement, were watching the onward march of African agricultural industry, were sensible of the great impediment to the cotton culture which 1¼d. per pound freight on cotton to England placed in its way. It was a grievous error of the African Steamship Company to impose such a freight on cotton. The earliest efforts made in cotton culture for exportation, under the munificent donation of Miss Burdett Coutts so ably applied by Mr. Thomas Clegg, of Manchester, had established that cotton might be made in the course of time to figure largely in the exports of West Africa; that soil and climate favoured its growth, and that the natives in certain districts were willing to cultivate it for foreign markets. But 1¼d. per pound freight to Liverpool was a frightful obstacle, and the rate of progress was very slow until the disastrous civil war in America raised the price of New Orleans cotton from 5d. to above 2s. per pound. The African cotton from the Egba Countries is not much inferior to the New Orleans; it therefore approximated in value to the latter in the British markets, and the high price gave a stimulus to the African cotton industry which enabled it to triumph over the 1¼d. obstacle. Prices receded after the termination of the American war, but until lately they have been such as still to allow the production in Africa to progress, notwithstanding the 1¼d. and, later, as at present, 3d. freight. But the joint influence, temporarily of the European war, and, we believe permanently, of increased production in the United States, with the opening of new facilities of supply from India to England, via the Suez Canal, has caused a rapid fall in prices during the last few months, a fall which seems to point unmistakeably to prices somewhat similar to those which ruled immediately before the American struggle. We do not hesitate to say that this change of circumstance necessitates a change of rate of freight on cotton from Africa to England—necessitates it both in the interests of Africa and of the steam companies themselves. We are convinced that in what we are about to ask we are consulting their best interests. The interests of conveyers of produce from the Coast cannot be dissociated from those of the producers and traders. The African Steam Company did not see this heretofore; monopoly often creates blindness; but better counsels now prevail, a clearer sight has now been given, and we expect to see the now friendly rivals, the two great Steamship Companies, carefully watching the rise of any new agricultural industry in the African countries, and fostering and giving impetus to it by low rates of freight for the new product in the infancy of production. There are only three of the West African exports that depend entirely on what may be strictly called agricultural industry. These are ground-nuts, ginger, and cotton. The first of these has already established itself as a great staple, and may therefore be placed, more or less, although it has now a growing competition with the East Indies and other countries, in the same category with the grand staple, palm-oil, which may be left to take care of itself without any fear of prejudice thereby resulting to it. But cotton requires, demands, the nursing care of the shipowners. It has not, like palm-oil, a monopoly in European markets; it has to struggle against the organised production in America, the East Indies, Egypt, and other countries where a large capital and great facilities of transit, together with all the economising appliances which large capital only can command, give it great advantages. Under these circumstances it is to the interest, as we have before said, of this country, of the steam companies, and of Africa, that it should be treated with exceptional tenderness. And as the African advocate and guardian we earnestly ask this of them. We want to see this cotton industry so important to Great Britain, greatly and rapidly developed in the Egba, Yoruba, and Volta Countries. The latter, whenever a permanent pacification takes place, by the country becoming secured against Ashantee inroads, may be made a large cotton producer. Mr. J. C. Brandt, and one or two other Accra men, gave the first impulse, we believe, in Krepee, during the American war, and the German missionary traders followed profitably in the same path. The Ashantee invasion has for a time greatly impaired this industry, but there is every reason why, with so industrious a people as the Krepees, and good soil and climate, there should be a large exportation via the River Volta from Krepee, if the Steam Companies act on our suggestion. And we are not asking them to make any great present sacrifice to their own future and Africa's permanent interests. We are not going to ask them to bring cotton from Lagos or the Volta or Accra, to Liverpool, at freights lower than the average paid for cotton of other countries to that port. American cotton pays 7-16ths per pound freight by steamers from New York, or 3-16ths per pound by fast-sailing ships; African, even at the now reduced rates, pays 3d. per pound freight equally by the steamships and by those, for the most part, tubs of sailing ships, which manage to take three or four months, at best, to make the voyage. We are only asking them to do what is just and reasonable, and what will be to their own advantage in the long run."", 'last_edit_date': '1870-10-24', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_10_1870#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EGYPTIAN PROGRESS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The remark so often heard in Parliament as to the protection of the interests of England usually betrays a selfishness which would give very little consideration to the interests of other countries.

The figures given relate mainly to the port of Alexandria in 1880. The total value of the exports was slightly less than in 1879, arising not from any deficiency in the crops, but from the desire of the cotton growers to hold their stock, which their easy circumstances enabled them to do. The proportion of exports sent to England was greater than in the previous year by nearly 70 per cent. on the whole. The increasing prosperity of the fellaheen was shown more markedly by the increase in the imports, which exceeded those of 1879 by 23 per cent. The nature of the increases is especially encouraging. It was in coal, for the greater use of machinery for irrigation purposes, and in machinery, which the fellaheen themselves imported from Great Britain to the extent of 80 per cent. more than in the previous year. They have been enabled to do this by the rapid rise of banks and other establishments which advance money at comparatively low rates, and so release the peasants from their subjection to the usurer of former times. The Chairman of the Bank of Egypt the other day complained that the competition among banks in that country prevents high profits being realised; and this state of things operates to the advantage of the Egyptian agriculturists, who, since the days of Joseph, have made their land the granary of the Old World. Experiments have been made in the growth of jute, and, although they have been on a small scale, and accompanied by conscious mistakes, the produce per acre was found to be equal, and the price realised for it in Scotland higher than the produce and price of the jute of Bengal.

Circumstances have hitherto prevented my doing so, and I should perhaps have deferred writing about it at present, from the conviction that the materials at my command are insufficient to enable me to give you a report such as a matter of so great importance demands. Considering, however, that you have always more articles for your valuable journal than your space will allow you to publish, I shall try to give you multum in parvo. It has been one of the great aims of the African Times, from its formation, to point out to the rising generation of Africa the fact, that the great wealth of a country depends upon the amount of its agricultural products; and that the immense riches of Africa can never be developed unless its people put their shoulders to the wheel, and perform their part. You have seized upon every occasion to point out the immense advantages to be derived from a systematic pursuit of agriculture, and you have also particularised important and fertile soils at points which might be taken as nuclei, for operation. For instance, you have thus singled out Quiah, at Sierra Leone; the interior countries of the Gold Coast; the lands on the banks of the several rivers on the country of Yoruba, as well as those of the Niger, the mother river of Western Africa, and the great high road to its central territories. At Sierra Leone, the yearly burning of its fields; the excessive amount of iron in the composition of its soil—especially the Peroxide; the practice of upturning that soil yearly from the time of the formation of the colony for sowing purposes, without any external assistance by manure; the imperfect knowledge of the science of agriculture and of chemistry by the farmers, which teaches that the difference in the inorganic ingredients of plants leads them to select different inorganic materials from the soil, and therefore that rotation of crops is essential where manures cannot be obtained—have led its soil to be rightly pronounced as not the most fit for agricultural pursuits. It is therefore highly pleasing to find that his Excellency Governor Blackall is using his influence to popularise the subject amongst the young men of Sierra Leone, and to point out to them the fertile region of Quiah. The lecture lately delivered by the Rev. George Nicol, on the agriculture of that colony, ought to be regarded as a vade mecum for every one. The lands bordering the sea on the Gold Coast are dry and arid, and contain throughout the year but very little moisture. They are rich in phosphate and other inorganic matters, but the uncertainty of rain consequent on the geographic position of the lands forms, in the absence of irrigation, a great barrier to planters. It is to the interior we must therefore look for a field of effectual agricultural operations. The inhabitants of the Eastern Districts, through the indefatigable exertions of the Basle missionaries and Mr. Freeman, are now becoming alive to the advantages of agriculture, and every man of consequence is devoting the best portion of his time to it. In the interior of Cape Coast, or the central portion of the Gold Coast Government, the soil is admirably adapted for sowing any kind of crops. The best is to be found in the regions bordering on the Ashantee frontiers or that of the Fanti. It is there excellent for almost every kind of vegetable, and is rich in inorganic ingredients. It is an argillaceous superficial loam, intermixed with a species of sand formed by the disintegration of quartzose and felspathic rocks. The river communication should make this part the fulcrum for agricultural pursuits. It is needless for me to say a word on the fertility of the Yoruba and Niger soils, as all history goes to prove that they are rich in productive materials.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-04-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1864#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Agriculture on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In a very interesting report on economic agriculture on the Gold Coast, issued from the Colonial Office, some noteworthy information relating to the cultivation of cotton in that part of West Africa is included. Although cotton grows wild in the colony it is almost neglected, except in the Volta district, where Messrs. F. & A. Swanzy have plantations. The quantity exported is extremely small. This wild cotton appears to be of the Brazilian variety, of good colour, but short in staple. For cultivation on a large scale it would be advisable to introduce Egyptian seed or some of the better American varieties. Messrs. Swanzy use Egyptian. Besides the fibre, the seeds of the plant may be made a source of profit, either by exporting them as they are or by the expression and exportation of the oil which they contain. Cotton is largely cultivated in the country behind Kumasi, and the yarn worked up into cloth in the country. The silk-cotton tree yields a fibre which is largely imported into Holland from the Indian Archipelago under the name of kapok, and is used for stuffing furniture. The enormous number of silk-cotton trees in the colony would yield a plentiful supply if the people found it worth collecting and exporting, and the timber is used for making fishing canoes.\n\nRice also might be made an important crop on the Gold Coast. It is grown in the Axim and Quittah districts. In the former district a red variety is grown in the marshy plains. It is large, soft-grained, and sweet, resembling the Sierra Leone rice. In the Quittah district an upland sort is grown, and forms the staple food of the inhabitants.

The textbook highlights the emergence of indigenous churches and religious movements, such as Ethiopianism and independent African churches, which emphasize local leadership and self-governance, aligning with the claim that religious transformation involves native Africans taking control of their spiritual and cultural destinies. It also discusses the role of traditional leaders in colonial governance, suggesting that local self-governance was significant, though often limited by colonial powers maintaining ultimate control. This complexity is echoed in the interplay between traditional and modern influences, indicating that governance and religious transformation are shaped by historical, cultural, and external factors. Meanwhile, The African Times articles support the claim by emphasizing the integration of educated natives into legislative bodies, as seen in Lagos and Sierra Leone, advocating for local self-governance to ensure prosperity and security. They highlight the success of native agency in religious transformation, particularly in Christian missions, where native leaders are crucial for effective evangelization and self-reliant church communities. The articles also discuss the challenges of imposing foreign governance systems and the need to respect local customs, exemplified by Governor Maclean's success through understanding native laws. However, they note challenges such as the slow progress in the Christianization of Sierra Leone, indicating that while inclusive leadership is essential, it faces difficulties.

Additionally, the text discusses the role of traditional leaders and chiefs in colonial governance, suggesting that local self-governance was a significant aspect of colonial administration, particularly under indirect rule.

Of particular relevance as we have seen already in some of the earlier chapters were the messianic movements which expressed indigenous ideologies as well as those which reflected Islamic and Christian ones. They were movements which were emancipatory in character, expressing what is essentially a universal phenomenon in situations in which communities had to express their dissatisfaction with their living conditions and a desire for regeneration. They represented an ideology competing against colonial› ism in so far as the latter represented a negation of indigenous culture and economic, social and psychological depression of the colonized. In the words of Lanternari, 'They reflect the anxieties and hopes of the groups that participate in them for a sudden and total transformation of their physical, social and psychological environment.' 16 Prominent examples of such movements in our period, some of whose activities have been discussed in Chapter 20 above, were Ethiopianism in South and East Africa, and the movement spearheaded by millenarian preachers in Southern and Central Africa, notably the Kitawala (African and Congo Watch Tower) with large following in the Rhodesias, spreading to the Congo (now Zaire) and Nyasaland (now Malawi); the Kimbanguist movement (founded in the Belgian Congo by Simon Kimbangu) with following in Belgian and French Congo and the neo-Kimbanguist Mission des Noirs founded in the Lower Congo by Simon-Pierre Mpadi. Otherwise known as the Khakists, the movement had influence among the population of French Congo and Oubangui-Chari (now Central African Republic). Some of these movements were inspired by their acceptance of Christianity but were disenchanted with the expression of the religion in the organized Church of the colonial societies. African nationalists who were anxious to preserve Africans against colonial oppression found the Church at best indifferent. They therefore broke away very much in the spirit of the Reformation which has been characteristic of the growth and spread of Christianity in many societies.

These included the creation of chancelleries to be managed by literate Africans to control diplomatic relations with Europeans and guide the external relations of the states; the reform of tax systems by the introduction of regulated taxes in place of tolls and tribute; and the improvement of the judicial system by the introduction of record-keeping and putting enacted laws into writing. 15"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': 'Nor is the \'traditional-modern\' polar model, with all its attendant implications of conflict and incompatibility, applicable to the entire spectrum of African experience of change under colonialism. There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world.

Cutting across the lineage system of non-centralized societies, a variety of integrative institutions developed in the religious, judicial and economic fields which could function as an overall framework of order or replace a disintegrating state-system.$^{25}$ The poro and similar associations in Upper Guinea, or various so-called 'secret societies' in the Cross river and equatorial forest areas of the Cameroons and Gabon are examples.

An ex-serviceman in the King's African Rifles, Mukasa gave expression to the unifying purpose of all these movements when he promised to work for the redemption of Africa at whatever personal risks.

The Sanüsiyya influence as an anticolonial force spread to parts of West Africa. The colonial authorities found Islamic movements like the Hamalliyya, the Tijaniyya, and Mouridiyya a constant threat to the security of the colonial system.\nThese Islamic movements provided a strong link among adherents who found themselves under different colonial regimes.

Its institutional expression was greatly affected by the new colonial order but its world view has persisted even among professed Muslims and Christians. The fact of religious pluralism created rivalries, competition and even conflict in many parts of Africa, but at the same time the opportunity for inter-religious dialogue was created.\nThe weakening of traditional religion also meant a corresponding weakening of many of the traditional social and political institutions which depended on it for their vitality and sanction.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Ethiopianism', 'content': 'From the views of these educated Africans, the level of scholarship and learning displayed in their writings, the sophistication of their argu› mentation, the bite of their logic and, finally, from the sheer volume of their articles, publications and correspondence, there is no doubt that a veritable intellectual revolution occurred in West Africa in particular and Africa in general.

They have all been most generously treated, admitted to the presence of the Queen, surrounded by all her officers, addressed kindly and encouragingly, as well as gratified by presents of cattle, &c., and are to-morrow to be entertained at a royal banquet at the palace. The affairs of the kingdom constitute now the business of the Government, in which Christians and Hovas are combined, promptitude and activity are everywhere apparent, and all parties are more careful in their public conduct. This state of things is not unfavourable to the Christians. The hereditary policy of the Hovas is \'Things as they have been;\' \'The wisdom of our ancestors cannot be surpassed.\' But so many innovations have turned out improvements and benefits, that the aim now seems to be to adopt what is good in the new, while retaining what they can of the old.

We deny this altogether. Sierra Leone does not really require troops except for swelling the pageant of Government; everything she wants in the military line she could locally raise under enlightened superintendence and could also pay for; her police force, which at present costs far too much, might be militarily organised, and would be all that she needs or is likely to need for protection other than naval. The Cape and Gold Coast settlements which have been informed that they must in future see to their own internal protection—need nothing more in a military form than some local disciplined corps to garrison the Castle and even Bathurst, where the military might be thought indispensable, would, we are convinced, soon be ten times more prosperous and secure than she is at present, if her Government was, as we have stated that it ought to be, in the hands of those whose interests require that they should cultivate friendly relations with the surrounding natives, and if a British gunboat were frequently to be seen in the Gambia waters. No—there is no reason, on the score of Imperial economy, that the British Government should abandon (or cede) any one of the West African settlements; to do so without having first organised good local self-government, by which order and the progress of Christian civilisation might be secured, would be a disgraceful outrage and wrong to mankind, and an insulting return to Almighty God of that talent of power which he bestowed, that as a Christian nation she might endeavour to extend the kingdom of his dear Son, to whom he has given all rule and dominion and power on earth, as in heaven.'}, {'id': 3359, 'article_title': 'Native Agency Important in the Work of Christianizing the Heathen', 'full_section_title': 'Native Agency Important in the Work of Christianizing the Heathen', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1877#article-12', 'issue_date': '01_08_1877', 'content': 'In an address delivered at the recent annual meeting of the Wesleyan Missionary Society, the Rev.

To begin with, the European is not on the same plane with those Eastern peoples, nor does he think and feel as they do. He may speak to them lovingly and tenderly as only lips moved by a heart burning with compassion can speak; but it is yet the voice of a stranger, not that of a familiar friend, a voice betraying a depth of tenderness; still it seems to come across a great chasm, an impassable gulf, and lacks that breath of homeliness which everybody can feel, yet none describe. Nobody is more painfully conscious of this than we are ourselves. The native must ever be more powerful than the European. They have trodden every step of the way from heathen darkness to Gospel light. Every trial is known to them by actual experience. Fellow feeling gives them power of truest sympathy. They can take the timid by the hand, and put a pressure in the grip, and a power in the glance, which will inspire with confidence—a pressure and a power the stranger can never learn.

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs. It shows nice powers of observation—great diligence—a clear appreciation of facts, and a mental daring that does not shrink from the great problems of the future of the various divisions of his race, on which the light of Christian civilisation is only now beginning to shine, and who are for the most part placed under circumstances most unfavourable to its increase. After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries. Showing us their actual condition, and exposing many errors of administration which are opposed to material development and social advancement, he views the whole in connexion with the resolutions of the late House of Commons Committee, 1865, recommending the preparing of the several people for self-government. He shows the great changes that must be induced and fostered to make such self-government possible, safe, or beneficial. Though he has evidently a deep and, we believe, a just faith in his race, he does not shut his eyes to any of the disadvantages of their actual position and the difficulties in the way of their progress toward Christianity, civilisation, and wealth. The book ought to be read and studied by all educated Africans, and we should like to see it have a large circulation in England, as we consider it calculated to arouse sympathies for Africa where they have never yet been felt, and to give them a vigorous impulse where they do already exist. Our space will not allow more at present, but we shall from time to time quote from and comment upon its contents. We cannot say it is perfect in style, but the faults are very venial ones, and such as we have no doubt an increased practice in writing will cause to disappear from those future works on this interesting subject of the West African Countries and Peoples which we hope to see from this author's pen.

In dealing with districts and races which have been only partially brought under the influence of European civilization and social custom, there can be no mistake more fatal in its ultimate results than attempting to impose a standard of right and wrong dependent upon principles which the native is altogether incapable of appreciating. And it is, therefore, most refreshing to notice that one of the conditions upon which the Charter recently granted to the National African Company (now the Royal Niger Company) was issued was that ""in the administration of justice regard shall be had to the customs and laws of the nation to which the parties belong."" This is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. It is generally admitted that of all the white officials who within recent years have held appointments on the West Coast of Africa there was not any one so successful in his administration as Governor Maclean. ""He is remembered"" (quoting from a recent number of the *Western Echo*) ""as a perfect adept at everything pertaining to government,"" for with only a very small armed force and a total revenue of less than £4,000 per annum, he managed to maintain peace both within and without the borders of his district. Maclean\'s great influence over the natives was in no small degree attributable to the intimate and appreciative knowledge of the local laws and native customs which he gained during the time he occupied the post of Judicial Assessor, as he found out that among the natives there was a complete and well-understood system of laws connected with both personal property and land, which system, be it remembered, had been handed down, generation after generation, from time immemorial, and was without doubt much better suited to the native understanding than the comparatively modern and elaborate English system of jurisprudence, which, too, is ever varying in its details at least. What is needed to give the native of the West Coast a fair chance of social and domestic improvement, is a frank recognition of his own laws and customs—so far, at least, as they are not repugnant to international law and the best interests of humanity—together with a gradual reduction of the present large and expensive official establishments, and a corresponding lightening of the burdens of taxation, and an assimilation of import and export duties.

Liberia has been a black republic for forty years; Sierra Leone has been a negro colony for a century; and it cannot be denied that each of these communities has made very gratifying progress. Yet, upon Dr. Blyden's own showing, that progress has been but partial, he still has to complain of his countrymen's imitativeness and lack of backbone. The responsibility for this, undoubtedly, rests to some extent upon the unsuitable character of the education which the civilized negroes have received; but it is more to the purpose to remember that three generations is a very brief period in the development of a pagan people. How slow the work of civilization in Liberia has been may be seen from the fact that, whereas there are some twenty thousand Christian negroes in the republic, there are more than a million who are pagans. And now we inevitably come to the primary question of all: whether or not the presumed racial inferiority of the negro is proved. Dr. Blyden pleads eloquently for his fellows, and triumphantly asks: How could an inferior race have produced Toussaint L'Ouverture? The question is not unnatural, but it is far from logical. The matter, as it fashions itself to us, is, and is likely to remain for a long time to come, an open one. The negro has, as yet, enjoyed no sufficient opportunity of proving either his mental equality with or his inferiority to the white. The experience of Sierra Leone and Liberia, so far as it has gone, has been in his favour; what we know of his moral history in that other black republic, Hayti, and in the United States, is at the best negative. As time goes on, the question, which is far more momentous than would appear to the unthinking, will settle itself. Emigration from America to Liberia, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, is proceeding satisfactorily; and Dr. Blyden states that 200,000 negroes in the United States are prepared to return to the land of their fathers. But colonization by private effort is, at the best, exceedingly slow; and in this instance it is perhaps well that it is so, since the gradual settlement of Liberia is far more likely to provide material for a strong and healthy State than a hasty rush would be. Social reformers for many a year to come will watch the experiment, as they have watched it in the past, with keen interest. The chief danger lies, as Dr. Blyden constantly points out, in the tendency to Europeanize the negro—to supersede customs and practices which are useful and often necessary in Africa by customs utterly out of place there. The ill-directed zeal of some of the less reflective missionaries has, no doubt, been to blame for some of this; but there is, we fancy, very little to complain of upon this head now. Let it be once proved beyond all doubt that negroes can found flourishing colonies, can develop the limitless resources of the continent which has been the cradle of their race; and, above all, that they can govern themselves prudently and self-reliantly,—and there will open up before the black man the assurance of a future as splendid and far-reaching as any that ever presented itself to a white conqueror."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1887#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.623, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'POLITICAL FUTURE OF WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""regards the countries of West Africa of which we have been now writing; but we thought this might be postponed without injury.

Professor Crummel, in his book on ""The Future of Africa,"" asserts ""Mohammedanism is rapidly and peaceably spreading through all the tribes of Western Africa."" Sir Richard Burton affirms that ""Mohammedans alone make proselytes in Africa."" Dr. Blyden, a full-blooded Christian negro, recently the Liberian Minister at the Court of St. James, is an unexceptional witness. In his recent work entitled ""Christianity, Islam, and the Negro Race,"" he says that in Western Africa ""Mohammedanism is rapidly superseding Paganism. The Arab missionaries in the interior go about without purse or scrip, and disseminate their religion by quietly teaching the Koran. In this way, silently and unobtrusively, they are causing princes to become obedient disciples and zealous propagators of Islam."" These Moslem missionaries go from town to town and village to village, simply as the bearers of God\'s truth. They take their mats or their skins and their manuscripts, and are followed by their pupils, who in every new Pagan town form the nucleus of a school and congregation. These preachers are the receivers, not the dispensers, of charity. In the interior missionaries are to be met from Kairwan, Cairo, Morocco, dependent for their food upon those whom they instructed. As to the results of this noiseless propaganda of these devoted men, Professor Blyden tell us that ""between Sierra Leone and Egypt the Mohammedans are the only great intellectual, moral, and commercial power. . . . Islam has taken possession of and shaped the social, political, and religious life of the most intelligent tribes. . . . No one can travel any distance in the interior without finding that Islam is the ruling influence."" ""From Senegal to Lagos, over 2,000 miles, there is scarcely an important town where there are not at least one mosque and active representatives of Islam."" ""Throughout Mohammedan Africa education is compulsory. A man might now travel across the Continent from Sierra Leone to Cairo, or in another direction from Lagos to Tripoli, sleeping in a village every night, except in the Sahara, and in every village he would find a school."" The statements of Mr. Bosworth Smith are to the same effect. He says, ""At this day Mohammedan missionaries are meeting everywhere with a marked success which is denied our own.""

In both cases the Arab traders were the instigators, though in the latter case they seem to have had matters simplified for them by the action of the German East African and Imperial authorities. If it be true that the German ships have occasionally been guilty of promiscuously shelling the coast, ""simply to overawe the natives,"" we can hardly wonder at the influence obtained by these Arab traders. In the ordinary way there is not much reason for this alliance between the natives and the Arabs—as the intercourse of the latter is generally confined to kidnapping and enslaving the former. But the presence of a common enemy is sure to drive them into alliance together. And let us remember the native mind does not grasp the difference between one European power and another. It is not in the interests of the Arab to enlighten them—on the contrary, it is clearly to his advantage to persuade them that all Europeans are bent upon their destruction. The Arab influence in East Africa is already immense. The chief obstacle to its further development lies in the hostility of the native tribes, who have trusted Europeans in preference, because they found that these have been just and considerate; but according to latest accounts, the Germans seem bent upon changing all this, and forcing the natives to make common cause with the Arabs. Their efforts at peaceful colonisation will surely fail in exact proportion to their success in this enterprise.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-03-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_03_1889#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'West Africa: Present and Future', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Our missions in West Africa,"" says this Society, ""are as yet confined to the seaboard. Beginning at the most northern of these stations, we may, in a sentence or two, trace them round the coast to the River Niger, and the new stations in that region. The Gambia settlement stands at the mouth, and on either bank of the River Gambia, consisting of the Island of St. Mary, British Combo, Albreda, and Macarthy\'s Island. The Island of St. Mary is a mere sand-bank, about three and a quarter miles long by one and a half broad, and was purchased by our Government from the King of Combo. Macarthy\'s Island stands in the centre of the River Gambia, and is about 150 miles from the sea. This was acquired in 1834, and contains about nine square miles; it is very fertile, and for a great part of the year is less unhealthy than the seaboard stations. The populations of this British Settlement in 1881 were returned as follows: Bathurst, 6,138; British Barra, 4,047; British Combo, 3,057; Macarthy\'s Island, 908; total, 14,150. In 1871 there were 14,190; decrease in ten years, 40. There is an Administrator of the Government, with a council and judicial and revenue departments. The revenue in 1880 was £23,340. Our mission is chiefly confined to the settlement area. Sierra Leone is a regularly constituted British settlement with legislative and executive councils, and other appliances of government fiscal and judicial, &c. This is situated 447 miles to the south of the Gambia. In Sierra Leone African human nature has gone through some most remarkable processes of mental, social, and moral development. Never was such a mosaic of tribes and languages as we find here. Many hopes were indulged that those liberated captives would become pioneers of civilisation to their several tribes from whom they had been kidnapped. Upwards of a hundred dialects find their representatives here. The English language is fast superseding all these divergent African dialects, and all public business and religious services are conducted in English. The population in 1881 was 60,516. There are some very interesting efforts being made to extend the mission work into the interior. The Limbah country has opened its heart to receive our agents, and here a hopeful commencement has been made. There is scope for indefinite expansion. Travelling south 120 miles from Sierra Leone we come to British Sherbro\', a place of great commercial activity, ceded to Britain by the native chiefs in 1862, having a population of 4,400. Here again there is scope for a great work. Leaving Sherbro\' and passing Liberia, the republic of negro emigrants from America, where a great problem is in process of solution, we come to the Gold Coast Colony, some 870 miles from Sierra Leone, constituted by royal charter in 1874, comprising the British settlements on the Gold Coast and at Lagos. Here we meet with crowning missionary facts and grand proofs of success as the reward of patient toil, with indefinite regions to the north and east for aggressive culture. Here we have many seaboard towns backed by Ashantee and its teeming populations. Continuing the voyage along the coast, we arrive at Lagos, another advance post and valuable base for aggressive operations. This territory was ceded to Britain in 1861 by the then King, and was constituted a British settlement in 1866. In the country of Dahomey, with its antecedents and present claims, we have a very wonderful sphere for real missionary aggression. These are some of the old grounds, where foreign cupidity and native barbarity reigned rampant for generations. Our own missions on the coast have not been powerless, much progress having been made in educational and church interests. . . . With native church membership of 13,190, and a native ministry numbering 30, and with a history stretching over 70 years, it does seem that the morn is breaking when the Western Coast missions should prepare themselves for some form of more complete self-government. Another problem is the successful conduct and management of a vigorous pioneer work under the restraints which the climate imposes. Dr. Livingstone\'s great desire for Eastern Central Africa was to discover some mountain zone or plateau offering conditions favourable to the founding of an English colony; and, failing that, then the development of a thoroughly missionary spirit in the natives themselves. . . . There is hope for Africa. There never was a case in which the Christian toiler had greater need of long, patient waiting for the early and the latter rains. God is at work most manifestly, notwithstanding the perplexities and alarming destructions of Egypt and the vast interior of the Soudan, notwithstanding the convulsions which are shaking Africa from Alexandria to Zululand.

In the first place, other colonization societies grew out of the original one and founded three more settlements, at Bassa Cove, Sinoe and Cape Palmas: the last, named Maryland, being incorporated in the country's territory only in 1856. There was self-government in the sense that the American societies were subordinated to the settlements and not the other way round. The inhabitants showed courage in an environment that was hostile both ecologically and politically. The land was not very fertile, and had been worked by archaic methods. There was no business and no capital, and free men's labour was expensive. But there were engineers who knew how to build in concrete. The settlements on the coast drove out the slavetraders and stopped the trade. The aim of philanthropists and colonizers was achieved. The second factor was the personal qualities of the people in charge. Their background was Anglican and English-speaking; they were well fitted for the life they had chosen, but they were realists; and they planted the seeds of a new nation. The constitution that Thomas Buchanan brought from the USA in 1839 was remodelled to suit the specific case of Liberia. John B. Russwurm, the Governor of Maryland from 1836 to 1851, brought into being a land which racialism could not reach. J.J.

Barclay, who succeeded President King, decided to implement the recommendations of the League. Accordingly, the Liberian Legislature passed several Acts between December 1930 and May 1931 which abolished the export of labour, pawning and domestic slavery; substituted voluntary communal labour on public works for forced labour; reopened the entire Liberian hinterland to foreign traders, and reorganized the hinterland administra› tion into three provinces with provincial and subordinate district com› missioners and paramount chiefs. 89 In spite of those reforms - which, of course, the Liberian government could not effectively or willingly implement in their entirety - Britain and the United States refused to recognize the Barclay administration and con› ducted their affairs in Liberia through their respective chargØs d'affaires.

Thereafter, up to about 1906, over 18000 New World Africans mostly aided by the ACS settled, annually, in Liberia in congeries of over thirty towns close to the Atlantic littoral on land obtained by the ACS or the Liberian government from the African chiefs of the region. Almost all of them were Afro-Americans, but at least 400 were Afro-West Indians from Barbados who emigrated in 1865 and settled together at Crozierville, 13 km inland from Monrovia. Over 5000 Recaptives - mostly from the Congo region - were also settled, particularly between 1844 and 1863, initially in the care of the Americo-Liberians as the New World African settlers and their descendants were collectively designated. 4\nNeeding land for farming, trade, and for building a great nation, and faced with some competition from the British and the French seeking land to build trading factories and military stations, the Americo-Liberians greatly expanded Liberia's territory from the few isolated points on the coast initially leased to them by African chiefs.

Throughout the nineteenth century, Americo-Liberians' policy was to assimilate the indigenous Africans culturally and politically by 'civilizing' and Christianizing them, and giving them equal rights with the settlers. Although this was achieved to some extent with the Recaptives (who were much less numerous than the settlers), the Americo-Liberians, mindful of their own privileged position, main› tained tight political control over Liberia by restricting political participa› tion of even those indigenous Africans who were educated. Only very few of them were given the franchise on an equal footing with the AmericoLiberians (although these might themselves be illiterate and poor). The main indigenous African representation (mostly of the coastal Africans) in the Liberian Legislature as from 1875 consisted of African chiefs designated 'referees' (or 'delegates'), after their chiefdoms had paid an annual 'delegate fee' of $100 to the Liberian government. As the delegates 'spoke' through an interpreter solely on ethnic matters and could not vote, they had very little influence on government policy.$^{8}$ Hence both the educated Africans and the chiefs resented their restricted representation. Furthermore the Liberian government sought to maximize its import and export duties and other levies on trade and shipping which constituted its main sources of revenue. To facilitate collection and control of the external trade by Americo-Liberian merchants, from 1839 the government restricted foreign merchants to trade at only six Americo-Liberian portsof-entry. The restrictions and levies alienated both the foreign merchants who resented them, and the indigenous African chiefs who had formerly controlled the external trade and levied the dues. Often, the foreign merchants and chiefs combined to resist or defy the trade restrictions and levies, or to appeal to European states to intervene on their behalf. Thus, at various times during the nineteenth century, the Vai, Kru and Grebo of the Liberian coast put up an armed resistance to Liberian government impositions on their trade. 9"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': 'The outcome of the Scramble and partition for Liberia and Ethiopia', 'content': ""Such European intervention in Liberia had far-reaching effects on Liberian politics and society.

But for the active intervention of the United States, thanks to the activities of the American Minister Resident in Monrovia, Ernest Lyon, an Afro-American thoroughly in sympathy with Liberia and her leaders' anxiety to obtain American support from 1909 onwards, there is no doubt that Liberia would have fallen victim to the other imperial powers.\nNever at any time was Ethiopia subjected to such persistent intervention by the European imperial powers in her internal affairs. On the contrary, thanks to the Adowa victory, she was accorded every respect and accepted into the comity of nations more or less as an equal during the period that Liberia was virtually under the siege of the imperial powers.

Traditional African communal labour was to replace forced labour for public works; the indigenous Liberians were to be granted an undisputed ownership of their lands, the authority and dignity of the African chiefs were to be upheld by the Liberian government, and the education of the indigenous Liberians and the means of communication with the Liberian hinterland were to be improved. The hinterland was to be divided into three provinces to be administered by foreign provincial and deputy commissioners under whom would be Liberian county super› intendents and district commissioners.

There is only one course, therefore, to pursue, which is, to draw these natives and their territories into the State by a wise and conciliatory Administration—by making the natives partakers of the benefits of free institutions, admitting their educated men to a share in all the rights and privileges and emoluments of the Republic, and repressing with a just severity such actions of the Cape Palmas people as have been reasonably enough complained of by the Gedeboes. The difficulty is for Liberia to do all that is really necessary with the very limited public resources that her Government can command.

It had no legal existence among the nations. This fact was made apparent by the refusal of foreign ships to pay the duties imposed by its Legislature. The natives of the coast continued to harass it in consequence of its opposition to the slave trade, until the new State found itself between an upper and a nether millstone. Governor Roberts applied himself to overcome each difficulty in turn. He succeeded in persuading the native chiefs to appreciate the advantages of civilisation, and a number were induced to federate for the purpose of abolishing slavery and introducing orderly administration within their borders. The federated body shortly afterwards entered the colony, and in 1845 the territory of the Kroomen was annexed by friendly treaty, thus adding a third county, under the name of Sinou, to the two which already existed. The colony now extended to Grand Sesters. Maryland also widened the area of her administration, and the entire coast was occupied from Cape Mount to San Pedro.

Liberia had no position except as a dependency of the United States, and the prejudice against colour in America caused that Government to give only lukewarm support to the African colony. If it were to exist at all, it was necessary that it should assert its individuality and claim for itself the rights which were denied to it. Under these circumstances the American Colonisation Society came to the resolution to abandon all rights over its protégé and advised it to take its fate boldly into its own hands.

President Roberts, who undertook a tour through Europe for the purpose of obtaining the recognition of the Powers, was well received in England, and was not only able to conclude a commercial treaty, but was accepted as an ally in the prosecution of the campaign against the slave trade on the West African coast, and was presented with a gunboat to enable him to carry on the repression of the traffic in Liberian waters. He, in 1849, took an active part in an expedition of the Powers against the slade traders, who had their headquarters in the northern territory lying between Liberia and Sierra Leone. It was felt that if the whole coast could be held under anti-slavery supervision the trade might be extirpated, and in 1850 the West Coast territory to Cape Turner was purchased from the owners and placed under the guardianship of Liberia. Robertsport was founded this year, and commemorates the name of the President. The population of the Republic was rapidly increasing, her territory was extended towards the interior by treaties with the chiefs, and in 1857 the colony of Maryland was by its own request annexed.

The first independent civilized African State on the West Coast, she occupies a position of great honour and usefulness. With institutions framed on the model of those of the United States of America, she stands out boldly before the world asserting and proving that there is no lack of natural ability in the civilized African to work the machinery of free institutions. Her President, her judges, her learned professors, are Christian Africans; no white man holds any political position in the country; the nation is essentially negro, and is so far from feeling any need of European or American aid in carrying on the various departments of her government, that she does more than discourage, she prohibits the permanent settlement of white men within her borders. They may come there for purposes of trade, but they are not permitted to acquire landed property; African she is, and exclusively African she is determined to remain. The enemies and libellers of the African race not unfrequently point to Liberia with contempt and ridicule, because she has not obtained in infancy the development of manhood; because, having no capital but what has been created by the industry of her own people, she is not able to undertake those works of civilization which are so much needed for the rapid development of her great natural resources; because, amid the abundant elements of wealth existing in her rich tropical fertility, and with her capability of producing so many objects that Europe requires and is compelled to seek even at the opposite side of the world, her Government is poor, and her revenue insufficient, without constant patriotic self-denial on the part of her principal citizens, for the support of those establishments indispensable to a free Christian State, which includes within her borders a native heathen population more than twenty times exceeding in number the civilized population of which the State really consists. But so far from there being anything in her public condition to justify contempt and ridicule such as our ignorantly-learned anthropologists would heap upon her and her people, every impartial man will find cause in her for wonder and felicitation that a mere handful of people brought to the African Coast from the degrading servitude of the late Slave States of the great American Republic should have fallen into so few errors, and have made such rapid progress. For it must be especially borne in mind that no comparison between Liberia and an English colony would be fair. An English colony, however small the number of emigrants and their descendants may be, is constantly and from its very birth receiving assistance from realized British capital. But the African emigrants from the United States to Liberia have not had any such resources at their back. They or their fathers have been slaves; and their only means of reaching Liberia was by the gift of a free passage, with six months free support after arrival, by the Colonization Society which founded this refuge for emancipated slaves on the West Coast of Africa. There have been no African Crusoes to help to build up this African Republic; the wealth, whatever it may be, within her is only the surplus of what her own people have created, over and above what they required for their own support. The progress thus made must necessarily be slow in comparison with that of an English colony anywhere, although it may be, as it has been in reality, rapid when viewed only in connexion with the elements available for promoting it. But we hope and believe that the time is now approaching when that progress will be greatly stimulated. Liberia, formed of American Africans, strongly imbued with the Republican principles so extreme in the American people, is not likely to attract any new elements of wealth and population from any other country than that from which its present civilized population has been derived. Ardently desiring as we do to see a rapid advance in Liberia, we rejoiced when we foresaw, as an inevitable consequence of the civil war in the United States, an increased emigration of emancipated Africans from those states to Liberia. The extreme change in the position of the late slaves in America, who have been so suddenly elevated from a debasing bondage, from a condition in which they were estimated rather as beasts than as men, to the full privileges of citizenship, political as well as social, has, however, retarded that movement toward Africa which would otherwise have impelled large numbers of the emancipated to Liberia. Still, the desire to become citizens of an exclusively African Republic, and that in Africa, has been gradually spreading in America, and the Colonization Society, who sent a shipload of emigrants in November last, and another in May, will despatch their ship again in November next with a further addition of some 800 for the African Republic. From the published statements of the society we have reason to believe that 4,000 or 5,000 emigrants might have been sent to Liberia during the present year, instead of some 1,500, had the society been in possession of the requisite funds. We must express our hope that the Colonization Society will be able to obtain all the money it may require to realize the spontaneous desires of late American slaves to become Liberian citizens. It is only by a large increase in her civilized industrial population that Liberia can make rapid progress in production and wealth. She is limited to this source of increase by the elements of which she is composed, by the nature of her institutions, and the strong peculiarities of her people; and all who are desirous of seeing the West Coast countries and their peoples emerge from their barbarism and degradation and come within the sphere of Christian civilizing influences should assist the Colonization Society of the United States in conveying emigrants to Liberia. We had hoped that before 1870 her civilized population would there be increased to at least 50,000. She could with the assistance rendered by the society for six months after the arrival of the emigrants in Liberia have very well established the requisite number, or even a greater number, within her borders before that period could they have been sent to her; and such an addition to her civilized labourers on her coasts and the rich lands of her navigable rivers would, we are convinced, soon give to the carping libellers of the African race new and forcible evidence of the just claim of the African to the rights and sympathies of a common brotherhood with the hitherto more favoured European.', 'last_edit_date': '1867-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1867#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TREATY OF PEACE BETWEEN LIBERIA AND THE NATIVES LATELY AT WAR WITH THE REPUBLIC.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Treaty of Peace between the Government of the Republic of Liberia and the following Tribes, representing the Gedebo Re-united Kingdom, Cape Palmas, Rocktown, Middletown, Half Gravay, Whole Gravay, Half Cavalla, Whole Cavalla, and Fishtown.*\n\nWhereas there has existed between the tribes above mentioned and the Government of the Republic of Liberia bitter feelings, which have resulted in war; and whereas it is to the best interests of the parties aforesaid that peace and harmony should prevail: Therefore, the tribes aforesaid, as represented by King Yude Weah, Gbudi Saba, Tane Poo, Hwhweye Dodo, Hemie Nwanebuo, Me Hne, Tibla Foda, and Gido Nemle, Chiefs of the tribes aforesaid, of the first part, and the Government of the Republic of Liberia, as represented by his Excellency President James S.

We need not expatiate on the pleasure with which we received it. We have ever taken so warm an interest in the welfare of this African Republic, that we were greatly grieved at the late hostilities between it and those native Coast tribes whose identification with it is so essential to the development of its resources and the spread of Christian civilization in that part of Africa. We tender our sincere congratulations to its new President, the Hon. James S. Payne, who only entered upon his Presidential duties in January last, at this early accomplishment of an object which the perusal of his report as Special Commissioner to Cape Palmas last year convinced us he had deeply at heart. We give on another page the text of the Treaty, which was made under the friendly auspices of the Commander of the U.S. steam ship-of-war, the Alaska. The admittance of all educated members of those Coast tribes as citizens of the Republic, with the same rights and privileges as the Americo-Liberians, which is provided for and urged upon them in this Treaty of Peace, is one important step in the right direction pointed out in our last number. The incorporation of the native tribes everywhere within the territories claimed by the Republic, by giving the full rights of citizenship to every educated and Christianized man belonging to them, was so absolutely indispensable to the progress and permanent welfare of Liberia, that we can only wonder it has been so long delayed. If the only way in which it could be brought about was through the late hostilities between the Liberian Government and the Grebo tribes, we can no longer regret that such hostilities should have disturbed for a time the dangerous peace of the Republic, although they must have been a burthen to the State which its very limited resources made it very ill able to bear. In offering these our sincere congratulations, we feel it to be our duty to express at the same time our earnest hope that the President, and his Legislature now assembled at Monrovia, will see that it is advisable to follow up this beginning of a new policy by a revision of those Articles of the Liberian Constitution that have hitherto prevented the introduction of the European capital of which the infant Republic has so much need. Fortified as Liberia is by the recognition which has been given to it by the United States of America and all the European Powers, it is entitled to feel that confidence in its own stability, and in the friendship of all foreign States, which will justify it in opening its fertile lands and navigable rivers to the wealth and enterprise of Europeans, with only such political restrictions as may be deemed necessary to prevent their interfering in its Legislature or Government. With this reservation, Liberia will do well to open its arms to that wealth and enterprise which, by the development of its great resources, would within a very few years add greatly to the public revenues, and enable it as a State to accomplish works and obtain a position which would not be otherwise obtainable by it, save after many, many years of painful struggles and humiliations. Liberia has now nothing to fear from the influx of Europeans with capital; it has everything to fear if it continues to exclude what is really necessary to a prosperous existence.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE WAR IN LIBERIA.—DEATH OF THE LATE PRESIDENT, THE HON.

We have read it attentively, but we cannot find in it that dependable rectification of errors in King Weah’s statement, published by us last month, which we had looked for. Having received constant and minute intelligence from Cape Palmas, from the period of the advent of the Liberian Commissioner there, we discover that there are important omissions in the Report; nor are we at all satisfied that King Weah’s statements are incorrect as regards either of the two great points—viz., the commencement of warlike operations and the territorial claims. We are surprised at the failure of the Report on these points, because, if there be one thing more than another in which the public men in Liberia have excelled, it has been in the drawing up of their Reports, Presidential Messages, and other State documents; and still more surprised, because many portions of the Report are written with a most charming air of sincerity and good feeling, becoming the character and position of the Commissioner. The Commissioner states that there was a warlike demonstration of the natives on the 10th of August, and that on the following day some of them began deliberately to fire on the Hoffman Mission Station. He then adds: “Thus war began, as far as I know the facts.” As the Commissioner was at Cape Palmas at that time, he must have had a personal knowledge of the facts had they been such as he relates; and the impression produced on our mind is that, not himself believing the statement to be altogether true, he was too conscientious to vouch for it. Then as regards the Land question. The Special Commissioner states that the object of the combination among the natives is “the re-possession of the territory,” which involves rights and powers that would be incompatible with the fiscal arrangements of the Liberian Government; that the natives “deny that the Liberian Government has acquired the domain; that they declare themselves the masters; that they ignore the deed of purchase by the Maryland Colonization Society, and assert that the articles therein mentioned were paid to them for landing the immigrants and building their huts.” Looking to probabilities, we cannot believe that the natives sold the entire lands of their country, and their own right of free action, but only the lands on which they permitted the immigrants of the Colonization Society to settle, assisting them in landing, building their huts, &c. We must frankly state, however, that we do not attach much importance to this. Liberia has become an organized and recognized State, with institutions framed and established on the model of the United States of America. The presence of any European or other civilized Power on the coast lands of the Gedeboes and others would be fatal.\n[APRIL 1, 1876.]', 'last_edit_date': '1876-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1876#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE FUTURE OF LIBERIA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'How many Englishmen have visited Liberia? Five hundred, perhaps, at the most. It lies far away from the routes pursued by tourists, and the busy world hears little and knows less of the independent negro State which nestles in a corner of the West African Coast and has been the scene of a series of experiments absolutely unique in history. It was from this part of the African coast that some attempt was to be made to develop the Dark Continent. Emancipated slaves from the United States, now citizens of a republic established by themselves in the land of their forefathers, were to be the torchbearers of civilisation and to carry the lamp of learning to their brethren in the interior. Such was the scheme of the large-hearted and liberal philanthropists who, early in the present century, founded the various colonisation societies in the United States with a view of enabling its negro population to found settlements on the West Coast of Africa. These settlements were gradually formed, and, after passing through a series of trials, eventually confederated. In 1822 the republic was declared, and in 1847 Liberia was recognised as an independent State by the sovereigns of Europe and the United States Government. From Washington the new State borrowed its constitution. Although she has enjoyed the advantage of having had at least three Presidents—E. Johnson, Russworm, and Roberts—of high character and executive ability, it would be untrue to say that the hopes of the founders of Liberia have been realised. On the contrary the Liberian Government seems to have entirely failed to win the confidence or even to gain the respect of the native kings and tribes within its supposed ""sphere of influence""; indeed, some of them resist all attempts to enforce authority within the ill-defined boundaries of the State. At the recent inauguration of the new President—the Hon. — Cheeseman—it was a matter of general satisfaction that a gunboat, ordered from a Keil dockyard, was on her way out from Germany. This boat is to be the foundation of the new Liberian Navy, and, strange to say, it is required, not for the defence of the State, but to coerce a British merchant who for three years has declined to pay customs duty on the ground that he receives no protection from Government, that there is no civilised administration in the district in which he resides, and that he is compelled to employ and pay a police force of his own. The Government, urged by German merchants to suppress their independent competitor, has signified its intention of resorting to force, and will probably find itself in a difficulty with our Foreign Office if a single shot is fired on an English factory whose owner is considered to have made out a good case for non-payment of duty. The attempts of Christian missionaries to evangelise the Western districts of Africa have been discouraging. From the year 1481, when some priests from Rome unsuccessfully endeavoured to withstand the climate, the history of Christian labour is one continuous narrative of a futile struggle against disease and death. Protestant societies in the United States have literally poured dollars by thousands into Liberia. Some good work is being done by white ministers who have formed thriving settlements up the country (where the land is fertile and the climate healthy), and have urged upon the natives the importance of cultivating rice, corn, potatoes, ginger, sugar, coffee, and arrowroot, all of which are remunerative crops. As for cotton, indigo, pepper, pineapples, and gumtrees, they grow wild, and the superior knowledge of the missionaries has enabled the natives to gather them profitably. But Christian workers have to reckon with a foe more stubborn than Paganism. Islam is gradually winning its way towards the West Coast from the interior. The sword, it is true, goes hand in hand with the green banner, but the African negro is a ready convert. He finds the precepts of the Prophet easy to understand, and the sanction of polygamy is in entire accord with his present practice. Moreover, where Mahomet gains ground, intemperance—which unhappily follows Christian missions—disappears. I have said that Liberia is fertile. It is certainly the richest district in West Africa, but it is terribly neglected, and can never thrive under its present administration. There is practically no Government. The rule of the negro is marked by selfishness and corruption. The colonisation societies in the United States have almost abandoned in despair sending out more emigrants who, on landing, finding themselves free from control, quickly become lazy and wholly useless as pioneers for opening up fresh country. It must be confessed, therefore, that, after a trial of seventy years, the American negroes have failed to erect a State worthy of the name. They have lost what little credit they had twenty years ago—not even the interest is paid on the loan of 500,000 dols. raised in London in 1870—and Liberia is gradually drifting into the hands of a few wide-awake German merchants, who are understood to have made advances to Government against valuable securities, as well as to have exerted sufficient influence in Berlin to induce General Caprivi to protest in vigorous language against the concession known as the ""indiarubber monopoly,"" granted by President Johnson to an English syndicate of company promoters under circumstances which have been severely criticised.

Our palm oil and camwood were the chief productions exported to the United States, but since kerosene and cotton seed oil have come prominently to the front there, the exports of palm oil to that country have become almost nil compared with what it used to be. In those days it was not an uncommon thing for a single ship to take, among other products, palm oil to the value of 28,000 dols. to 36,000 dols. The vacancy caused by the decline of the trade of this article in the United States has not been filled. Your figures with reference to the export of coffee into the United States have been carefully scanned. We are entirely in accord as to the fact that our trade in this article might be increased to much larger proportions, and the quantity exported to the United States might be multiplied a hundred fold. Yet when the facts of the culture being in its infancy and of there being no banks nor other financial institutions to assist the growers, and no machinery, except in a few instances, are considered, I am of the opinion that our cultivators have made a tolerable good showing in foreign markets. The total product for 1887 was about 1,200,000 lbs., which are distributed as follows: to Germany, 606,000 lbs.; United States, 301,000 lbs.; Belgium, France, and England, 149,000 lbs.; Holland and 150,000 lbs.""\n\nBishop William Taylor, in his Quadrennial Report, states: ""The productive interests of Liberia are fairly prosperous. Within ten miles of Monrovia, up the St. Paul\'s river, there are ten steam sugar-cane crushing mills, and during the past year more than 600,000 lbs. of coffee have been exported from Monrovia.""\n\nThe fact should be noted that, by act of the national Parliament of Brazil in May, slavery was abolished throughout the Empire. For years a popular feeling in favour of emancipation has been growing; but now the government has suddenly moved in the matter and the glorious deed is done. This act is one in which philanthropists and Christians may well rejoice, and it will have an important bearing on the interests of the kingdom of Christ in Brazil and in Africa. So strong is the love of ""fatherland"" in the uncontaminated Brazilian Negroes that there is a steady current setting eastward from that Empire, the ""expatriates"" paying their own way to West Africa.—*African Repository.*', 'last_edit_date': '1889-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.731, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'This negro Republic was founded by the efforts of the American Colonisation Society, who in 1820 purchased a tract of land in the neighbourhood of Cape Montserrado for the purpose of affording an opportunity of settlement to liberated slaves. The liberated slave represented the best elements of the negro population of his day. At the same time, in America, there was no place for him. He could not enjoy the privileges of a white man, he had lost the legal protection of his master; he was in fact neither slave nor free. It was to meet his wants that the Liberian enterprise was organised. None but liberated slaves were, at first, permitted to take part in it. Many of them were well educated and possessed advantages which might have made life in America more attractive than the hardships and dangers of a colonising experiment. White men were in the first instance excluded from citizenship in the new colony, and for many years Liberia was simply what it professed to be—a community of negroes, who sought in Africa the enjoyment of a freedom that could be only nominal in America.\n\nNotwithstanding the care taken the first band of settlers had to fight for their existence and owed the victory which established them upon the coast to the aid of an English man-of-war. Thus England saved the life of the young colony, and in the sequel the bond then established between them has never been forgotten on either side. In 1824 the town which the settlers had raised received the name of Monrovia bestowed upon it in honour of the then President of the United States. At the same time the social condition of the colonists gave the name of Liberia to their settlement. The colony flourished, agriculture was developed; a policy of trade with the natives and road and bridge making was inaugurated with much success, and in 1828 a charter of government which contained the germ of a more elaborate constitution was issued by the Colonisation Society. From the beginning the principle of self-government was recognised in a liberal manner. The agent and vice-agent alone were nominated by the Society, all subordinate officers were elected by the Colony, but the vote was restricted to landowners. The ""Maryland Colonisation Society"" had established another community on the same coast, in which the sale of intoxicating liquors was entirely forbidden. To these in 1833 and 1835 was added a Quaker colony from Pennsylvania, under whose auspices a detachment of artisans came to form part of the population of the State. The new arrivals settled in Grand Bassa, and in 1839 Liberia was divided into two counties, Montserrado, containing the capital, and Grand Bassa.

While the African Times was printing last month there was being held what was grandiloquently styled the ""LIBERIAN ANNUAL BALL,"" seemingly, so far as we can make out, for the especial glorification of Mr. David Chinnery, in the character of his Excellency David Chinnery, Chargé d\'Affaires of the Republic of Liberia, and the Honourable Mrs. Chinnery! Mrs. Chinnery, of course, is not to blame for having the title of ""honourable"" improperly tacked to her name; and we merely notice it as an additional proof of the very questionable use made in this country at the present time of titles supposed to be derived from Liberia! We take it for granted, though we are not at all satisfied on this subject, that the appointment of Mr. Chinnery as Chargé d\'Affaires by the now deposed and imprisoned President Roye carried with it the designation of ""excellency,"" irrespective of whether Mr. Chinnery should be or should not be received and acknowledged as Chargé d\'Affaires by the British Government, to which it has been naturally supposed he was accredited; but which we believe we are correct in stating has never received or acknowledged him in that capacity. Even this, however, would not give the title of ""honourable"" to the wife of Mr. Chinnery. We repeat that we hope the new President of Liberia will exhibit the good sense of putting an end to what only seems to make Liberia ridiculous. A state with a gross revenue of about 10,000l. a-year, without (as Mr. Roye over and over again officially asserted in answer to just claims) a single cent* in its treasury, and unable to pay the salaries of its home officers, can only be made absurd by reiterated puffs of Liberian breakfasts, Liberian banquets, Liberian annual balls, &c. There may be new modes of making private fortunes, but there is no new mode of building up states. This can only be accomplished by the patient industry of their people and the development of natural, agricultural, and mineral resources. A loan, the annual interest on which is almost equal to the gross revenue, will not do it; but only serve to plunge the country deeper into debt and dishonour. Liberia ought not to have thought of raising money by loan until she possessed a surplus revenue at least equal to the charge that would fall upon her treasury for the annual interest thereon—a real, not a supposititious or purely imaginary surplus. Such an operation, if wisely conducted, is a mere capitalisation of the annual surplus; and, if raised without too great sacrifices, and honestly and economically applied in forwarding reproductive works, may often be very useful in creating additional public resources while increasing the well-being of the people. Liberia, without capitalists of her own, poor—we may almost say with truth, penniless—repels, instead of inviting, capital from other countries (except in the instance of the late most unjustifiable loan). She claims to possess a very large territory—600 miles of sea-board, unbounded as regards the interior, and is still greedily seeking to have her title acknowledged to other territories, such as the Gallinas, &c. Her immigrant population from the States is only about 15,000 to 17,000, yet no one can buy or own land, houses, &c., but an African—a Liberian. Thus she has made her bed, and an uncomfortable one it is; many of her population—we write of that immigrant population—starving in a land of immense natural resources, and very advantageously situate both as regards Europe and America. While the slave-trade was still in vigour, and before Liberia had been acknowledged as an African State by European Powers and by the United States, we can understand that there might be reasonable grounds for excluding Europeans or other strangers from possession of the soil. But, thanks to the indefatigable efforts of the now venerable as respected Mr. Gerard Ralston, so many years unpaid Consul-General, and who never aspired to be an ""excellency,"" Liberia has been acknowledged by every European Power; the slave-trade from Africa is for ever at an end; and even slavery itself is rapidly disappearing everywhere, except in the native heathen countries of Africa. There could no longer be any danger to Liberians in permitting Europeans to purchase as much land as they may choose. They would not buy more than they could utilise by their capital; they could only utilise what they might purchase by employing Liberians, by which in a short time many of these might be enriched, and many more be made comfortable, having their wants properly supplied by means of wages for their labour. Sugar, cotton, coffee, might be produced in large quantities for the European market, while it is notorious that enterprising men, owners of soil, having capital to work with, and with life and property duly protected, might soon double or treble the production of that great African staple, palm-oil. Europeans would never so throng the country as to be dangerous to the Liberians; and we see no other mode by which Liberia can progress than by welcoming them. With regard to the money lately raised by the loan in England, we now say distinctly and unhesitatingly—as we have before indicated—that in our opinion there is but one honourable course for Liberia to pursue. She cannot, with any regard for her own character, denounce and imprison the men who have raised the money for her and at the same time herself appropriate the plunder. She ought to restore to the bondholders all that remains of the money they have paid on their bonds, on condition of their giving up those bonds to be cancelled in exchange for that money, and for new bonds at par with 5 per cent. interest, for the balance which her poverty will not allow her at present to restore. Then, conducting herself modestly, without creating ""excellencies"" and ""lady honourables,"" without puffing English breakfasts, banquets, and so-called annual Liberian balls, she will soon become respected, and enlist the sympathies of the wise and the good of all countries. She has the choice of good and evil now before her.

There is a large aboriginal population ready for employment by those who may possess the means of payment for labour, not only in planting and securing crops, but in those indispensable accessories in new countries—the formation of roads, improving the navigation of rivers, and introducing that machinery which adds so much to the efficiency of manual labour.

Similarly, The African Times articles highlight internal disputes, such as the quarrel between political figures like ex-President Benson and Mr. Lynch, and the rebellion against President Roye. Ineffective governance is evident in the authorities' failure to address organized riots and maintain peace among rival tribes.

As indicated above, and for reasons already given above, the Liberian government was perennially nearbankrupt and owed huge debts to local and foreign creditors. By January 1908 Liberia's indebtedness to Britain comprised, according to the British Consul-General at Monrovia, £60000 a year 'for several years' while her indebtedness to German merchants in Liberia amounted to $120000 by September 1905. This indebtedness enabled the imperial powers to constantly interfere in the internal affairs of Liberia during the period under review in a way that they never did in Ethiopia where they were never provided with the cause nor the excuse so to do. Throughout the last three decades of the nineteenth century, the imperial powers sent mission upon mission to Liberia to offer aid to her to pay her debts if she would come under their protection. France did this in 1879, Germany in 1887 and Spain in 1886, and each power offered to regulate Liberia's finances, organize her defence, and establish and control her Frontier Force. At the same time, their resident ambassadors and representatives treated the Liberians with contempt and frequently imposed on her by denouncing her trade, customs and citizenship laws or bullying her to redress their nationals' grievances as Britain did in September 1869, August 1870, April 1871, February and June 1882, November 1886 and finally January 1909. 89 Germany similarly brought in her gunboats to intimidate Liberia in February and October 1881, in August 1897, January and September 1898 and December 1912. On each occasion, the German government demanded financial indemnity ranging between $3000 and $60000 from the Liberian government on mostly trivial grounds, particularly alleged 'insults' by Liberian officials to the German consul or German merchants in Liberia who invited the German intervention.\nThe three years 1907-9 witnessed an unprecedented escalation of this interference by Britain, France and Germany culminating in the famous 'Cadell Incident' of n and 12 February 1909. The issues involved included the obvious deplorable economic, social and political conditions in Liberia, the rivalry among European powers for influence and territory in Liberia at Liberia's expense and Liberians' indebtedness to these powers or their nationals."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.721, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': ""Economic and social developments and European intervention in Liberia's and Ethiopia's internal affairs, 1880-1914 > Liberia"", 'content': ""To avoid bankruptcy, the government borrowed frequently and heavily from Liberian and resident foreign merchants 'to carry out its most ordinary operations': $10000 in November 1896 at 9% interest from the German trading firm, A.

This was administered by British officers as from 1906, and by an 'International Receivership' as from 1912, to ensure and facilitate repayment to creditors. 71 Left with meagre funds after debt payments, and lacking skilled man› power, Liberia could not develop her human or natural resources to any extent or build an infrastructure. American missionary and philanthropic bodies bore the brunt of providing and funding most of Liberia's elementary and high schools, and Liberia's university established in Monrovia in 1862.

Competi› tion to control these jobs or the social surplus increased between political parties and interest groups like the 'founding fathers' (or AmericoLiberians who had settled in Liberia before Independence) and the 'sons of the soil' (or Americo-Liberians born in Liberia)."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia on the eve of the Scramble for Africa Liberia > Liberia', 'content': ""On the eve of the Scramble, the internal development of Liberia had not undergone much change since it had gained its independence from the American Colonization Society in 1847. The Legislature, modelled after the American Congress, consisted of a House of Representatives and a Senate. The Executive comprised the President and Vice-President elected biennially by the people, and cabinet members appointed by the President with the consent of the Senate. The Executive was represented in the county - the unit of local administration - by a county superintendent who headed the county's administration. In spite of the President's theoretically vast powers, owing to inadequate means of enforcing executive authority outside Monrovia, considerable political power was wielded by certain AmericoLiberian families at the county level, sometimes extending over several generations, during the Republican and True Whig regimes. Such families, described sarcastically by a Liberian critic as 'the lords and noblemen' of Liberia, included the Hoffs, Shermans and Watsons of Cape Mount; the Barclays, Colemans, Coopers, Dennises, Grimeses, Howards, Johnsons, Kings and Morrises of Montserrado; the Harmons and Horaces of Grand Bassa; the Birches, Greenes, Grigsbys, Rosses and Witherspoons of Sinoe; and the Brewers, Dossens, Gibsons, Tubmans and Yancys of Maryland. These families constituted the political (and invariably the economic) elite. 7\nSerious social cleavages, however, undermined Liberia's national unity. For example, the Republic's two political parties formed around independ› ence in 1847 (the Republican, dominated by the mulatto settlers; and the True Whig, dominated by the black settlers, the Congos and the educated indigenous Africans) lacked fundamental ideological or political differences and therefore tended to engage in sterile, acrimonious, biennial electioneer› ing for political ascendancy to control the Republic's vast patronage system. The Republicans ruled Liberia from Independence to 1870, when they were overthrown by the True Whigs, but they regained power in 1871 only to lose it again to the True Whigs in 1877.

Throughout the nineteenth century, Americo-Liberians' policy was to assimilate the indigenous Africans culturally and politically by 'civilizing' and Christianizing them, and giving them equal rights with the settlers. Although this was achieved to some extent with the Recaptives (who were much less numerous than the settlers), the Americo-Liberians, mindful of their own privileged position, main› tained tight political control over Liberia by restricting political participa› tion of even those indigenous Africans who were educated. Only very few of them were given the franchise on an equal footing with the AmericoLiberians (although these might themselves be illiterate and poor). The main indigenous African representation (mostly of the coastal Africans) in the Liberian Legislature as from 1875 consisted of African chiefs designated 'referees' (or 'delegates'), after their chiefdoms had paid an annual 'delegate fee' of $100 to the Liberian government. As the delegates 'spoke' through an interpreter solely on ethnic matters and could not vote, they had very little influence on government policy.$^{8}$ Hence both the educated Africans and the chiefs resented their restricted representation. Furthermore the Liberian government sought to maximize its import and export duties and other levies on trade and shipping which constituted its main sources of revenue. To facilitate collection and control of the external trade by Americo-Liberian merchants, from 1839 the government restricted foreign merchants to trade at only six Americo-Liberian portsof-entry. The restrictions and levies alienated both the foreign merchants who resented them, and the indigenous African chiefs who had formerly controlled the external trade and levied the dues. Often, the foreign merchants and chiefs combined to resist or defy the trade restrictions and levies, or to appeal to European states to intervene on their behalf. Thus, at various times during the nineteenth century, the Vai, Kru and Grebo of the Liberian coast put up an armed resistance to Liberian government impositions on their trade. 9"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': ""Economic and social developments and European intervention in Liberia's and Ethiopia's internal affairs, 1880-1914 > Liberia"", 'content': ""Side by side with European encroachments, Liberia faced serious internal economic and social problems. The Scramble and partition forced the Liberian government to advance into the Liberian hinterland to subjugate the indigenous ethnic groups and establish a colonial-type administration over them.$^{64}$ Each administrative unit or district was governed 'in› directly' through its principal chiefs in collaboration with a governmentappointed district commissioner. Up to 1914 most of the commissioners were Americo-Liberian or educated indigenous Liberian military officers. The administration was largely oppressive and corrupt. Most of the district commissioners, their aides, and troops, being poorly and irregularly paid, and seldom supervised from Monrovia, lived off their districts by extorting food, labour for their private farms, and excessive fines and taxes (above the official one dollar poll-tax on adult males, and labour required for public buildings and roads). 65 Not surprisingly, the indigenous Africans resisted not only their military subjugation to Liberian government authority - just as Africans elsewhere resisted subjugation to European rule - but also the excesses of the Liberian administration. Until subjugated by the Liberian militia, the Liberian Frontier Force and American naval ships, the Kru resisted intermittently, and particularly in 1915-16; the Grebo resisted in 1910; the Kissi in 1913; the Kpele and Bandi, 1911-14; the Gio and Mano, 1913-18; the Gbolobo Grebo, 1916-18; the Gola and Bandi, 1918-19; the Joquelle Kpele, 1916-20; and the Sikon in 1921. These protracted wars on different fronts and the cost and inefficiency of the 'native administration' encouraged foreign intervention and strained the government's human and material resources. 66 The government's revenues were never adequate. Foreign aid was meagre. Most Americo-Liberians preferred trade to agriculture and were seriously hurt by the worldwide depression of the late nineteenth century. By 1890 resident German, British and Dutch merchants dominated Liberia's external trade. Coffee, Liberia's major export commodity since the 1860s, was produced mostly by Americo-Liberian planters and entrepreneurs using both Recaptive and indigenous African labour.

Up to 1914, the officer commanding each detachment performed both military and administrative duties in his district. Consequently he received instructions from, and reported to both the Department of War and the Department of Interior (neither of which co-ordinated with the other).

The decline, since the late nineteenth century, of agriculture and trade which had provided many Liberians with means of livelihood, made the Liberian government the main employer of labour as well as the source of income and high social status for most Liberians.$^{24}$ Increasingly, therefore, it was important that prospective as well as incumbent holders of public or political office should support the government which was tantamount to supporting the ruling True Whig Party. Secondly, during the period 1915-35, perhaps even more than before, gross corruption and malpractices were resorted to in Liberia's public system and political processes. The keen competition between the True Whig and People's parties in the 1920s and early 1930s particularly exacerbated election malpractices, mostly by the ruling True Whig Party. At the elections of May 1927, for instance, President King allegedly polled 235000 votes, and his People's Party opponent, T. J. R. Faulkner, 9000 votes, whereas there were not more than 10 000 individuals entitled to vote throughout Liberia in that year. 25 Thirdly, as in the nineteenth century, the ruling and opposition parties were divided mainly by clashes of personalities or disagreements over the sharing of the social surplus and not by any marked ideological or policy differences. In 1911, for instance, the People's Party was organized by a splinter group of the True Whig Party as a consequence of Liberia's Vice-President Jerome J. Dossen of Maryland losing his bid for nomination as True Whig presidential candidate to Daniel B. Howard, the National Chairman of the party. Similarly in 1927, many True Whigs joined the People's Party not primarily because they favoured that party's pro› grammes, but because they opposed President King's bid for a 'third term'.$^{26}$ In the absence of major ideological or policy differences among Liberians, politics became largely a matter of collaboration or competition between the leading, mostly Americo-Liberian, families in the ruling or opposition parties to control the social surplus."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Foreign intervention in Liberia and Ethiopia, 1915-35 > Liberia', 'content': 'First, the Liberian government\'s penury and perennial indebtedness partly led to increased foreign control of Liberia\'s financial administration by the International Receivership, the Bank of British West Africa, and Firestone interests supported by the United States government.

Secondly, Liberia\'s unfavourable economic, social and administrative conditions became a major issue in the bitter political rivalry between the True Whig and People\'s parties and attracted considerable international attention.

Furthermore, the opposition parties contested for only a limited number of the seats in the Legislature. At the elections of 1897, 1903 and 1905, it fielded no candidates for the presidency or vice-presidency, only for the House and Senate. At the elections of 1907 and 1919, the True Whig Party was the only party in the field. Whereas most of the True Whig candidates won with large majorities, only a few of the opposition candidates won. 23 Thus, excepting the 1920s and early 1930s when the People's Party seriously challenged the True Whig Party, Liberia had gradually evolved during the twentieth century into a virtual one-party state - one of the earliest African countries to do so."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Economic and social change in Liberia and Ethiopia, 1915-35 > Liberia', 'content': ""less bleak economic circumstances throughout our period (1915-35), the Liberian government was left with perennially meagre funds after continuous debt payments and could not effect economic or social development of Liberia to any extent.

In the end it filed its Report on 8 September 1930. The Report showed that while no form of organized slave trading existed, labour was wastefully and forcibly recruited for public works, private use and for export with the collaboration of the Liberian Frontier Force and high government officials.$^{83}$ The Report also examined Americo-Liberian/indigenous Liberian relations and the general administration of the Liberian govern› ment, both of which it found unsatisfactory.$^{84}$ Hence it recommended to the League that Liberia should be placed under a 'capable and warmhearted white administration'. 85 In view of the largely deplorable internal conditions in Liberia, most of the Commission's findings and recommendations were fair and reason› able in many respects.

On its own part the United States govern› ment expressed 'profound shock' at the 'shocking suppression of the natives' revealed in the Report.

In January 1932 the Brunot Commission also presented its Report to the League. Its recommendations were similar in many respects to those of the Christy Commission but less unfavourable to Liberia on the whole. Traditional African communal labour was to replace forced labour for public works; the indigenous Liberians were to be granted an undisputed ownership of their lands, the authority and dignity of the African chiefs were to be upheld by the Liberian government, and the education of the indigenous Liberians and the means of communication with the Liberian hinterland were to be improved. The hinterland was to be divided into three provinces to be administered by foreign provincial and deputy commissioners under whom would be Liberian county super› intendents and district commissioners. The commission also suggested that for Liberia's finances to improve reasonably, Firestone would have to modify the terms of the loan agreement of 192o. 93 This intervention in Liberian affairs by the League significantly in› creased the opposition to the Liberian Government of many indigenous Liberians, particularly the Kru, Grebo and Vai. Many of them believed that the 'white men' would soon take over the Liberian government from the Americo-Liberians; hence they ceased to pay taxes or perform forced labour on public projects like road building. Simultaneously, some of them revived intra-ethnic conflicts over disputed boundaries, farmlands and chieftainships.\nTo maintain peace and order, President Barclay sent a detachment of the Liberian Frontier Force to the Kru and Grebo districts in May 1931 with specific instructions to its Americo-Liberian commander, Colonel T. Elwood Davis, that the detachment was 'a patrol in force and not a punitive expedition'.$^{94}$ However, in the course of the patrol, fighting broke out between the detachment and the Kru of Sasstown led by their paramount chief, Juah Nimley, which provided fresh grounds for external intervention in Liberian affairs.

Since the late nineteenth century their number had reportedly declined owing to a higher death than birth rate, and the virtual cessation of immigration of blacks from America. The situation led to increased intermarriage and liaison, mostly between Americo-Liberian men and indigenous African women (many of whom were educated in the Liberian schools), and a corresponding increase of Liberians with mixed Americo-Liberian/indigenous African parentage.

But the British Commissioners are stated to have been inflexible on the point that the south bank of the Big River should mark the utmost northern extension of the young and ambitious Republic. The British Commissioners have, therefore, gone their way, and the Liberian authorities continue their claim to the Shebar as the boundary.\n\nThere are many important considerations involved in this question. We have not time or space to enter upon them on this occasion. We shall merely say that, despite all assertions to the contrary, when we regard the state of the public revenue, and the disposable forces in Liberia, we are constrained to believe that it would be at present impossible for the Republic, without a most injurious, if not fatal exhaustion, to force the Gallinas to acknowledge her sway, even should the British Government admit her claims to extension as far as the Shebar. We must say that we consider the Gallinas would be a fatal gift to her—or, if not fatal, a most disastrous one for many generations. She has a sufficient stretch of coast without this northern extension; and toward the interior her boundaries are necessarily of the most elastic kind, and the territories ready for her appropriation, whenever she may be able to occupy them, are such as would afford suitable ""locations"" for millions of American immigrants. The climate of the interior, too, is far more healthy than that of the Liberian coast districts; which, among the unhealthy, are proverbially so. The revenue of the Republic scarcely suffices, at present, for the salaries of the Government functionaries; and as it increases, any surplus will be far better appropriated to the extension of good roads and improvement of rivers into the interior than to war on the northern frontier.\n\nAn American engineer, a Mr. Morris, introduced a coffee huller into Liberia, for cracking the very hard exterior shell of the Liberian coffee. When he showed its capabilities it was much praised, and that was something akin to public enthusiasm about it. But before importing any for sale, he demanded a patent protection. This he has great difficulty in obtaining. The Liberians are so innocent and naïve, that ""they cannot conceive what on earth he wants with a patent; why cannot he bring in some machines at once and sell them?"" The Liberians have a keen eye for the ""Almighty Dollar."" The Republic ought to become rapidly wealthy, possessing, as it does, such vast natural resources.\n\nThe Liberian journals are, we regret to see, almost exclusively occupied with the acrimonious quarrel between Mr. (now ex-) President Benson and Mr. Lynch, to which we have before alluded.

Until we received these afflicting details we were not aware that there was such an entire State paralysis in Liberia. Our columns will be too full this month to allow of our inserting the accounts of the disgraceful organised riots at Cape Palmas, which, but for the courage of Judge Gibson, would have been stained with the murder of an unoffending citizen, simply because he had been appointed to the office of Collector of Customs and Postmaster by the President of the Republic, whom, it seems, the Cape Palmas citizens are determined to insult and disobey, because they were opposed to his election and were beaten by the votes in other districts of the country. But we purpose inserting those accounts next month, as they throw considerable light upon the actual condition of the Republic. In this present number we must confine ourselves to a brief notice of those atrocities, which, as we have already said, involve the whole so-called civilised community, President, Government, and citizens, in deep disgrace. We insert two letters giving an account of these atrocities; of the kidnapping of some thirty women belonging to the native Cape Palmas Town, by the natives of the Cavalla River towns and others (kidnappers and victims all reputed subjects of Liberia); of the horrible confinement of these poor women, the unspeakable atrocities committed upon them, and the almost certainty that they will either be murdered or sold into the interior as slaves; of this kidnapping having taken place early in January last; of the Liberian authorities having been immediately informed of it, of their promise to do their duty in this disgraceful business; and of their having allowed up to the time at which the Roquelle called at Cape Palmas three whole months to pass without having taken one single step for effecting the release of those thirty innocent victims, and wiping off the deep disgrace which such atrocities inflict on Liberia as a whole by an adequate punishment of the offenders. That the Government, under such a man as the actual President, should have allowed this disgrace to continue, shows Liberia to be in a worse condition than we had imagined. It seems quite clear that the Government possesses neither moral nor physical power, otherwise it must have effectually interfered; while as regards the mass of so-called civilised citizens, what are we to say? Had they possessed one particle of that feeling which raises a people in the estimation of the world, they would have risen en masse and marched under the orders of the President to the Cavalla towns and river, and freed once and for ever their country and that noble stream from such atrocities. For the mob of Cape Palmas citizen rowdies, who, to the number of some three hundred, threw themselves like bloodthirsty fiends upon a person appointed to office among them by the President of the Republic, we feel the most thorough disgust and loathing. Situate as they are so few miles from the place in which the Cavalla wretches hold those poor unoffending women in such horrible captivity, they would, if they had in them a single spark of real manhood, have long ere this rescued the captives and taken vengeance on their captors, or died every one of them in the attempt. We have been long labouring to show that the Liberians merit the sympathy and respect of the civilised world. We fear now that we were altogether mistaken. Why, our heart bleeds at the cry of anguish in some of the numerous letters we have received from friends of the poor wretched victims, as they pray us, for the love of God, to obtain aid from the British Government for them, and yet that vile rebellious mob of self-styled civilised citizens at Cape Palmas look on unmoved. When we have published the other letters in our possession, our friends will see more clearly than they have ever yet done what the condition of Liberia really is. We are sorry indeed to have to make such revelations respecting a people who we had thought were really zealously exerting a civilising influence over a large extent of country.

It is well they did so, because the British Government would not have hesitated to lend the services of a ship of war to the Government of Liberia for obtaining the release of the captives. Should the peace written of as likely to be restored between the people of those towns be also established as a further fruit of our labours, such a result will give us an added pleasure. We know that when the present estimable President of the Republic became convinced that the report given by us of the atrocious treatment of those poor women was substantially correct, he became very anxious to obtain their liberation, in which, however, he had great difficulties to contend with, in consequence of the unjustifiable and disgraceful opposition of the Cape Palmas Americans to his Government. We hope, however, soon to see the Liberia authorities in a position to do rapid justice in matters of this kind within the borders of the Republic. But it is difficult to believe that this can be the case if the citizens of the Republic conduct themselves in the disgraceful manner.\n31\n\nexposed in another letter which we publish, relative to the wreck of a British vessel, and the plunder of her cargo and of the captain's effects, both at the waterside by appointed guardians of the property, and in the hotel to which the captain conveyed what he had himself saved from the wreck. Such excesses and cruel dishonesty are greatly to be deplored, and will not serve to raise the reputation of the citizens of the Republic in the estimation of other countries, as we would earnestly desire to see it raised. President Roye, on his return, will have plenty of work on his hands to carry into effect even a tithe of the admirable reforms enunciated in his presidential message.

Now this North and this South had some grand principles upon which they went to war. What principles have we? The retaining of a few men in office for their personal gratification or individual profit; or to put them out in order to put in others to do as they are doing? When this North and this South, and Paris, have done killing up a few hundreds of thousands, and are through destroying a few millions-worth of property, they have yet a country left, and they have the world without—the white-world if you please—to draw on, and to soon build up again, in men and in means, and in the world\'s sympathy.

There are to be no more so-called Chargés d\'Affaires; in fact, President Roberts affirms that there never was one, the appointment of Mr. David Chinnery by the late President Roye never having received confirmation by the Senate, without which it was no nomination at all.

We understand that the Consul-generalship has been offered to Mr. Jackson, the present Consul, who procured an injunction from the Court of Chancery some time ago restraining the London bankers in possession of a portion of the loan money from parting with the same upon the order of Mr. Chinnery. Mr. Jackson certainly thus rendered a service which deserved recognition; and we are glad to hear that he is likely to accept the offer of President Roberts.

We are kept down in this place next to servitude; our will is not our own; a few men who are in command of a little property keep us knuckle down to them. If we are in their employment we are seldom paid in money, but are obliged to take up such estables as they choose to give us. If a captain or supercargo comes, and wishes to give some of the enterprising young men of this place a little trust, these merchants here, though doing business on trust themselves, will oppose it, and advise the parties not to give them trust. If any of us try to do a little trading whereby we may progress, we are opposed, oppressed, and all kind of stratagems will be used to prevent our success. Hence we are living here not in harmony and love; every man is opposed to the progress of his neighbour in whatever pursuit he follows; whether it be in the mercantile line or farming, it seems as a dagger driven into us to see any one else prosper; very few sympathise with their fellow-citizen when misfortune happens to him, and fewer still will give any aid except for a large reward. Even the immigrants who are invited by us from America to come and help us to build up this black nationality, when they come out, except they possess a little money, are looked down upon with disdain and contempt by the other citizens; any advantages that can be taken of them will be taken. Sometimes we may be paid by the merchants when we are in their employment in Liberian currency, and if without leaving the store we give them back the currency for the purchase of some article in their store, they refuse to take the very currency they paid us, demanding specie of us; and if they do take it, it will be at a discount; and when foreigners come here to reside among us to do business, whether they be our colour or white men, whereby we can get articles cheaper, be employed, and the country built up for our benefit, the majority of people are against them, and they will try everything in their power to entrap them in law-suits; they will go to their places of business, abuse, insult, curse and swear at them, and some of our young men, when in the employment of foreigners, will skulk away a part of their time in idleness; and if their employers bring them up for it they will question their authority in doing so, and begin to speak of their freedom, and demand full pay for the time they have wasted in idleness; and if the foreigners refuse to pay them they are taken to law and made to pay, for our laws, Mr. Editor, are all one-sided. No foreigners or new-comers expect to get justice in Liberia; if they do, they will certainly drain the pockets well first. Whether this is done from the ignorance of the people, or whether they are influenced by the few merchants here, I cannot say; one thing I know, that this is a practice in the Republic, to take all advantage they can of foreigners, that they may be discouraged and leave the country. I am a supporter of foreigners, for without foreigners we cannot live. America receives into her country immigrants of all nations. The Dutchman finds a home and welcome; he brings with him skill and science, and puts them in operation. The Frenchman, the Englishman, the German, and Italian find welcome hands beckoning them to come; therefore America has advanced to what she is this day. Why can\'t Liberia stretch out her hands to all nations, and invite them into her country? Why can\'t Liberia open her ""Constitution,"" and allow all nations to come in and build her up? Why do Liberians take advantage of foreigners and strangers, and combine together against them? These are the things that keep us from progressing. Since our Government was a Government it has been in an embarrassed state; never was Liberia able to redeem her currency in gold and silver, as she reports.

Had he done this he certainly would have never advised in one breath the increase of Liberia\'s custom dues, and in the next breath a laying on of heavy taxes. The idea is too preposterous. Does he mean to borrow money for the express purpose of grinding the poor people to death with taxes? Taxes indirect in the shape of duties; taxes direct as his No. IV. argues. Certainly our financiering friend, though a scholar, has forgotten the old Latin proverb, *Ne sutor ultra crepidam*—don\'t let a shoemaker go beyond his last. What supposes he a direct tax, on the head, if he pleases, of each taxable man in Liberia, say of ten dollars per head, would pay? Now suppose, Mr. Financier, on a direct tax scale you charge every man ten dollars; with a voting population of 2,000, you will get twenty thousand dollars. Now what is twenty thousand dollars to a State whose legislative expenses alone scarcely ever go below twenty thousand? With judiciary, civil list, and other expenses doubling this amount, our doctrine is not, as our reviewer tries to show it to be, that Liberia does not need money. Liberia needs money as a State, and most of all she needs the operation of monetary schemes, plans, and uses within the country—such as extensive farming operations, large manufactories, banks, &c., through which the willing labour and energies of the people could find employment and adequate remuneration on the live-and-let-live principle.

On my visit to the Leeward Counties not long ago, I observed, while at one of the stores, a legislator come in. Poor man, he looked weak from starvation. ""Please trust me,"" he said to the merchant, ""a croo of rice, a pint of palm-oil, and two salt fish."" ""No,"" said the merchant, walking away at the same time. ""I will do no such a thing."" ""My wife and children,"" continued the legislator, ""have not eaten anything for two days, and we have not had a light in our house for a fortnight."" ""I don\'t care anything about that,"" said the merchant; ""you fellows when you go to Legislature don\'t do what we merchants wish you to do; we will show you all that you shall either serve us or die of starvation. Go to your Government,"" continued the merchant, ""and let the Government give you rice, palm-oil, salt fish, and tobacco."" This poor man told me this; he had about $200 Government money in his house in Treasury orders; and these he said he had had for nearly two years, and cannot get anything for them. They are slips of paper, written by the Superintendent to the Treasury to pay bearer; and that Government money is as useless as the dry leaves which we blow from the trees, except on some occasion when the merchants want to buy any Government lands. Then they notify to the citizens that they will sell for Treasury orders, and what will they sell? Such things as rotten cod-fish; sometimes shoulders of bacon with the weavels; and old damaged cloths. Now for these, Mr. Editor, he will charge, 6 dols. for a croo of rice; 10 dols. for a shoulder or side of rotten bacon; 2 dols. for a yard of striped cloth damaged, and 50 cents for a quart of the brine of salt fish or beef, because they are Treasury orders. Now the citizens worked hard for Treasury orders, as any other man does for silver and gold. When the merchant has got enough of these Treasury orders to buy his land, he stops selling his damaged goods. Our citizens rejoice and think it is a Godsend when a merchant gives notice that he will sell some of his rotten stuffs for Treasury orders; for the citizens have no other way of getting rid of those Treasury orders but by these chances, and these chances do not very often happen. Under such circumstances, Mr. Editor, how can a country rise? Our Senators and Representatives must be independant men, and the Government must make them so; for our blowing to the world that we are independant, when we are in reality not so, is all bosh. We talk too much; we boast too foolishly on nothing; we must try and propose something of a substantial nature for our Government. Here we sit with folded hands, surrounded with bush even to our very doors, in which there are leopards, tigers, deer, snakes, monkeys, drivers, and all kinds of ferocious animals and reptiles; our streets just a little footpath, so that when our ladies come out after it has been raining, or in the morning after the dew has been falling, they scarcely walk a few yards before their boots and dresses are wet from the grass. We ought to be ashamed of ourselves, for the privileges we have had and opportunities given to us; for we have done nothing for ourselves; nothing for our country; nothing for our heathen brethren, but to make them hewers of wood and drawers of water; nothing to encourage commerce; nothing towards the development of the resources of the country, and nothing for our children. When we can manage to clear a little spot of land to build a house, 12 feet long by 10 feet wide, besides renting a portion of our shed to two families besides ourselves, and planted a little patch with potatoes or cassada; we think we have achieved a great thing; and then we walk about with folded hands, boasting of our liberty, and what an immense country we have; and that\'s all about it, while the bush is staring us in the face as we look out of our windows. We hope these facts, thrown out in your paper, will make a move in our Government, and our citizens also, and change our policy in oppressing the country and keeping it down.

The Government desires that everything shall remain in statu quo until the assembling of the National Legislature next month. To prevent the money from being misapplied as paid up, I have instructed our agents abroad to give notice to the bank or banks in which the proceeds of said loan may have been deposited to stop the payment of all drafts or bills drawn on account of said loan, whether drawn by the President and members of the former Government of Liberia, or by any parties abroad. I have deemed it prudent to give you notice of this fact, as you are the representative of some who are interested in this matter.\n\n(Signed) H. R. W. JOHNSON.\n\nJ. Gertenberg, Esq., Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Council of Foreign Bondholders.\n\nCouncil of Foreign Bondholders, 115, Palmerston-buildings, London, December 6.\n\nGentlemen,—On the 30th of August I addressed you, calling your attention to several points in the prospectus of the Liberian Loan which were stated to be open to doubt. Not receiving an answer, I called at your office and was informed your solicitor was out of town. The Council has received no answer to this letter. Last week Mr. Gertenberg, the chairman of the Council, received a letter from the Department of State at Monrovia, dated the 8th November, stating the objections of the newly-installed Government to the loan, and I called upon your firm with the letter. I saw two members. One of them at first thought it was untrue that any revolution had taken place in Liberia. The other said the subscribers had paid their money and got the bonds, and that was enough. To this doctrine I demurred. As the arrival of another mail places beyond doubt the fact of the change of government in Liberia, I now take the opportunity of sending you a copy of the letter of Mr. H. R. W. Johnson, from the Department of State, and invite your consideration of this and of my former letter, and of the communication from you of any explanation of the course pursued by you in this matter, and of what they propose for the protection of the bondholders.—I am, Gentlemen, your most obedient servant,\n\nHYDE CLARKE, Secretary.\n\nMessrs.

The business they did was chiefly in giving divorcements, and trying to impeach the Vice-President and Secretary of State, in which they failed. The Legislature, some years ago, made a law to this effect: that all persons requiring a divorce should go through the quarterly court, but, without repealing this law, they have leaped over it and given divorce. In one Legislature fifty women have been divorced from their husbands. There are one or two remarkable cases among them. One of these women had been despatched to America by her husband, and as soon as she was gone her husband petitioned the Legislature for a divorce and obtained it, the woman not being here to defend herself. Another case was that of a man whose wife was said to have committed adultery about twelve years ago, and thereby had a child. The husband lived with her during this long period as man and wife, and when he finds he is in a little better circumstances than he had been, he petitions the Legislature for a divorce for the adultery she committed twelve years ago, and the Legislature grants it. It is said that some of the legislators were bribed. Bribery is common here, but, whether they have been bribed or not, they have thrown on the country fifty women to become prostitutes. We have got enough prostitutes already in the country; silver money and calico prints, &c., &c., are great temptations to our women, and there are only a few women who will not throw themselves in the way of men for these articles, both married and single women. There are cases here where men and women have been caught committing adultery in churches, and nothing has been done to them than making a few days' talk of it. And also there are cases where persons have married one week and divorced the next, and also of persons who divorced their wives, and in a few weeks or months turned around, courted the same wife, and married her. Again, women lying about in the streets, in the bushes, and alongside of churches at night, cohabiting while services are conducting in the churches, is a common thing. But what are the poor women to do—no work for them to do—the Government has no money to issue to the people. Starvation is severely felt in the country. People are in rags and tatters. The Government lays heavy burdens on the people which cannot be borne; they raised the duties exceedingly high to prevent foreigners from coming to our shores. I have seen people daily staggering about the streets from pure hunger. The Government, the Government—yea, the Legislature—have brought all these evils and distresses on us. They have made laws to debar the progress of the people and the country; and you should see some of them, Mr. Editor, boasting of the great work they have done by giving divorces to fifty persons without seriously considering that they have thrown fifty women into this small place to become prostitutes, for they must certainly become prostitutes before they can live. If any person wants the Legislature to do anything for them here he makes a little dinner, having something extra that the legislators are not accustomed to have in their homes; lays before them his wishes at the table, and there and then they will decide on giving it to him. Some of the few merchants and the so-called well-to-do folks tell the people not to vote for the opening of the Constitution, for if they do the white men will become citizens, and take away our country, picturing to them the cruelty they received from the white men their masters in America, and that the white men will again make slaves of them if the Constitution be opened; and the bulk of people in Liberia are so ignorant that they are blinded to their own interest and welfare. This is the present state of Liberia, and it is getting from worse to worse every day."", 'last_edit_date': '1871-04-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1871#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Finances of Liberia re the Liberia Loan', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'If any additional evidence had been wanting of the iniquity of the Liberian Loan, negotiated in this country a few years since, the Financial Report of the Secretary of the Treasury, issued in December last for the year then ended, would be very conclusive. It is therein stated that the receipts from all sources during the twelve months have been 119,451 dollars. Of this, however, it appears that the sum of 45,000 dollars was derived from the new paper issues authorized last year; so that the real revenue obtained by taxation of every kind, chiefly Customs\' duties, was 74,451 dollars, or under 20,000l. sterling! Can it be denied that the plunderers who feasted upon that Loan deserve at the same time the execration both of the unfortunate bondholders in this country and of the honest men in the Republic? It looks like a species of irony, and of a very bitter kind, when the President, in his Message to Congress, recommends, as he is reported to have done, ""that measures should be taken at once (!) for the extinction of the claims held by foreigners against the Republic."" Alas, poor bondholders! What could the Liberian legislators, even with the very best intentions in the world, perform in the way of payment under actual circumstances? Not only was the revenue really received from all legitimate sources only 20,000l., but the expenditure amounted to 116,000 dollars, or nearly 30,000l. It is pretty clear, we think, that there must be either a large increase of trade or of taxation, or a great reduction of expenditure, if the finances are to be brought into the state that we and all well-wishers of the Republic most earnestly desire. If the revenue will not allow of the actual scale of salaries, foremost among which are those of the representatives and senators while in session, they ought to be at once reduced. The legislators, we have been informed, always manage to secure their allowance, which is on far too liberal a scale, whether there be available funds for other obligations or not. We do not mean to affirm that the payments to legislators are too high in amount, provided the legitimate revenues of the Republic were on a scale of corresponding magnitude; but they are far too high while the public treasury is smitten with such extreme poverty. We hope, too, that we shall not hear of Ministers Plenipotentiary to Europe while the entire public revenue amounts to only 20,000l. a year. It was by a Minister Plenipotentiary, if our memory serves us right, with a Consul-General and diplomatic staff, that the bondholders were led to believe in magnificent public resources of the Republic. Liberia will, we hope and believe, become in process of time a great and wealthy nation, but she is not such at present, nor can she be in the near future; and the old fanfaronade kept up by Ministers ordinary, extraordinary, and plenipotentiary, Secretaries of Legation, Consuls-General, dinners, banquets, balls, and verbose speechifying, though they answered for a time the nefarious purposes of the money-seekers, only served to bring undeserved ridicule on a striving, rising nationality which had set for itself the very difficult task of development in isolation; a fundamental error, but an error not at all unnatural when we consider that the United States\' immigrants of which it is composed had so many reasons for not giving to white men any opening to assume power among them.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1881#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LIBERIA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We are sorry to learn that the Cavalla River is in a very disturbed state, and that the Liberian Government find it impossible to keep peace among the rival tribes, who are constantly at war with one another.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1864#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'A Threatening New Loan to Liberia', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Loan contracted in London in the name of Liberia a few years since—a Loan which has brought so much unmerited disgrace upon that country and its people, who, we believe, did not receive a third of the amount for which they were made responsible—has rendered us keenly alive to all rumours of projected financial operations in which the name of the Republic is in any way mentioned. We believe immense harm to have been done by the Loan in question, not only to the unfortunate innocent bondholders, who advanced money for which they are not receiving any return, but also to the Republic in whose name the Loan was contracted. We have adverted more than once to the unhealthy notoriety given to Liberia by constantly recorded banquets and hole and corner meetings in London, of which inflated accounts are made to find their way into the daily journals; and whenever we observe any increasing activity in this calculated display of interest in the welfare of Liberia, and this self-laudation of its professed friends, we become suspicious of some new evil about to be hatched by the diligent incubators. There has been that ""increased activity"" of late; and we were not, therefore, surprised to hear that efforts were being made to increase the indebtedness which every true friend of Liberia has deeply deplored. Rumours have reached us that some parties, whose names have not been mentioned to us, are far advanced in negotiations in Paris for a new Loan, to be subscribed in France, of the nominal amount of 2,000,000fr., or £80,000 sterling. We do not know what statements may have been made of the wealth and resources of Liberia to those who are expected to advance this sum of money; but without knowing this, we denounce the whole affair, by whomsoever it may have been undertaken and promoted, as a gross swindling transaction, which, if carried to completion, will be fraught with very deep mischief to the Republic. Liberia has no developed means, no actual resources or revenue, to enable her to pay the interest, or any portion of the interest, of the former Loan already mentioned as having been contracted in London a few years ago; and there cannot, therefore, be any just grounds for believing that she could pay the interests that may become due upon a new Loan. This being the case, we look to the ultimate possible issue as regards the Republic, which, if the precedent of the former Loan is to rule, cannot hope to obtain more than a mere fraction of the money that may be borrowed in its name. We would warn the public in Liberia, the senators and representatives, that there is danger for them and for their country in any such operation as that of which a rumour has reached us. There is an old proverb about ""playing with edged tools."" The French Government does not look upon frauds practised on its subjects with the indifference manifested by the British Government when its people are similarly fleeced. We suppose the Loan contracted for—the bonds issued—the money paid to the contractors, whoever they may be. This cannot have been done without the signature of the President of Liberia, or of some one duly authorized to act in his name. The stipulated interest would perhaps be paid for the first year or two out of the money of the Loan itself, as was done in the matter of the London Loan. The Liberian Government would then necessarily make default. French creditors are a very clamorous body of men. They would most probably appeal to their Government for justice, as there would almost certainly have been mis-statements on which they could base the charge of fraudulent deception. The French Government would, it is not at all unlikely, demand the payment of the amounts due to their subjects, and adopt measures to enforce their claim. The French Government, as the people of Sierra Leone know to their cost, not at all indisposed to territorial acquisitions in North-west and West Africa; and Monrovia and Cape Palmas might be taken possession of as securities for the repayment of the principal and interest of the Paris Loan. If once thus taken possession of, the Republic of Liberia will have come to an end, and Liberia would become a dependency of the French Republic, or Empire, as the case may be. Such an end to the first civilized negro nation on the West Coast of Africa would be indeed a deplorable event; and the citizens of Liberia should exert themselves in representations to their Government authorities, to render impossible a transaction that could by any possibility involve such a contingency. There is a great future for the Republic in quiet, steady labour. Its coffee industry may and ought to become a source of private prosperity, and a good feeder of the public revenue, which has so much need of augmentation. Our friends in Liberia must never lose sight of the fact that the capacity of the negro race for civilized self-government is now on trial in their hands, and that it devolves on them not to allow the issue to be jeopardized by the machinations of individuals intent only on forwarding their own particular interests, and gratifying their own personal desires and ambitions. In thinking over the whole matter, it has been suggested to us that the contemplated French Loan (if the rumour we have heard be indeed true) may not be unconnected with the next Presidential election in Liberia, and may be intended, among other purposes, to advance the prospects of some one who covets the Presidential Chair. We do not see how a connection with a measure which must under any circumstances be disastrous for Liberia, could advance the prospects of a would-be President, unless it were that a portion of the proceeds of the Loan could be converted into material for ""greasing the wheels"" of a Presidential canvass. Be this as it may, and whatever the object, whether public or private, in view in the negotiation of such a Loan as we have alluded to, or any other Loan for Liberia at the present time, we would again earnestly entreat the prominent citizens of the Republic in Liberia to be up and doing, that they may prevent both present and prospective evil to themselves and to their country.', 'last_edit_date': '1878-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1878#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We are glad to have received once again a copy of the Liberian Herald.

The resuscitated journal has made some expressions of ours the subject of its leader. We ventured to observe, some time since, when treating of the obstacles to rapid progress in Liberia, that it might be ""worth while for the Liberians resolutely to set themselves about the inquiry as to how far their laws and regulations with regard to foreigners and to the tenure of land may be chargeable with the great evil of impeding the introduction of that which is the sinew of agriculture as well as of war—i.e., capital.""\n\nWe cannot but express our deep regret, presuming the Liberian Herald to be the true exponent of Liberian feeling, at the state of feeling in Liberia on this question.

Because we urge the citizens of the republic to increased production of those staples which find so ready a sale in European markets!\n\nOur observations were justified, we considered, by the obstacle which meets at the first step every one who is desirous of obtaining for Liberian agriculture the assistance of foreign capital; as also for the Liberian Government, which so greatly needs it for roads and other works of public utility, on which the development of the resources of all countries so much depends. No foreigner can possess land or houses in Liberia. Consequently, no foreigner can hold land or houses in Liberia as a security for capital advanced.

We have read it attentively, but we cannot find in it that dependable rectification of errors in King Weah’s statement, published by us last month, which we had looked for. Having received constant and minute intelligence from Cape Palmas, from the period of the advent of the Liberian Commissioner there, we discover that there are important omissions in the Report; nor are we at all satisfied that King Weah’s statements are incorrect as regards either of the two great points—viz., the commencement of warlike operations and the territorial claims. We are surprised at the failure of the Report on these points, because, if there be one thing more than another in which the public men in Liberia have excelled, it has been in the drawing up of their Reports, Presidential Messages, and other State documents; and still more surprised, because many portions of the Report are written with a most charming air of sincerity and good feeling, becoming the character and position of the Commissioner. The Commissioner states that there was a warlike demonstration of the natives on the 10th of August, and that on the following day some of them began deliberately to fire on the Hoffman Mission Station. He then adds: “Thus war began, as far as I know the facts.” As the Commissioner was at Cape Palmas at that time, he must have had a personal knowledge of the facts had they been such as he relates; and the impression produced on our mind is that, not himself believing the statement to be altogether true, he was too conscientious to vouch for it. Then as regards the Land question. The Special Commissioner states that the object of the combination among the natives is “the re-possession of the territory,” which involves rights and powers that would be incompatible with the fiscal arrangements of the Liberian Government; that the natives “deny that the Liberian Government has acquired the domain; that they declare themselves the masters; that they ignore the deed of purchase by the Maryland Colonization Society, and assert that the articles therein mentioned were paid to them for landing the immigrants and building their huts.” Looking to probabilities, we cannot believe that the natives sold the entire lands of their country, and their own right of free action, but only the lands on which they permitted the immigrants of the Colonization Society to settle, assisting them in landing, building their huts, &c. We must frankly state, however, that we do not attach much importance to this. Liberia has become an organized and recognized State, with institutions framed and established on the model of the United States of America.

It emphasizes the government's inability to effectively occupy and administer its territory due to military weakness, inadequate resources, corruption, inadequate revenue, and social cleavages, which further weakened its control. The lack of international recognition allowed European powers to interfere in its internal affairs, resulting in territorial losses and strained relations with indigenous groups.

The articles describe Liberia's nominal control over its territory, with native tribes often resisting its authority, evidenced by conflicts with the Cavalla and Rocktown people and the Settra Kroo natives. The government's inability to enforce laws and protect its citizens, as illustrated by the plea for British intervention to free women held by the Cavalla people, further demonstrates its limited governance capacity. Additionally, the articles discuss Liberia's financial struggles, such as low salaries for government officials and prohibitive taxation discouraging foreign trade and investment. The lack of international recognition is evident in the refusal of foreign ships to pay duties and the challenges Liberia faced in asserting its rights against foreign powers.

Secondly, Liberia\'s unfavourable economic, social and administrative conditions became a major issue in the bitter political rivalry between the True Whig and People\'s parties and attracted considerable international attention.

Simultaneously, it reported favourably on Faulkner as a \'progressiveminded citizen\'.$^{79}$ Earlier, too, in 1929, the British press had carried several editorials highly critical of the Liberian government.

Although they appreciated western education brought by the Americo-Liberians and white missionaries, some of their elders opposed the propagation of Christianity and other interference with their laws and customs.\nLacking effective military might, trained administrative personnel, and funds, the Liberian government could not implement its plans for effective occupation of Liberian territory by building roads, railways, military and administrative posts and Americo-Liberian settlements across its length and breadth, or by co-operating with interior chiefs by paying them regular stipends and inviting them to 'represent' their people in the Liberian legislature as 'referees'. Hence when the Europeans commenced their Scramble in about 1880 (culminating in the Berlin Conference of 1884-5), Liberia seemed likely to lose to them vast stretches of the territory she already claimed.$^{6}$ The Liberian government was therefore concerned during the Scramble primarily to preserve territory it had already acquired."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': 'The outcome of the Scramble and partition for Liberia and Ethiopia', 'content': ""No less hopeless was the internal situation. As indicated above, and for reasons already given above, the Liberian government was perennially nearbankrupt and owed huge debts to local and foreign creditors. By January 1908 Liberia's indebtedness to Britain comprised, according to the British Consul-General at Monrovia, £60000 a year 'for several years' while her indebtedness to German merchants in Liberia amounted to $120000 by September 1905. This indebtedness enabled the imperial powers to constantly interfere in the internal affairs of Liberia during the period under review in a way that they never did in Ethiopia where they were never provided with the cause nor the excuse so to do. Throughout the last three decades of the nineteenth century, the imperial powers sent mission upon mission to Liberia to offer aid to her to pay her debts if she would come under their protection. France did this in 1879, Germany in 1887 and Spain in 1886, and each power offered to regulate Liberia's finances, organize her defence, and establish and control her Frontier Force. At the same time, their resident ambassadors and representatives treated the Liberians with contempt and frequently imposed on her by denouncing her trade, customs and citizenship laws or bullying her to redress their nationals' grievances as Britain did in September 1869, August 1870, April 1871, February and June 1882, November 1886 and finally January 1909. 89 Germany similarly brought in her gunboats to intimidate Liberia in February and October 1881, in August 1897, January and September 1898 and December 1912. On each occasion, the German government demanded financial indemnity ranging between $3000 and $60000 from the Liberian government on mostly trivial grounds, particularly alleged 'insults' by Liberian officials to the German consul or German merchants in Liberia who invited the German intervention.\nThe three years 1907-9 witnessed an unprecedented escalation of this interference by Britain, France and Germany culminating in the famous 'Cadell Incident' of n and 12 February 1909.

Liberia's President from 1904 to 1911, Arthur Barclay, aptly stated the issues at stake, arguing in December 1906 that: Liberia was a recognized state long before the Berlin Conference ... and there might be ground on its part to question some of the dicta laid down at that Conference.

Up to 1914 most of the commissioners were Americo-Liberian or educated indigenous Liberian military officers. The administration was largely oppressive and corrupt. Most of the district commissioners, their aides, and troops, being poorly and irregularly paid, and seldom supervised from Monrovia, lived off their districts by extorting food, labour for their private farms, and excessive fines and taxes (above the official one dollar poll-tax on adult males, and labour required for public buildings and roads). 65 Not surprisingly, the indigenous Africans resisted not only their military subjugation to Liberian government authority - just as Africans elsewhere resisted subjugation to European rule - but also the excesses of the Liberian administration. Until subjugated by the Liberian militia, the Liberian Frontier Force and American naval ships, the Kru resisted intermittently, and particularly in 1915-16; the Grebo resisted in 1910; the Kissi in 1913; the Kpele and Bandi, 1911-14; the Gio and Mano, 1913-18; the Gbolobo Grebo, 1916-18; the Gola and Bandi, 1918-19; the Joquelle Kpele, 1916-20; and the Sikon in 1921.

The Executive was represented in the county - the unit of local administration - by a county superintendent who headed the county's administration. In spite of the President's theoretically vast powers, owing to inadequate means of enforcing executive authority outside Monrovia, considerable political power was wielded by certain AmericoLiberian families at the county level, sometimes extending over several generations, during the Republican and True Whig regimes.

Throughout the nineteenth century, Americo-Liberians' policy was to assimilate the indigenous Africans culturally and politically by 'civilizing' and Christianizing them, and giving them equal rights with the settlers. Although this was achieved to some extent with the Recaptives (who were much less numerous than the settlers), the Americo-Liberians, mindful of their own privileged position, main› tained tight political control over Liberia by restricting political participa› tion of even those indigenous Africans who were educated. Only very few of them were given the franchise on an equal footing with the AmericoLiberians (although these might themselves be illiterate and poor). The main indigenous African representation (mostly of the coastal Africans) in the Liberian Legislature as from 1875 consisted of African chiefs designated 'referees' (or 'delegates'), after their chiefdoms had paid an annual 'delegate fee' of $100 to the Liberian government. As the delegates 'spoke' through an interpreter solely on ethnic matters and could not vote, they had very little influence on government policy.$^{8}$ Hence both the educated Africans and the chiefs resented their restricted representation. Furthermore the Liberian government sought to maximize its import and export duties and other levies on trade and shipping which constituted its main sources of revenue. To facilitate collection and control of the external trade by Americo-Liberian merchants, from 1839 the government restricted foreign merchants to trade at only six Americo-Liberian portsof-entry. The restrictions and levies alienated both the foreign merchants who resented them, and the indigenous African chiefs who had formerly controlled the external trade and levied the dues. Often, the foreign merchants and chiefs combined to resist or defy the trade restrictions and levies, or to appeal to European states to intervene on their behalf. Thus, at various times during the nineteenth century, the Vai, Kru and Grebo of the Liberian coast put up an armed resistance to Liberian government impositions on their trade. 9"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Foreign intervention in Liberia and Ethiopia, 1915-35 > Liberia', 'content': ""Predictably, the United States and British governments reacted to these reports by demanding that the Liberian government should put an end to the so-called military reprisals against the Kru 'pending the conclusion of an arrangement between the League, the United States and Liberia for the future administration of the country'.$^{96}$ The Liberian government on its own part promptly protested to the League against this fresh threat by America and Britain against Liberia's sovereignty.$^{97}$ In addition, President Barclay sent a fact-finding commission of three men led by Winthrop A.

Traditional African communal labour was to replace forced labour for public works; the indigenous Liberians were to be granted an undisputed ownership of their lands, the authority and dignity of the African chiefs were to be upheld by the Liberian government, and the education of the indigenous Liberians and the means of communication with the Liberian hinterland were to be improved.

Simultaneously, some of them revived intra-ethnic conflicts over disputed boundaries, farmlands and chieftainships.\nTo maintain peace and order, President Barclay sent a detachment of the Liberian Frontier Force to the Kru and Grebo districts in May 1931 with specific instructions to its Americo-Liberian commander, Colonel T. Elwood Davis, that the detachment was 'a patrol in force and not a punitive expedition'.$^{94}$ However, in the course of the patrol, fighting broke out between the detachment and the Kru of Sasstown led by their paramount chief, Juah Nimley, which provided fresh grounds for external intervention in Liberian affairs.

However, since Ethiopian leaders including Haile Sellassie were also competent in diplomacy and ardent guardians of their country's sovereignty, the survival of Liberia seems to dwell ultimately in the fact that Ethiopia had a mad, blood-thirsty imperial power as a neighbour who was bent on territorial aggrandizement and above all on avenging Adowa, and therefore on actually attacking Ethiopia.

Considering the proximity of Sierra Leone, and certain treaties and relations of Great Britain with some of the native authorities within the coveted region, this fiat was no slight thing to ask. But, notwithstanding the proverbial modesty of republics, Liberia made up her mind to press for it. She affirmed that she had purchased the sovereignty. At her urgent intreaty, commissioners were finally appointed by the British Government, to agree with her commissioners on a north-western boundary. But when the British commissioners came to investigate the Liberian claims, their shadowy nature was at once apparent.

In the first place, the new 15 per cent. ad valorem import duties would have been exacted from all traders going there. The difference between this and the nominal exactions of the chiefs, or the 4 per cent. ad valorem duties of Sierra Leone, is no unimportant consideration. It would have been monstrous for European or Sierra Leone traders to be mulct in 15 per cent. duties for the import of goods where the Government claiming the 15 per cent. could not give a shred of protection—could have no real sovereignty whatever—but only exercise a something called ""political jurisdiction.""'}, {'id': 1813, 'article_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'full_section_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'last_edit_date': '04-17-1870', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1870#article-7', 'issue_date': '23_05_1870', 'content': 'Sir,—Our mothers, wives, daughters, sisters, and aunts are in stock at Cavalla and Rocktown, where they are subjected daily to horrible atrocities, and intelligence has reached us that they will either be sold into slavery or be slaughtered, every one of them. The reasons are these, Mr. Editor. We the Cape Palmas Town people, the ""Graway,"" and the River Cavalla people, have been in war with the Cavalla and Rocktown people, who took away a piece of land belonging to us on the Cavalla river, which piece of land we had allowed them to plant their rice on, as they had no land to plant upon. The war had been for about seven years, and the last battle we fought was in 1866; since then we never had any actual fight. On the River Cavalla both of us have friends. The Hiddeah people, who are about twenty-five miles from the mouth of the river, are our friends. The ""Tablabo"" people, lower down the river below Hiddeah, are friends to the Cavalla people; so that neither ourselves nor the Cavalla people can go up the river, except we steal by at night. In November, last year, the Tablabo people, who are Cavalla\'s friends, carried war to Hiddeah and killed and wounded four persons. The latter part of January the Hiddeah people carried war to ""Tablabo,"" in return for the war brought to them. When they reached Tablabo Bush-road, going towards the town, they met a man with his war dress on, his war horn, &c. The Hiddeahs asked him in their native tongue who he was; he answered that he was the head war-man (or what we call soldier king) of the Tablabo people. The Hiddeahs fired on him and killed him, after which they returned home, and said, ""We have killed the head war man of Tablabo, our enemy, who brought war against us."" It turned out that this man killed was a Cavalla man, who had gone to Tablabo to assist their friends to fight against the Hiddeahs. The Cavalla people, hearing of the death of this Cavalla man, caught twenty-five of our women and put them in stock; the Rocktown people caught five women and one man, and also put them in stock; these women were passing on the beach going to their daily occupations, when they were caught by the Cavalla people, who said it was us who killed their man. We appealed to the Liberian Government, and the authorities called us and the Hiddeahs, and inquired who of us had killed the man? The Hiddeahs acknowledged they killed the man. The Liberian Government, seeing that we had nothing to do with the death of that man, and that it was done by the Hiddeahs, who were fighting war with the Tablabo, told us they will attend to it, and that in two or three days they would compel the Cavalla people to let our women go. Up to this date three months have passed; our women have not come, but are still in stocks. No doubt the Liberian Government wish to let our women return, but they have no power to enforce it. They are weak and feeble. The Liberian Government make laws, but have no power to enforce them; they speak, but their speech has no effect nor influence whatever. For God\'s sake, Mr. Editor, help us to get our mothers, daughters, sisters, and aunts out of stock, poor innocent women. O, Mr. Editor, shall our mothers, our wives, our sisters, and daughters, be sold into slavery? Will the British Navy and the British Government, to whom we look for protection, allow slavery to revive again, or a great slaughter of human beings? Shall we, after enjoying freedom through the power of Great Britain on the coast of Africa, go back into slavery? What has become of the struggles of the Anti-slavery Society, the loss of life and expenditure, of Her Majesty\'s men-of-war? shall all go in vain? We say again, Mr. Editor, save our mothers, our wives, our daughters, our sisters, and our aunts, from the hand of slavery.

Bush is all that meets the eye, while not a sail is to be seen as far as the eye can reach. There are no towns of any size between Grand Bassa and Harper, but merely a few villages scattered at intervals along the coast. Harper is situated on Cape Palmas, and has a harbour immediately opposite, which is sufficiently commodious and affords ships cruising in this part of the world a pleasant change after the eternal surf of the West African shores. The town looks uncommonly well from the sea. The church spires peep out from amongst the trees, and the shingle-framed houses of the Liberians surrounded by gardens add picturesqueness to the scene. Harper possesses, besides old churches, an academy, a hospital, an orphan asylum, and a lighthouse. The latter is more of ornament than use, as the Republic cannot afford to keep it constantly lighted. Adjacent to the lighthouse is the flagstaff which bears the Liberian national flag, the same as the American ensign, with the exception that instead of many stars there is only one. The practically prohibitive taxation at present imposed by the Government will end in the withdrawal of all Europeans from the country, as it is now an impossibility to get at the interior of the country, and the amount of trade that can be indulged in at the open ports is not sufficiently remunerative in view of the heavy taxation imposed. At present the German traders are anxiously expecting the arrival of the German squadron from Europe, when they are hoping the Admiral in command will bring the requisite pressure to bear on the authorities to induce them to open out to them the interior of the country. The people here may be called prosperous; if they would not ape white men\'s ways, they would be all the better. Some are well educated, and quite *au fait* in the politics of the world, but they appear to have a great dislike to foreigners of any kind, and a wish to keep Liberia wholly and solely for the Liberians. It should be pointed out that the effect of present restrictions is to keep Liberia utterly impotent to enforce her authority within her territory, and to prevent her doing anything to advance the material condition of the country, and that if this policy be persisted in, the inevitable result would be that Liberia would be absorbed by a European Power. The Americans washed their hands of a Liberian protectorate years ago, and are not likely to embroil themselves with any Power over such a figment as ""Liberian independence."" The officials of the Republic are wretchedly paid. The Governor of Harper\'s income is only about £75 a-year; his house is furnished in the meanest style, and he appears to augment his salary by supplying ships with fresh provisions. The constitution of Liberia, as well as the institutions, the manners and customs of the people, and the language itself, appear to be modelled upon those of the United States. The pure Liberian guesses and calculates quite as much as do his white brothers in New York, and speaks with that nasal twang peculiar to the land of the stars and stripes. Manhood suffrage is one of the Liberian institutions, but this ""manhood suffrage"" involves the qualification of being possessed of real property to the extent of fifty dollars. Harper exports little but palm oil, and that little appears to be dwindling to still lower limits. The inhabitants appear to take a deep interest in politics, and elections and the state of parties seem to create as deep and universal interest here as in more civilized countries. A Liberian youth of sixteen or so being asked how often the President was elected, replied ""biennially,"" and proceeded to give an account of the political institutions of the country, which showed that the education of the Liberian youth is thorough, and embraces politics as well as more widely-taught subjects. The President of the Republic resides at Monrovia, the capital, where the Houses of Assembly sit. The salary attached to the Presidential office is only £400 a-year and a residence—not a very magnificent sum, but large enough in this country, where living is cheap, the expenses of life small. The solitary Englishman in Liberia is located at a place called Tabon, and is engaged in trading with the natives. He has for some time refused to pay the exorbitant taxes assessed upon him, and the Government has no force to compel him, with the result that many of the natives are inclined to follow his example. As the Government has no means of transport, they are unable to send any troops from Monrovia to Tabon, from which it is distant about 200 miles, and, probably, even if they could, they would hesitate to do so from fear of complications with the English Government, especially as the boundaries of Liberia are not at present clearly defined, and her Majesty\'s Government has declined to recognize any portion of the country to be Liberian territory when the Government of the country is not capable of enforcing its authority. The officials say that the President has invoked the assistance of the United States, and that an American ship is at present on its way to Tabon, to set matters right; but the Americans are much too cute to trouble themselves over such a paltry matter. A wide and deep river runs into the sea here, but it is ruined by a bar at its mouth, which prevents navigation. This matters little at the present time, but in the future, when Liberia has been annexed or roused from its present state of stagnation, means will probably be found to obviate this fatal impediment to navigation, both here and elsewhere, along the coast. A very few miles off, another large river—the Carallo—discharges itself into the sea, and is likely to become of great commercial importance in the future, as gold washings have been found on its banks. This river has been ascended for nearly 200 miles, and is stated to be navigable for that distance. This country is more valuable in every way than our Gold Coast Colony: it possesses three or four fairly good harbours, whereas the latter cannot boast of one. There is an absence of that terrible surf which makes landing or the transference of cargo almost impossible, and the country itself appears to be more productive, to have greater mineral wealth, and to ""tap"" a more valuable part of the Dark Continent. The estimated population of Liberia is about 767,000, only about 30,000 of whom are descendants of freed slaves from the United States, the remainder being the aborigines or ""heathen,"" as they are termed by the ""Liberians.""'}, {'id': 6218, 'article_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'full_section_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'last_edit_date': '06-01-1892', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1892#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_06_1892', 'content': ""The first Governor, Buchanan, died in 1841, and was succeeded by Governor Roberts, whose name is well known in connexion with Liberian history. The civilised population at this time numbered about 5,000, but Liberia's position as a State in Africa resembled that of its founders as individuals in America. It had no legal existence among the nations. This fact was made apparent by the refusal of foreign ships to pay the duties imposed by its Legislature. The natives of the coast continued to harass it in consequence of its opposition to the slave trade, until the new State found itself between an upper and a nether millstone. Governor Roberts applied himself to overcome each difficulty in turn. He succeeded in persuading the native chiefs to appreciate the advantages of civilisation, and a number were induced to federate for the purpose of abolishing slavery and introducing orderly administration within their borders. The federated body shortly afterwards entered the colony, and in 1845 the territory of the Kroomen was annexed by friendly treaty, thus adding a third county, under the name of Sinou, to the two which already existed. The colony now extended to Grand Sesters. Maryland also widened the area of her administration, and the entire coast was occupied from Cape Mount to San Pedro. The two colonies resolved to make a joint effort at self-assertion. They imposed an ad valorem customs duty of 6 per cent. upon foreign imports, but English merchants refused to admit the right of the Liberians to impose duties, and insisted upon trading freely as with a savage territory. An English ship was seized and detained by the Liberian authorities. It was rescued by force, and the English Government refused to recognise the Liberian Executive. Liberia had no position except as a dependency of the United States, and the prejudice against colour in America caused that Government to give only lukewarm support to the African colony. If it were to exist at all, it was necessary that it should assert its individuality and claim for itself the rights which were denied to it. Under these circumstances the American Colonisation Society came to the resolution to abandon all rights over its protégé and advised it to take its fate boldly into its own hands. A Republican constitution was drawn up, and on August 24, 1847, the existence of the Republic of Liberia was announced to the world.""}, {'id': 6250, 'article_title': 'THE FUTURE OF LIBERIA.', 'full_section_title': 'THE FUTURE OF LIBERIA.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1892#article-4', 'issue_date': '01_09_1892', 'content': 'How many Englishmen have visited Liberia? Five hundred, perhaps, at the most. It lies far away from the routes pursued by tourists, and the busy world hears little and knows less of the independent negro State which nestles in a corner of the West African Coast and has been the scene of a series of experiments absolutely unique in history. It was from this part of the African coast that some attempt was to be made to develop the Dark Continent. Emancipated slaves from the United States, now citizens of a republic established by themselves in the land of their forefathers, were to be the torchbearers of civilisation and to carry the lamp of learning to their brethren in the interior. Such was the scheme of the large-hearted and liberal philanthropists who, early in the present century, founded the various colonisation societies in the United States with a view of enabling its negro population to found settlements on the West Coast of Africa. These settlements were gradually formed, and, after passing through a series of trials, eventually confederated. In 1822 the republic was declared, and in 1847 Liberia was recognised as an independent State by the sovereigns of Europe and the United States Government. From Washington the new State borrowed its constitution. Although she has enjoyed the advantage of having had at least three Presidents—E. Johnson, Russworm, and Roberts—of high character and executive ability, it would be untrue to say that the hopes of the founders of Liberia have been realised. On the contrary the Liberian Government seems to have entirely failed to win the confidence or even to gain the respect of the native kings and tribes within its supposed ""sphere of influence""; indeed, some of them resist all attempts to enforce authority within the ill-defined boundaries of the State. At the recent inauguration of the new President—the Hon. — Cheeseman—it was a matter of general satisfaction that a gunboat, ordered from a Keil dockyard, was on her way out from Germany. This boat is to be the foundation of the new Liberian Navy, and, strange to say, it is required, not for the defence of the State, but to coerce a British merchant who for three years has declined to pay customs duty on the ground that he receives no protection from Government, that there is no civilised administration in the district in which he resides, and that he is compelled to employ and pay a police force of his own. The Government, urged by German merchants to suppress their independent competitor, has signified its intention of resorting to force, and will probably find itself in a difficulty with our Foreign Office if a single shot is fired on an English factory whose owner is considered to have made out a good case for non-payment of duty. The attempts of Christian missionaries to evangelise the Western districts of Africa have been discouraging. From the year 1481, when some priests from Rome unsuccessfully endeavoured to withstand the climate, the history of Christian labour is one continuous narrative of a futile struggle against disease and death. Protestant societies in the United States have literally poured dollars by thousands into Liberia. Some good work is being done by white ministers who have formed thriving settlements up the country (where the land is fertile and the climate healthy), and have urged upon the natives the importance of cultivating rice, corn, potatoes, ginger, sugar, coffee, and arrowroot, all of which are remunerative crops. As for cotton, indigo, pepper, pineapples, and gumtrees, they grow wild, and the superior knowledge of the missionaries has enabled the natives to gather them profitably. But Christian workers have to reckon with a foe more stubborn than Paganism. Islam is gradually winning its way towards the West Coast from the interior. The sword, it is true, goes hand in hand with the green banner, but the African negro is a ready convert. He finds the precepts of the Prophet easy to understand, and the sanction of polygamy is in entire accord with his present practice. Moreover, where Mahomet gains ground, intemperance—which unhappily follows Christian missions—disappears. I have said that Liberia is fertile. It is certainly the richest district in West Africa, but it is terribly neglected, and can never thrive under its present administration. There is practically no Government. The rule of the negro is marked by selfishness and corruption. The colonisation societies in the United States have almost abandoned in despair sending out more emigrants who, on landing, finding themselves free from control, quickly become lazy and wholly useless as pioneers for opening up fresh country. It must be confessed, therefore, that, after a trial of seventy years, the American negroes have failed to erect a State worthy of the name. They have lost what little credit they had twenty years ago—not even the interest is paid on the loan of 500,000 dols. raised in London in 1870—and Liberia is gradually drifting into the hands of a few wide-awake German merchants, who are understood to have made advances to Government against valuable securities, as well as to have exerted sufficient influence in Berlin to induce General Caprivi to protest in vigorous language against the concession known as the ""indiarubber monopoly,"" granted by President Johnson to an English syndicate of company promoters under circumstances which have been severely criticised. Lord Salisbury was aware of the facts, but it yet remains to be seen whether the British Government will raise its voice against a German protectorate of Liberia.—""E.

Mr. Woodin was most kindly received at the Foreign Office, and was promised that everything possible would be done in the case. He was most anxious about his two agents—Englishmen—who had been arrested, and was told that a cablegram would be sent to Sierra Leone for the governor to follow up the matter instantly. Mr. Woodin says, in the absence of particulars, he cannot explain or understand the action of the Liberians. He has been trading at Cavally for the past four years, and much of this time the Beatrice has been there. The Liberians at one time established a blockade of the place, but subsequently raised it, and the latest advices showed that peace had been declared, and the Cavally natives had still their independence. If the Liberians, who have one little vessel fitted with two Nordenfelt guns, had re-established the blockade, a declaration of such should have been made, as in the previous case, when any vessel would have an opportunity to clear out. As regards any question of Customs duty, Mr. Woodin says he has never been asked to pay any, as the place is perfectly free. Cavally has always been ruled by the natives of the place, and although Liberia has asserted claims to it she has never put her pretentions into practice. The only ports of entry for goods into the country of Liberia are as follows, and these are given to shippers by the Liberian Consul at Liverpool: Roberts Port, Monrovia, Marshall, Grand Bassa, Greenville, and Cape Palmas. No mention whatever is made of Cavally. The last steamer to arrive in this country from Cavally was the steamer Volta, and Captain Rutherford was told by the commander of H.M.S. Blonde that the blockade by the Liberians had been withdrawn and peace restored. Captain Rutherford was as usual able to land and receive passengers at Cavally both on his outward and homeward voyages. All this goes to show that the action of the Liberians was very arbitrary. Mr. Woodin's greatest anxiety is for the welfare of his white agents, who, if incarcerated in a prison in West Africa, would be in actual peril of their lives. Mr. Woodin also put his case before Mr. A. L. Jones, of Liverpool, who is personally known to President Cheeseman of Liberia.

The communication touches on many features in the present system of the West African trade, and ultimately it was agreed that it would be impracticable to apply the practices of trade as carried on in civilised countries to West Africa, where circumstances are so dissimilar. The ports of entry of Liberia are far apart, and the intervening villages are not in communication with such ports either by roads or water communication. The power of Liberia over large sections of the State is only nominal, and it has no representative at many places on the coast. Kroo labour is not always to be obtained at the ports of entry, and so great is the risk incurred by landing in hostile parts, that the Kroomen prefer to be carried to a British port rather than have to make their way through unfriendly tribes and the bush to their own villages. Both trade and liberties would suffer by any hasty change in the circumstances under which commerce with Africa is being developed.

It was ascertained by those on board the Nubia that the Natives of Settra Kroo, who have always disputed Liberian sovereignty over their country, had forced their way to the back of Sinoe, and had cut off all communication with the interior. The Settra Kroo Natives had not come down to the seaboard at Sinoe, as there the gunboat could have dealt with them, but they had been the means of stopping the trade of the place.

Bush is all that meets the eye, while not a sail is to be seen as far as the eye can reach. There are no towns of any size between Grand Bassa and Harper, but merely a few villages scattered at intervals along the coast. Harper is situated on Cape Palmas, and has a harbour immediately opposite, which is sufficiently commodious and affords ships cruising in this part of the world a pleasant change after the eternal surf of the West African shores. The town looks uncommonly well from the sea. The church spires peep out from amongst the trees, and the shingle-framed houses of the Liberians surrounded by gardens add picturesqueness to the scene. Harper possesses, besides old churches, an academy, a hospital, an orphan asylum, and a lighthouse. The latter is more of ornament than use, as the Republic cannot afford to keep it constantly lighted. Adjacent to the lighthouse is the flagstaff which bears the Liberian national flag, the same as the American ensign, with the exception that instead of many stars there is only one. The practically prohibitive taxation at present imposed by the Government will end in the withdrawal of all Europeans from the country, as it is now an impossibility to get at the interior of the country, and the amount of trade that can be indulged in at the open ports is not sufficiently remunerative in view of the heavy taxation imposed. At present the German traders are anxiously expecting the arrival of the German squadron from Europe, when they are hoping the Admiral in command will bring the requisite pressure to bear on the authorities to induce them to open out to them the interior of the country. The people here may be called prosperous; if they would not ape white men\'s ways, they would be all the better. Some are well educated, and quite *au fait* in the politics of the world, but they appear to have a great dislike to foreigners of any kind, and a wish to keep Liberia wholly and solely for the Liberians. It should be pointed out that the effect of present restrictions is to keep Liberia utterly impotent to enforce her authority within her territory, and to prevent her doing anything to advance the material condition of the country, and that if this policy be persisted in, the inevitable result would be that Liberia would be absorbed by a European Power. The Americans washed their hands of a Liberian protectorate years ago, and are not likely to embroil themselves with any Power over such a figment as ""Liberian independence."" The officials of the Republic are wretchedly paid. The Governor of Harper\'s income is only about £75 a-year; his house is furnished in the meanest style, and he appears to augment his salary by supplying ships with fresh provisions. The constitution of Liberia, as well as the institutions, the manners and customs of the people, and the language itself, appear to be modelled upon those of the United States. The pure Liberian guesses and calculates quite as much as do his white brothers in New York, and speaks with that nasal twang peculiar to the land of the stars and stripes. Manhood suffrage is one of the Liberian institutions, but this ""manhood suffrage"" involves the qualification of being possessed of real property to the extent of fifty dollars. Harper exports little but palm oil, and that little appears to be dwindling to still lower limits. The inhabitants appear to take a deep interest in politics, and elections and the state of parties seem to create as deep and universal interest here as in more civilized countries. A Liberian youth of sixteen or so being asked how often the President was elected, replied ""biennially,"" and proceeded to give an account of the political institutions of the country, which showed that the education of the Liberian youth is thorough, and embraces politics as well as more widely-taught subjects. The President of the Republic resides at Monrovia, the capital, where the Houses of Assembly sit. The salary attached to the Presidential office is only £400 a-year and a residence—not a very magnificent sum, but large enough in this country, where living is cheap, the expenses of life small. The solitary Englishman in Liberia is located at a place called Tabon, and is engaged in trading with the natives. He has for some time refused to pay the exorbitant taxes assessed upon him, and the Government has no force to compel him, with the result that many of the natives are inclined to follow his example. As the Government has no means of transport, they are unable to send any troops from Monrovia to Tabon, from which it is distant about 200 miles, and, probably, even if they could, they would hesitate to do so from fear of complications with the English Government, especially as the boundaries of Liberia are not at present clearly defined, and her Majesty\'s Government has declined to recognize any portion of the country to be Liberian territory when the Government of the country is not capable of enforcing its authority. The officials say that the President has invoked the assistance of the United States, and that an American ship is at present on its way to Tabon, to set matters right; but the Americans are much too cute to trouble themselves over such a paltry matter. A wide and deep river runs into the sea here, but it is ruined by a bar at its mouth, which prevents navigation. This matters little at the present time, but in the future, when Liberia has been annexed or roused from its present state of stagnation, means will probably be found to obviate this fatal impediment to navigation, both here and elsewhere, along the coast. A very few miles off, another large river—the Carallo—discharges itself into the sea, and is likely to become of great commercial importance in the future, as gold washings have been found on its banks. This river has been ascended for nearly 200 miles, and is stated to be navigable for that distance. This country is more valuable in every way than our Gold Coast Colony: it possesses three or four fairly good harbours, whereas the latter cannot boast of one. There is an absence of that terrible surf which makes landing or the transference of cargo almost impossible, and the country itself appears to be more productive, to have greater mineral wealth, and to ""tap"" a more valuable part of the Dark Continent. The estimated population of Liberia is about 767,000, only about 30,000 of whom are descendants of freed slaves from the United States, the remainder being the aborigines or ""heathen,"" as they are termed by the ""Liberians.""', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Boundary Commissioners have not settled anything. The Republic, which has an American fondness for stretching out, demands that the Shebar and the Jong River shall constitute the northern limit of Liberia. But the British Commissioners are stated to have been inflexible on the point that the south bank of the Big River should mark the utmost northern extension of the young and ambitious Republic. The British Commissioners have, therefore, gone their way, and the Liberian authorities continue their claim to the Shebar as the boundary.\n\nThere are many important considerations involved in this question. We have not time or space to enter upon them on this occasion. We shall merely say that, despite all assertions to the contrary, when we regard the state of the public revenue, and the disposable forces in Liberia, we are constrained to believe that it would be at present impossible for the Republic, without a most injurious, if not fatal exhaustion, to force the Gallinas to acknowledge her sway, even should the British Government admit her claims to extension as far as the Shebar. We must say that we consider the Gallinas would be a fatal gift to her—or, if not fatal, a most disastrous one for many generations. She has a sufficient stretch of coast without this northern extension; and toward the interior her boundaries are necessarily of the most elastic kind, and the territories ready for her appropriation, whenever she may be able to occupy them, are such as would afford suitable ""locations"" for millions of American immigrants. The climate of the interior, too, is far more healthy than that of the Liberian coast districts; which, among the unhealthy, are proverbially so. The revenue of the Republic scarcely suffices, at present, for the salaries of the Government functionaries; and as it increases, any surplus will be far better appropriated to the extension of good roads and improvement of rivers into the interior than to war on the northern frontier.\n\nAn American engineer, a Mr. Morris, introduced a coffee huller into Liberia, for cracking the very hard exterior shell of the Liberian coffee. When he showed its capabilities it was much praised, and that was something akin to public enthusiasm about it. But before importing any for sale, he demanded a patent protection. This he has great difficulty in obtaining. The Liberians are so innocent and naïve, that ""they cannot conceive what on earth he wants with a patent; why cannot he bring in some machines at once and sell them?"" The Liberians have a keen eye for the ""Almighty Dollar."" The Republic ought to become rapidly wealthy, possessing, as it does, such vast natural resources.\n\nThe Liberian journals are, we regret to see, almost exclusively occupied with the acrimonious quarrel between Mr. (now ex-) President Benson and Mr. Lynch, to which we have before alluded.

We have been long ago convinced that the English Government would never have gone to all the trouble it has unless it had designs looking to territorial aggrandizement southward of Sherbro\'. That Government now gives plain utterance to that at which its agents have been hinting a long time ago. The Liberian Government has not been wise in its generation. It has attempted to trade upon the supposed philanthropy of its rival, and it is likely to suffer in consequence. If Liberia does lose her northern territories, it is to be hoped that her statesmen will take to heart the lesson that from the day she declared her independence she was expected to have learned: that the era of philanthropy for her was over. She was to fight her own battles, look out for her own interests, stand up for her own rights. Failing to do this, she would suffer the consequences. Now in all the controversy about our North-west boundary we have blindly followed the path traced out by the English Government. We have done nothing that it was thought would offend. Their traders went into Mannah country. We enforced the laws they had ignored, were threatened with chastisement, paid an indemnity, saying we should protest, which we never formally did, and now we are told that we never protested—therefore it is an admission against us. Previous to the time of the Sulymah meeting, the English sent agents into the territory to collect evidence adverse to us, and paid for such evidence. We, although we had strong backers in the disputed territories, never made an effort to look after our interests and strengthen our case. Nor did we raise a single objection to the proceedings of the English Colonial Government. It might displease them; they would do right. Well, they have done right. They have cooked up a spurious claim made by a lot of exceedingly doubtful character, purporting to have been sworn in before magistrates influenced by traders known to be anxious for the acquisition of the country by Great Britain; and now they say, ""This is good claim; we must believe our citizens and our magistrates in preference to yours; give up the territory for the claim."" That the Cabinet was actually ready to fall in with the views of the English is heart-rending. Without animadversion, it certainly can be said with truth that they have disappointed the country. The protest transmitted by the citizens of Monrovia to the President truthfully points out the reason why we cannot accede without at least a struggle to the demands of the English Government. It would be but the beginning of the end. The territorial acquisitions which Great Britain contemplates making at our expense would practically place the northern boundary of Liberia at the St. Paul\'s River. Everything that can be done should be resorted to avert such a disaster, and we do hope the Government, which now seems to be asleep, will awake and strive to inaugurate a policy conservative of the interests of the country.""', 'last_edit_date': '1882-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1882#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Obstacles to Progress in Liberia', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—It is more than thirty years since I immigrated to this country, and ever since I can remember there has always been a sort of drag in everything. We are kept down in this place next to servitude; our will is not our own; a few men who are in command of a little property keep us knuckle down to them. If we are in their employment we are seldom paid in money, but are obliged to take up such estables as they choose to give us. If a captain or supercargo comes, and wishes to give some of the enterprising young men of this place a little trust, these merchants here, though doing business on trust themselves, will oppose it, and advise the parties not to give them trust. If any of us try to do a little trading whereby we may progress, we are opposed, oppressed, and all kind of stratagems will be used to prevent our success. Hence we are living here not in harmony and love; every man is opposed to the progress of his neighbour in whatever pursuit he follows; whether it be in the mercantile line or farming, it seems as a dagger driven into us to see any one else prosper; very few sympathise with their fellow-citizen when misfortune happens to him, and fewer still will give any aid except for a large reward. Even the immigrants who are invited by us from America to come and help us to build up this black nationality, when they come out, except they possess a little money, are looked down upon with disdain and contempt by the other citizens; any advantages that can be taken of them will be taken. Sometimes we may be paid by the merchants when we are in their employment in Liberian currency, and if without leaving the store we give them back the currency for the purchase of some article in their store, they refuse to take the very currency they paid us, demanding specie of us; and if they do take it, it will be at a discount; and when foreigners come here to reside among us to do business, whether they be our colour or white men, whereby we can get articles cheaper, be employed, and the country built up for our benefit, the majority of people are against them, and they will try everything in their power to entrap them in law-suits; they will go to their places of business, abuse, insult, curse and swear at them, and some of our young men, when in the employment of foreigners, will skulk away a part of their time in idleness; and if their employers bring them up for it they will question their authority in doing so, and begin to speak of their freedom, and demand full pay for the time they have wasted in idleness; and if the foreigners refuse to pay them they are taken to law and made to pay, for our laws, Mr. Editor, are all one-sided. No foreigners or new-comers expect to get justice in Liberia; if they do, they will certainly drain the pockets well first. Whether this is done from the ignorance of the people, or whether they are influenced by the few merchants here, I cannot say; one thing I know, that this is a practice in the Republic, to take all advantage they can of foreigners, that they may be discouraged and leave the country. I am a supporter of foreigners, for without foreigners we cannot live. America receives into her country immigrants of all nations. The Dutchman finds a home and welcome; he brings with him skill and science, and puts them in operation. The Frenchman, the Englishman, the German, and Italian find welcome hands beckoning them to come; therefore America has advanced to what she is this day. Why can\'t Liberia stretch out her hands to all nations, and invite them into her country? Why can\'t Liberia open her ""Constitution,"" and allow all nations to come in and build her up? Why do Liberians take advantage of foreigners and strangers, and combine together against them? These are the things that keep us from progressing. Since our Government was a Government it has been in an embarrassed state; never was Liberia able to redeem her currency in gold and silver, as she reports. These things can be easily remedied if better steps were to be taken, and selfishness and self-conceit put away.', 'last_edit_date': '1869-05-08', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1869#article-29', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Great Britain was the first Power to hold out a helping hand, and a British man-of-war was sent to Monrovia to offer a salute of twenty-one guns to the new flag.

President Roberts, who undertook a tour through Europe for the purpose of obtaining the recognition of the Powers, was well received in England, and was not only able to conclude a commercial treaty, but was accepted as an ally in the prosecution of the campaign against the slave trade on the West African coast, and was presented with a gunboat to enable him to carry on the repression of the traffic in Liberian waters. He, in 1849, took an active part in an expedition of the Powers against the slade traders, who had their headquarters in the northern territory lying between Liberia and Sierra Leone. It was felt that if the whole coast could be held under anti-slavery supervision the trade might be extirpated, and in 1850 the West Coast territory to Cape Turner was purchased from the owners and placed under the guardianship of Liberia. Robertsport was founded this year, and commemorates the name of the President. The population of the Republic was rapidly increasing, her territory was extended towards the interior by treaties with the chiefs, and in 1857 the colony of Maryland was by its own request annexed. They now form together the United States of Liberia. Trade and agriculture were encouraged, and order, justice, and civilised institutions spread through the Republic. The restriction by which white men were forbidden to hold land was also removed. Towns were multiplied and exploration of the interior began to attract attention.

We have read it attentively, but we cannot find in it that dependable rectification of errors in King Weah’s statement, published by us last month, which we had looked for. Having received constant and minute intelligence from Cape Palmas, from the period of the advent of the Liberian Commissioner there, we discover that there are important omissions in the Report; nor are we at all satisfied that King Weah’s statements are incorrect as regards either of the two great points—viz., the commencement of warlike operations and the territorial claims. We are surprised at the failure of the Report on these points, because, if there be one thing more than another in which the public men in Liberia have excelled, it has been in the drawing up of their Reports, Presidential Messages, and other State documents; and still more surprised, because many portions of the Report are written with a most charming air of sincerity and good feeling, becoming the character and position of the Commissioner. The Commissioner states that there was a warlike demonstration of the natives on the 10th of August, and that on the following day some of them began deliberately to fire on the Hoffman Mission Station. He then adds: “Thus war began, as far as I know the facts.” As the Commissioner was at Cape Palmas at that time, he must have had a personal knowledge of the facts had they been such as he relates; and the impression produced on our mind is that, not himself believing the statement to be altogether true, he was too conscientious to vouch for it. Then as regards the Land question. The Special Commissioner states that the object of the combination among the natives is “the re-possession of the territory,” which involves rights and powers that would be incompatible with the fiscal arrangements of the Liberian Government; that the natives “deny that the Liberian Government has acquired the domain; that they declare themselves the masters; that they ignore the deed of purchase by the Maryland Colonization Society, and assert that the articles therein mentioned were paid to them for landing the immigrants and building their huts.” Looking to probabilities, we cannot believe that the natives sold the entire lands of their country, and their own right of free action, but only the lands on which they permitted the immigrants of the Colonization Society to settle, assisting them in landing, building their huts, &c. We must frankly state, however, that we do not attach much importance to this. Liberia has become an organized and recognized State, with institutions framed and established on the model of the United States of America.

A. Rutherford, of the British & African Steam Navigation Company, arrived in the Mersey from West Africa on July 17.

The Volta left Rocktown on June 24, and the battle took place three days before. The Liberian troops numbered about 400, and the fight occupied the whole of the day. The Liberians retreated in the evening, and left the field in the possession of the natives of Rocktown. The battle really took place on the beach, between Cape Palmas and Rocktown. The Rocktown boys captured a brass cannon from the enemy and a white flag. It was difficult to get the precise figures as to the number of the killed, but it was believed that the Liberians lost about thirty killed, and the Rocktown boys about fifteen or twenty. The Rocktown boys turned the captured cannon on the Liberian gunboat, but the shots did not strike her. The gunboat nevertheless got out of the cannon's range. It seems that at one time the Liberians flew the white flag, but the Rocktown boys not understanding it fired into the ranks of the Liberians and continued the fight. Great excitement prevailed at Grand Bassa when the news of the defeat of the Liberians reached that place. The cause of the hostilities is that Liberia lays claim to Rocktown, and insists upon her laws and regulations being observed there. The Greeboes (the Rocktown natives) profess complete independence. The King of Rocktown asked Captain Rutherford to wait, as he was writing a letter to Queen Victoria telling her Majesty about the war. The Volta had about forty Rocktown boys as passengers, and most of them landed in their canoes, but before all of them could get away the Liberian man-of-war Gorronammah came up, and ordered her away, at the same time demanding that the Rocktown boys be given up to her. The boys on seeing the gunboat approach hid themselves in all parts of the ship, and Captain Rutherford declined to hand them over to the war vessel. The boys told Captain Rutherford that had he given them up they would have been killed.

The first independent civilized African State on the West Coast, she occupies a position of great honour and usefulness. With institutions framed on the model of those of the United States of America, she stands out boldly before the world asserting and proving that there is no lack of natural ability in the civilized African to work the machinery of free institutions. Her President, her judges, her learned professors, are Christian Africans; no white man holds any political position in the country; the nation is essentially negro, and is so far from feeling any need of European or American aid in carrying on the various departments of her government, that she does more than discourage, she prohibits the permanent settlement of white men within her borders. They may come there for purposes of trade, but they are not permitted to acquire landed property; African she is, and exclusively African she is determined to remain. The enemies and libellers of the African race not unfrequently point to Liberia with contempt and ridicule, because she has not obtained in infancy the development of manhood; because, having no capital but what has been created by the industry of her own people, she is not able to undertake those works of civilization which are so much needed for the rapid development of her great natural resources; because, amid the abundant elements of wealth existing in her rich tropical fertility, and with her capability of producing so many objects that Europe requires and is compelled to seek even at the opposite side of the world, her Government is poor, and her revenue insufficient, without constant patriotic self-denial on the part of her principal citizens, for the support of those establishments indispensable to a free Christian State, which includes within her borders a native heathen population more than twenty times exceeding in number the civilized population of which the State really consists. But so far from there being anything in her public condition to justify contempt and ridicule such as our ignorantly-learned anthropologists would heap upon her and her people, every impartial man will find cause in her for wonder and felicitation that a mere handful of people brought to the African Coast from the degrading servitude of the late Slave States of the great American Republic should have fallen into so few errors, and have made such rapid progress. For it must be especially borne in mind that no comparison between Liberia and an English colony would be fair. An English colony, however small the number of emigrants and their descendants may be, is constantly and from its very birth receiving assistance from realized British capital. But the African emigrants from the United States to Liberia have not had any such resources at their back. They or their fathers have been slaves; and their only means of reaching Liberia was by the gift of a free passage, with six months free support after arrival, by the Colonization Society which founded this refuge for emancipated slaves on the West Coast of Africa. There have been no African Crusoes to help to build up this African Republic; the wealth, whatever it may be, within her is only the surplus of what her own people have created, over and above what they required for their own support. The progress thus made must necessarily be slow in comparison with that of an English colony anywhere, although it may be, as it has been in reality, rapid when viewed only in connexion with the elements available for promoting it. But we hope and believe that the time is now approaching when that progress will be greatly stimulated. Liberia, formed of American Africans, strongly imbued with the Republican principles so extreme in the American people, is not likely to attract any new elements of wealth and population from any other country than that from which its present civilized population has been derived. Ardently desiring as we do to see a rapid advance in Liberia, we rejoiced when we foresaw, as an inevitable consequence of the civil war in the United States, an increased emigration of emancipated Africans from those states to Liberia. The extreme change in the position of the late slaves in America, who have been so suddenly elevated from a debasing bondage, from a condition in which they were estimated rather as beasts than as men, to the full privileges of citizenship, political as well as social, has, however, retarded that movement toward Africa which would otherwise have impelled large numbers of the emancipated to Liberia. Still, the desire to become citizens of an exclusively African Republic, and that in Africa, has been gradually spreading in America, and the Colonization Society, who sent a shipload of emigrants in November last, and another in May, will despatch their ship again in November next with a further addition of some 800 for the African Republic. From the published statements of the society we have reason to believe that 4,000 or 5,000 emigrants might have been sent to Liberia during the present year, instead of some 1,500, had the society been in possession of the requisite funds. We must express our hope that the Colonization Society will be able to obtain all the money it may require to realize the spontaneous desires of late American slaves to become Liberian citizens. It is only by a large increase in her civilized industrial population that Liberia can make rapid progress in production and wealth.

950,Liberia's establishment and territorial ambitions have hindered rather than benefited the surrounding African regions due to limited resources and military power.,"The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that Liberia's establishment and territorial ambitions have hindered rather than benefited the surrounding African regions due to limited resources and military power. The General History of Africa highlights Liberia's military inadequacies, characterized by a poorly trained and equipped militia and ineffective transportation, which left it vulnerable to European encroachment during the Scramble for Africa. This weakness is contrasted with Ethiopia's military strength, which enabled it to maintain sovereignty. Liberia's internal economic and social issues, including chronic indebtedness and foreign control over its financial administration, further weakened its territorial ambitions. Attempts to expand were thwarted by European annexations, such as the British and French taking over parts of Liberia, facilitated by its lack of effective occupation and military power. Additionally, the oppressive administration over indigenous groups led to resistance, straining resources further. The African Times echoes these points, noting Liberia's struggle to assert control over its territories and its inability to enforce sovereignty, which would have imposed detrimental trade duties. The articles also highlight Liberia's military defeats, such as in Rocktown, and its dissatisfaction with territorial limits, leading to tensions with neighbors and European powers. Financial struggles and the inability to attract capital or develop infrastructure further hampered Liberia's governance and territorial claims. Together, these observations suggest that Liberia's limited resources and military power not only hindered its territorial ambitions but also negatively impacted the surrounding regions by failing to provide stability or protection against European imperialism.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that align with the claim that Liberia's establishment and territorial ambitions have hindered rather than benefited the surrounding African regions due to limited resources and military power.

Additionally, Liberia's military weakness is evident in its failure to conquer and hold territories, as seen in the conflict with the natives of Rocktown, where Liberian forces were defeated (Paragraph 7). The articles also mention Liberia's dissatisfaction with its territorial limits and its unfulfilled ambitions to expand, which have led to tensions with neighboring regions and European powers (Paragraphs 4 and 5).

Thereafter, up to about 1906, over 18000 New World Africans mostly aided by the ACS settled, annually, in Liberia in congeries of over thirty towns close to the Atlantic littoral on land obtained by the ACS or the Liberian government from the African chiefs of the region.

Liberia, therefore, *must* possess those lands, which with their population must form part of the Liberian territory and people. The natives deny the alleged right of the Liberians by purchase; the Liberians are not powerful enough to conquer and hold the territory and the natives in subjection by force of arms. There is only one course, therefore, to pursue, which is, to draw these natives and their territories into the State by a wise and conciliatory Administration—by making the natives partakers of the benefits of free institutions, admitting their educated men to a share in all the rights and privileges and emoluments of the Republic, and repressing with a just severity such actions of the Cape Palmas people as have been reasonably enough complained of by the Gedeboes. The difficulty is for Liberia to do all that is really necessary with the very limited public resources that her Government can command. We fear she may not be able to do what is really necessary unless she can obtain more ample resources. If she be really thus hindered, she must devise means for the introduction of that capital which is her great want. She cannot make her roads, bridge her rivers, and effect the other territorial improvements essential and indispensable to development and prosperity, without that capital. We certainly believe that she could attract that capital by changes in her land regulations. Let her make those changes, and invite that capital. She has a vast latent territorial wealth that cannot be realized without it, but would be speedily made available under its judicious application. We and other warm friends of Liberia thus advised the late President Benson when he was in England in 1861-2. Much valuable time has been lost. That loss is, of course, irretrievable; but the present and future are at the disposal of Liberia.

That Government now gives plain utterance to that at which its agents have been hinting a long time ago. The Liberian Government has not been wise in its generation. It has attempted to trade upon the supposed philanthropy of its rival, and it is likely to suffer in consequence. If Liberia does lose her northern territories, it is to be hoped that her statesmen will take to heart the lesson that from the day she declared her independence she was expected to have learned: that the era of philanthropy for her was over. She was to fight her own battles, look out for her own interests, stand up for her own rights. Failing to do this, she would suffer the consequences. Now in all the controversy about our North-west boundary we have blindly followed the path traced out by the English Government. We have done nothing that it was thought would offend. Their traders went into Mannah country. We enforced the laws they had ignored, were threatened with chastisement, paid an indemnity, saying we should protest, which we never formally did, and now we are told that we never protested—therefore it is an admission against us. Previous to the time of the Sulymah meeting, the English sent agents into the territory to collect evidence adverse to us, and paid for such evidence. We, although we had strong backers in the disputed territories, never made an effort to look after our interests and strengthen our case. Nor did we raise a single objection to the proceedings of the English Colonial Government. It might displease them; they would do right. Well, they have done right. They have cooked up a spurious claim made by a lot of exceedingly doubtful character, purporting to have been sworn in before magistrates influenced by traders known to be anxious for the acquisition of the country by Great Britain; and now they say, ""This is good claim; we must believe our citizens and our magistrates in preference to yours; give up the territory for the claim."" That the Cabinet was actually ready to fall in with the views of the English is heart-rending. Without animadversion, it certainly can be said with truth that they have disappointed the country. The protest transmitted by the citizens of Monrovia to the President truthfully points out the reason why we cannot accede without at least a struggle to the demands of the English Government. It would be but the beginning of the end.

Five hundred, perhaps, at the most. It lies far away from the routes pursued by tourists, and the busy world hears little and knows less of the independent negro State which nestles in a corner of the West African Coast and has been the scene of a series of experiments absolutely unique in history. It was from this part of the African coast that some attempt was to be made to develop the Dark Continent. Emancipated slaves from the United States, now citizens of a republic established by themselves in the land of their forefathers, were to be the torchbearers of civilisation and to carry the lamp of learning to their brethren in the interior. Such was the scheme of the large-hearted and liberal philanthropists who, early in the present century, founded the various colonisation societies in the United States with a view of enabling its negro population to found settlements on the West Coast of Africa. These settlements were gradually formed, and, after passing through a series of trials, eventually confederated. In 1822 the republic was declared, and in 1847 Liberia was recognised as an independent State by the sovereigns of Europe and the United States Government. From Washington the new State borrowed its constitution. Although she has enjoyed the advantage of having had at least three Presidents—E. Johnson, Russworm, and Roberts—of high character and executive ability, it would be untrue to say that the hopes of the founders of Liberia have been realised. On the contrary the Liberian Government seems to have entirely failed to win the confidence or even to gain the respect of the native kings and tribes within its supposed ""sphere of influence""; indeed, some of them resist all attempts to enforce authority within the ill-defined boundaries of the State. At the recent inauguration of the new President—the Hon. — Cheeseman—it was a matter of general satisfaction that a gunboat, ordered from a Keil dockyard, was on her way out from Germany. This boat is to be the foundation of the new Liberian Navy, and, strange to say, it is required, not for the defence of the State, but to coerce a British merchant who for three years has declined to pay customs duty on the ground that he receives no protection from Government, that there is no civilised administration in the district in which he resides, and that he is compelled to employ and pay a police force of his own. The Government, urged by German merchants to suppress their independent competitor, has signified its intention of resorting to force, and will probably find itself in a difficulty with our Foreign Office if a single shot is fired on an English factory whose owner is considered to have made out a good case for non-payment of duty. The attempts of Christian missionaries to evangelise the Western districts of Africa have been discouraging. From the year 1481, when some priests from Rome unsuccessfully endeavoured to withstand the climate, the history of Christian labour is one continuous narrative of a futile struggle against disease and death. Protestant societies in the United States have literally poured dollars by thousands into Liberia. Some good work is being done by white ministers who have formed thriving settlements up the country (where the land is fertile and the climate healthy), and have urged upon the natives the importance of cultivating rice, corn, potatoes, ginger, sugar, coffee, and arrowroot, all of which are remunerative crops. As for cotton, indigo, pepper, pineapples, and gumtrees, they grow wild, and the superior knowledge of the missionaries has enabled the natives to gather them profitably. But Christian workers have to reckon with a foe more stubborn than Paganism. Islam is gradually winning its way towards the West Coast from the interior. The sword, it is true, goes hand in hand with the green banner, but the African negro is a ready convert. He finds the precepts of the Prophet easy to understand, and the sanction of polygamy is in entire accord with his present practice. Moreover, where Mahomet gains ground, intemperance—which unhappily follows Christian missions—disappears. I have said that Liberia is fertile. It is certainly the richest district in West Africa, but it is terribly neglected, and can never thrive under its present administration. There is practically no Government. The rule of the negro is marked by selfishness and corruption. The colonisation societies in the United States have almost abandoned in despair sending out more emigrants who, on landing, finding themselves free from control, quickly become lazy and wholly useless as pioneers for opening up fresh country. It must be confessed, therefore, that, after a trial of seventy years, the American negroes have failed to erect a State worthy of the name. They have lost what little credit they had twenty years ago—not even the interest is paid on the loan of 500,000 dols. raised in London in 1870—and Liberia is gradually drifting into the hands of a few wide-awake German merchants, who are understood to have made advances to Government against valuable securities, as well as to have exerted sufficient influence in Berlin to induce General Caprivi to protest in vigorous language against the concession known as the ""indiarubber monopoly,"" granted by President Johnson to an English syndicate of company promoters under circumstances which have been severely criticised.

It is about 102 years old, thus considerably younger than the Gambia, which almost ranks with Newfoundland as being one of the very first British possessions abroad. Sierra Leone, however, has not much to show for its century of British rule. Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary. Here at present the great Mahommedan Chief Samadu is the actual ruler, and has created one of those African empires which are easily reared by successful robbers with extravagant bloodshed and widespread depredation. Samadu has several times fought the French on the Senegambian frontier, but of late he is said to have concluded peace with them. The productions of Sierra Leone are those of true Western Africa, and the colony is rich and well-favoured in vegetable wealth. It exports palm oil, palm kernels, rubber, gum, camwood, besides skins and benniseed and ground nuts.\n\nLiberia is British in language, and to a great extent in such culture as it possesses, although it enjoys an independent Government. But its native inhabitants, the Kru-boys, are under the delusion that they are British subjects ""of a sort,"" and do not admit any political connexion with the Americanised negroes who claim to govern them. On the east of Liberia, between the frontier and the west boundary of the French Gold Coast, is the Ivory Coast, about 100 miles in extent, and one of the last portions of the African coast, which remains unclaimed, unprotected, and unannexed by any European Power.

A. Rutherford, of the British & African Steam Navigation Company, arrived in the Mersey from West Africa on July 17. She brings news of a second battle between the Liberian forces and the natives of Rocktown, in which the latter were again victorious. The Volta left Rocktown on June 24, and the battle took place three days before. The Liberian troops numbered about 400, and the fight occupied the whole of the day. The Liberians retreated in the evening, and left the field in the possession of the natives of Rocktown. The battle really took place on the beach, between Cape Palmas and Rocktown. The Rocktown boys captured a brass cannon from the enemy and a white flag. It was difficult to get the precise figures as to the number of the killed, but it was believed that the Liberians lost about thirty killed, and the Rocktown boys about fifteen or twenty. The Rocktown boys turned the captured cannon on the Liberian gunboat, but the shots did not strike her. The gunboat nevertheless got out of the cannon's range. It seems that at one time the Liberians flew the white flag, but the Rocktown boys not understanding it fired into the ranks of the Liberians and continued the fight. Great excitement prevailed at Grand Bassa when the news of the defeat of the Liberians reached that place. The cause of the hostilities is that Liberia lays claim to Rocktown, and insists upon her laws and regulations being observed there. The Greeboes (the Rocktown natives) profess complete independence. The King of Rocktown asked Captain Rutherford to wait, as he was writing a letter to Queen Victoria telling her Majesty about the war. The Volta had about forty Rocktown boys as passengers, and most of them landed in their canoes, but before all of them could get away the Liberian man-of-war Gorronammah came up, and ordered her away, at the same time demanding that the Rocktown boys be given up to her. The boys on seeing the gunboat approach hid themselves in all parts of the ship, and Captain Rutherford declined to hand them over to the war vessel. The boys told Captain Rutherford that had he given them up they would have been killed.

They circulate such tales as the ‘annexation of Medina,’ and tell about ‘thousands of acres covered with gold and iron’ (probably meteoric deposits), and ask the public to invest. Poor widows and orphans, and others, are thus deluded into ‘Coffee Companies,’ &c., which die still-born, and the funds invested vanish. And then these people operate in Liberia, showing the people shortcuts to fortune, unsettling their ideas, absorbing their earnings, and preventing steady industry.

Bush is all that meets the eye, while not a sail is to be seen as far as the eye can reach. There are no towns of any size between Grand Bassa and Harper, but merely a few villages scattered at intervals along the coast. Harper is situated on Cape Palmas, and has a harbour immediately opposite, which is sufficiently commodious and affords ships cruising in this part of the world a pleasant change after the eternal surf of the West African shores. The town looks uncommonly well from the sea. The church spires peep out from amongst the trees, and the shingle-framed houses of the Liberians surrounded by gardens add picturesqueness to the scene. Harper possesses, besides old churches, an academy, a hospital, an orphan asylum, and a lighthouse. The latter is more of ornament than use, as the Republic cannot afford to keep it constantly lighted. Adjacent to the lighthouse is the flagstaff which bears the Liberian national flag, the same as the American ensign, with the exception that instead of many stars there is only one. The practically prohibitive taxation at present imposed by the Government will end in the withdrawal of all Europeans from the country, as it is now an impossibility to get at the interior of the country, and the amount of trade that can be indulged in at the open ports is not sufficiently remunerative in view of the heavy taxation imposed. At present the German traders are anxiously expecting the arrival of the German squadron from Europe, when they are hoping the Admiral in command will bring the requisite pressure to bear on the authorities to induce them to open out to them the interior of the country. The people here may be called prosperous; if they would not ape white men\'s ways, they would be all the better. Some are well educated, and quite *au fait* in the politics of the world, but they appear to have a great dislike to foreigners of any kind, and a wish to keep Liberia wholly and solely for the Liberians. It should be pointed out that the effect of present restrictions is to keep Liberia utterly impotent to enforce her authority within her territory, and to prevent her doing anything to advance the material condition of the country, and that if this policy be persisted in, the inevitable result would be that Liberia would be absorbed by a European Power. The Americans washed their hands of a Liberian protectorate years ago, and are not likely to embroil themselves with any Power over such a figment as ""Liberian independence."" The officials of the Republic are wretchedly paid. The Governor of Harper\'s income is only about £75 a-year; his house is furnished in the meanest style, and he appears to augment his salary by supplying ships with fresh provisions. The constitution of Liberia, as well as the institutions, the manners and customs of the people, and the language itself, appear to be modelled upon those of the United States. The pure Liberian guesses and calculates quite as much as do his white brothers in New York, and speaks with that nasal twang peculiar to the land of the stars and stripes. Manhood suffrage is one of the Liberian institutions, but this ""manhood suffrage"" involves the qualification of being possessed of real property to the extent of fifty dollars. Harper exports little but palm oil, and that little appears to be dwindling to still lower limits. The inhabitants appear to take a deep interest in politics, and elections and the state of parties seem to create as deep and universal interest here as in more civilized countries. A Liberian youth of sixteen or so being asked how often the President was elected, replied ""biennially,"" and proceeded to give an account of the political institutions of the country, which showed that the education of the Liberian youth is thorough, and embraces politics as well as more widely-taught subjects. The President of the Republic resides at Monrovia, the capital, where the Houses of Assembly sit. The salary attached to the Presidential office is only £400 a-year and a residence—not a very magnificent sum, but large enough in this country, where living is cheap, the expenses of life small. The solitary Englishman in Liberia is located at a place called Tabon, and is engaged in trading with the natives. He has for some time refused to pay the exorbitant taxes assessed upon him, and the Government has no force to compel him, with the result that many of the natives are inclined to follow his example. As the Government has no means of transport, they are unable to send any troops from Monrovia to Tabon, from which it is distant about 200 miles, and, probably, even if they could, they would hesitate to do so from fear of complications with the English Government, especially as the boundaries of Liberia are not at present clearly defined, and her Majesty\'s Government has declined to recognize any portion of the country to be Liberian territory when the Government of the country is not capable of enforcing its authority. The officials say that the President has invoked the assistance of the United States, and that an American ship is at present on its way to Tabon, to set matters right; but the Americans are much too cute to trouble themselves over such a paltry matter. A wide and deep river runs into the sea here, but it is ruined by a bar at its mouth, which prevents navigation. This matters little at the present time, but in the future, when Liberia has been annexed or roused from its present state of stagnation, means will probably be found to obviate this fatal impediment to navigation, both here and elsewhere, along the coast. A very few miles off, another large river—the Carallo—discharges itself into the sea, and is likely to become of great commercial importance in the future, as gold washings have been found on its banks. This river has been ascended for nearly 200 miles, and is stated to be navigable for that distance. This country is more valuable in every way than our Gold Coast Colony: it possesses three or four fairly good harbours, whereas the latter cannot boast of one. There is an absence of that terrible surf which makes landing or the transference of cargo almost impossible, and the country itself appears to be more productive, to have greater mineral wealth, and to ""tap"" a more valuable part of the Dark Continent. The estimated population of Liberia is about 767,000, only about 30,000 of whom are descendants of freed slaves from the United States, the remainder being the aborigines or ""heathen,"" as they are termed by the ""Liberians.""', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.712, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'FRANCE AND LIBERIA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Further, this treaty places Liberia almost in the position of a French protectorate.

We are kept down in this place next to servitude; our will is not our own; a few men who are in command of a little property keep us knuckle down to them. If we are in their employment we are seldom paid in money, but are obliged to take up such estables as they choose to give us. If a captain or supercargo comes, and wishes to give some of the enterprising young men of this place a little trust, these merchants here, though doing business on trust themselves, will oppose it, and advise the parties not to give them trust. If any of us try to do a little trading whereby we may progress, we are opposed, oppressed, and all kind of stratagems will be used to prevent our success. Hence we are living here not in harmony and love; every man is opposed to the progress of his neighbour in whatever pursuit he follows; whether it be in the mercantile line or farming, it seems as a dagger driven into us to see any one else prosper; very few sympathise with their fellow-citizen when misfortune happens to him, and fewer still will give any aid except for a large reward. Even the immigrants who are invited by us from America to come and help us to build up this black nationality, when they come out, except they possess a little money, are looked down upon with disdain and contempt by the other citizens; any advantages that can be taken of them will be taken. Sometimes we may be paid by the merchants when we are in their employment in Liberian currency, and if without leaving the store we give them back the currency for the purchase of some article in their store, they refuse to take the very currency they paid us, demanding specie of us; and if they do take it, it will be at a discount; and when foreigners come here to reside among us to do business, whether they be our colour or white men, whereby we can get articles cheaper, be employed, and the country built up for our benefit, the majority of people are against them, and they will try everything in their power to entrap them in law-suits; they will go to their places of business, abuse, insult, curse and swear at them, and some of our young men, when in the employment of foreigners, will skulk away a part of their time in idleness; and if their employers bring them up for it they will question their authority in doing so, and begin to speak of their freedom, and demand full pay for the time they have wasted in idleness; and if the foreigners refuse to pay them they are taken to law and made to pay, for our laws, Mr. Editor, are all one-sided. No foreigners or new-comers expect to get justice in Liberia; if they do, they will certainly drain the pockets well first. Whether this is done from the ignorance of the people, or whether they are influenced by the few merchants here, I cannot say; one thing I know, that this is a practice in the Republic, to take all advantage they can of foreigners, that they may be discouraged and leave the country. I am a supporter of foreigners, for without foreigners we cannot live. America receives into her country immigrants of all nations. The Dutchman finds a home and welcome; he brings with him skill and science, and puts them in operation. The Frenchman, the Englishman, the German, and Italian find welcome hands beckoning them to come; therefore America has advanced to what she is this day. Why can\'t Liberia stretch out her hands to all nations, and invite them into her country? Why can\'t Liberia open her ""Constitution,"" and allow all nations to come in and build her up? Why do Liberians take advantage of foreigners and strangers, and combine together against them? These are the things that keep us from progressing. Since our Government was a Government it has been in an embarrassed state; never was Liberia able to redeem her currency in gold and silver, as she reports.

The civilised population at this time numbered about 5,000, but Liberia's position as a State in Africa resembled that of its founders as individuals in America. It had no legal existence among the nations. This fact was made apparent by the refusal of foreign ships to pay the duties imposed by its Legislature. The natives of the coast continued to harass it in consequence of its opposition to the slave trade, until the new State found itself between an upper and a nether millstone. Governor Roberts applied himself to overcome each difficulty in turn. He succeeded in persuading the native chiefs to appreciate the advantages of civilisation, and a number were induced to federate for the purpose of abolishing slavery and introducing orderly administration within their borders. The federated body shortly afterwards entered the colony, and in 1845 the territory of the Kroomen was annexed by friendly treaty, thus adding a third county, under the name of Sinou, to the two which already existed. The colony now extended to Grand Sesters. Maryland also widened the area of her administration, and the entire coast was occupied from Cape Mount to San Pedro. The two colonies resolved to make a joint effort at self-assertion. They imposed an ad valorem customs duty of 6 per cent. upon foreign imports, but English merchants refused to admit the right of the Liberians to impose duties, and insisted upon trading freely as with a savage territory. An English ship was seized and detained by the Liberian authorities. It was rescued by force, and the English Government refused to recognise the Liberian Executive. Liberia had no position except as a dependency of the United States, and the prejudice against colour in America caused that Government to give only lukewarm support to the African colony. If it were to exist at all, it was necessary that it should assert its individuality and claim for itself the rights which were denied to it. Under these circumstances the American Colonisation Society came to the resolution to abandon all rights over its protégé and advised it to take its fate boldly into its own hands. A Republican constitution was drawn up, and on August 24, 1847, the existence of the Republic of Liberia was announced to the world."", 'last_edit_date': '1892-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1892#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Progress of Liberia', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Every true friend of Africa and its peoples must feel a deep interest in Liberia. The first independent civilized African State on the West Coast, she occupies a position of great honour and usefulness. With institutions framed on the model of those of the United States of America, she stands out boldly before the world asserting and proving that there is no lack of natural ability in the civilized African to work the machinery of free institutions. Her President, her judges, her learned professors, are Christian Africans; no white man holds any political position in the country; the nation is essentially negro, and is so far from feeling any need of European or American aid in carrying on the various departments of her government, that she does more than discourage, she prohibits the permanent settlement of white men within her borders. They may come there for purposes of trade, but they are not permitted to acquire landed property; African she is, and exclusively African she is determined to remain. The enemies and libellers of the African race not unfrequently point to Liberia with contempt and ridicule, because she has not obtained in infancy the development of manhood; because, having no capital but what has been created by the industry of her own people, she is not able to undertake those works of civilization which are so much needed for the rapid development of her great natural resources; because, amid the abundant elements of wealth existing in her rich tropical fertility, and with her capability of producing so many objects that Europe requires and is compelled to seek even at the opposite side of the world, her Government is poor, and her revenue insufficient, without constant patriotic self-denial on the part of her principal citizens, for the support of those establishments indispensable to a free Christian State, which includes within her borders a native heathen population more than twenty times exceeding in number the civilized population of which the State really consists. But so far from there being anything in her public condition to justify contempt and ridicule such as our ignorantly-learned anthropologists would heap upon her and her people, every impartial man will find cause in her for wonder and felicitation that a mere handful of people brought to the African Coast from the degrading servitude of the late Slave States of the great American Republic should have fallen into so few errors, and have made such rapid progress. For it must be especially borne in mind that no comparison between Liberia and an English colony would be fair. An English colony, however small the number of emigrants and their descendants may be, is constantly and from its very birth receiving assistance from realized British capital. But the African emigrants from the United States to Liberia have not had any such resources at their back. They or their fathers have been slaves; and their only means of reaching Liberia was by the gift of a free passage, with six months free support after arrival, by the Colonization Society which founded this refuge for emancipated slaves on the West Coast of Africa. There have been no African Crusoes to help to build up this African Republic; the wealth, whatever it may be, within her is only the surplus of what her own people have created, over and above what they required for their own support. The progress thus made must necessarily be slow in comparison with that of an English colony anywhere, although it may be, as it has been in reality, rapid when viewed only in connexion with the elements available for promoting it. But we hope and believe that the time is now approaching when that progress will be greatly stimulated. Liberia, formed of American Africans, strongly imbued with the Republican principles so extreme in the American people, is not likely to attract any new elements of wealth and population from any other country than that from which its present civilized population has been derived. Ardently desiring as we do to see a rapid advance in Liberia, we rejoiced when we foresaw, as an inevitable consequence of the civil war in the United States, an increased emigration of emancipated Africans from those states to Liberia. The extreme change in the position of the late slaves in America, who have been so suddenly elevated from a debasing bondage, from a condition in which they were estimated rather as beasts than as men, to the full privileges of citizenship, political as well as social, has, however, retarded that movement toward Africa which would otherwise have impelled large numbers of the emancipated to Liberia. Still, the desire to become citizens of an exclusively African Republic, and that in Africa, has been gradually spreading in America, and the Colonization Society, who sent a shipload of emigrants in November last, and another in May, will despatch their ship again in November next with a further addition of some 800 for the African Republic. From the published statements of the society we have reason to believe that 4,000 or 5,000 emigrants might have been sent to Liberia during the present year, instead of some 1,500, had the society been in possession of the requisite funds. We must express our hope that the Colonization Society will be able to obtain all the money it may require to realize the spontaneous desires of late American slaves to become Liberian citizens. It is only by a large increase in her civilized industrial population that Liberia can make rapid progress in production and wealth. She is limited to this source of increase by the elements of which she is composed, by the nature of her institutions, and the strong peculiarities of her people; and all who are desirous of seeing the West Coast countries and their peoples emerge from their barbarism and degradation and come within the sphere of Christian civilizing influences should assist the Colonization Society of the United States in conveying emigrants to Liberia. We had hoped that before 1870 her civilized population would there be increased to at least 50,000. She could with the assistance rendered by the society for six months after the arrival of the emigrants in Liberia have very well established the requisite number, or even a greater number, within her borders before that period could they have been sent to her; and such an addition to her civilized labourers on her coasts and the rich lands of her navigable rivers would, we are convinced, soon give to the carping libellers of the African race new and forcible evidence of the just claim of the African to the rights and sympathies of a common brotherhood with the hitherto more favoured European.', 'last_edit_date': '1867-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1867#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Great Britain was the first Power to hold out a helping hand, and a British man-of-war was sent to Monrovia to offer a salute of twenty-one guns to the new flag.

President Roberts, who undertook a tour through Europe for the purpose of obtaining the recognition of the Powers, was well received in England, and was not only able to conclude a commercial treaty, but was accepted as an ally in the prosecution of the campaign against the slave trade on the West African coast, and was presented with a gunboat to enable him to carry on the repression of the traffic in Liberian waters. He, in 1849, took an active part in an expedition of the Powers against the slade traders, who had their headquarters in the northern territory lying between Liberia and Sierra Leone. It was felt that if the whole coast could be held under anti-slavery supervision the trade might be extirpated, and in 1850 the West Coast territory to Cape Turner was purchased from the owners and placed under the guardianship of Liberia. Robertsport was founded this year, and commemorates the name of the President. The population of the Republic was rapidly increasing, her territory was extended towards the interior by treaties with the chiefs, and in 1857 the colony of Maryland was by its own request annexed.

The General History of Africa textbook provides a rich tapestry of such dynamics, highlighting numerous instances of succession disputes and the use of executions to consolidate power, as seen in regions like Benin City and Duke Town, and among leaders like Oba Ovonranwen. It also discusses the complex political dynamics in the Mossi lands and the Asante kingdom, where internal strife and external pressures influenced governance. However, the textbook does not specifically mention King Darko Yaw or his execution, suggesting that while the broader themes are well-documented, his particular case is not covered. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide specific details about King Darko Yaw's execution by his own chiefs after his secret negotiations with the Ashantee King, Quacoe Duah, were discovered.

It also discusses the complex political dynamics and leadership disputes in regions like the Mossi lands and the Asante kingdom, where internal strife and external pressures influenced governance. However, the textbook does not specifically mention King Darko Yaw or his execution, nor does it provide details about secret negotiations with the Ashantee King. This absence of specific information about King Darko Yaw is a notable difference, suggesting that while the broader themes of leadership disputes and accountability are well-documented, the particular case of King Darko Yaw is not covered in the provided excerpts.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim regarding the execution of King Darko Yaw and the broader context of internal conflicts and political dynamics within African kingdoms during the 19th century. The articles describe how Darko Yaw was executed by his own chiefs after his secret negotiations with the Ashantee King, Quacoe Duah, were discovered. This incident highlights the internal power struggles and the accountability mechanisms within the Aquamboe kingdom, as the chiefs acted decisively to prevent a perceived betrayal. Additionally, the articles mention other instances of leadership disputes and political intrigue, such as the conflict between the King of Duke Town and Adiabo, and the power struggles involving the Ashantee and D'Juabin kingdoms.

Brutal massacres and secessionist movements were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority, such as the Tondyon of Segu and the ministers of the court of Wagadugu.

The Eyo lineage achieved an early dominance in Creek Town that it maintained for the rest of the century. The rival lineage of Akabom migrated to found the settlement of Cobham Town. The position was different in Duke Town. When Duke Ephraim died in 1834, he was succeeded, not by his son or a member of his lineage, but by Eyamba V, that is, the fifth holder of the eyamba title of the Ekpe society. At the death of Eyamba V in 1847, there was a dispute between the lineages of Eyamba and Duke Ephraim. The British set up a third candidate, Archibong I. At the death of Archibong I in 1852, the traders and the consul recognized Ephraim Duke. Thenceforward, disputes arose between the Duke, Eyamba, and Archibong lineages.

In dispensing justice, he was accessible to noble and commoner alike. It is highly likely that this social policy was a factor in the great rebellion of the princes that broke out in his reign at the instigation of the most important of his ministers, the Widi Naaba.\nLastly, we may mention the coastal lands, where the driving forces of trade and education were producing a qualitatively new type of social stratification. Once the basis of commercial activity had shifted from the slave trade to the exchange of palm oil, rubber, ivory and gold for European products, a new merchant class emerged, operating with stocks of trade goods advanced by European companies, whose agents they actually were. Thus began the careers of a number of great merchants with establishments in the coastal centres. At a lower level, swarms of petty dealers who played the role of door-to-door salesmen to the suppliers gravitated around the great merchants, on whom they were dependent.$^{62}$ The Asante merchants who, for their part, controlled the supply of products from the interior of Africa, namely the akonkofo, also constituted a factor to be reckoned with. 63 In much the same way, in the field of education new categories, or even entire social classes, came into being along the coast. At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone. These people were regarded as 'English gentlemen', and behaved accordingly. They were accepted in European circles and rose to positions of responsibility as magistrates, commanders of forts and the like.

There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The collapse of Old Oyó', 'content': ""Although independence from Oyo had been the policy of all Dahomey monarchs, beginning with Kpengla (1774-89), it was not until the opening years of the reign of Gezo (1818-58) that the Oyo imperial yoke was repudiated.

The European anti-slave trade movement hit the state's economy, based as it was almost solely on the slave trade.

Those African rulers who have been mistakenly termed collaborators were those who thought that the best way of safeguarding their sovereignty or even regaining the sovereignty that they might have lost to some African power previous to the arrival of the Europeans was not to collaborate but rather to ally with the European invaders. A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation.

But the last straw that really precipitated action was the demand of the British governor, Arnold Hodgson, for the Golden Stool to be sent to him so that he could sit on it. The Golden Stool was the most sacred object of the Asante, which they considered as the embodiment of their soul and a symbol of their survival as a nation. That demand, therefore, could not but touch off an instantaneous rebellion of nearly all the principal states under the leadership of the Queen of Edweso, Nana Yaa Asantewaa (see Plate 6.2). 64 The Asante forces attacked the Governor and his party who had to seek refuge in the fort at Kumasi which the Asante then besieged.

It is interesting to note that the action of the asafo was precipi› tated by the decision of the Akyem Abuakwa State Council to approve the Native Administration Revenue measure proposed by the Colonial administration which was to give the council power to impose a levy on its subjects. As Simensen has shown, the list of charges preferred against the Omanhene show 'an increased awareness of the commoners that many of their troubles arose from the fact that the chiefs were being integrated into the administrative structure of the Colonial Government, and thereby removed from popular control'.$^{20}$ Thus the action of the asafo was directed as much against the colonial administration as it was against the traditional rulers.

There were similar rural activities in such areas as Akyem Abuakwa, Akuapem and Akyem Swedru."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': ""Because of their exclusion, the new elites went into open opposition against the colonial powers. In this open opposition the traditional rulers could not join them. Their continued survival depended on the colonial power and this tied their hands. Also for the most part the traditional rulers were not sufficiently educated to participate meaningfully in the highfaluting debates of the new elites. In any case if they accepted the arguments of the new elites, they would be consigning themselves to second or even third place. Because they did not side with the new elites, the latter regarded them as the lackeys of imperialism. They in turn regarded the new elites as revolutionaries who wanted to destroy im› memorial custom and turn the world upside down.\nTo make matters worse the two were driven by imperialist propaganda into engaging in a struggle over who spoke for the people. The new elites said they did. This the traditional rulers denied, claiming the honour for themselves. The colonial administration agreed with them. The kind of acrimony which this disagreement at times generated could be seen in the dispute between the chief of Akyem-Abuakwa in the Gold Coast, Nana Sir Ofori Atta and the leaders of the National Congress of British West Africa in the 1920s. It could also be seen in the same period in the quarrel between Harry Thuku's Young Kikuyu Association on the one hand, and the Kikuyu Association dominated by the traditional rulers on the other. 7\nYet one cannot conclude from the foregoing that in the period 1880 to 1935 the normal relationship between the new elites and the traditional rulers was invariably one of conflict. The nature of the relationship varied both in place and time. In the French territories neither the new elites nor the traditional rulers flourished under alien rule. And when after the Second World War the stranglehold of colonial autocracy came to be progressively relaxed, those who emerged as the leaders of French African nationalism included traditional rulers and their descendants."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'Politics and nationalism in British West Africa > Rural politics or rural mass nationalism in the inter-war period', 'content': ""In this document, fees and fines being imposed by the traditional rulers were reduced and regulations for their imposition were laid down; the Okwahuman Council was also to be made a truly representative body of chiefs and commoners and failure to attend was to be made punishable by fine.

Trade in foodstuffs was to be centralized in certain towns, a detailed list of market prices and trade fees was to be drawn up, the export of fish and game from Kwahu was prohibited and rules governing marriages, family responsibilities in debt cases, funerals, adultery by chiefs, etc., were laid down. As J. Simensen has concluded, 'this Charter is probably the most detailed documentation that we have from the early period of colonial rule in the Gold Coast of an attempt by commoners to curtail the authority of the traditional elite and assert their own influence more effectively in the fields of jurisdiction and legislation.' 19 The second method adopted by the commoners of the rural areas was the destoolment (deposition) of their traditional rulers, and this became quite a common feature of rural politics in the Gold Coast in the inter-war period. Between 1910 and 1944, there were at least thirty-three depositions of divisional chiefs in Akyem Abuakwa alone.

The few exceptions included, notably, General (later Marshal) Lyautey in Morocco, Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard in Northern Nigeria and Sir Gordon Guggisberg in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators. There is among the whole of this badly payed and very wretched elite - as remote from indigenous society, from which it has been driven out, as it is from European society into which it is not admitted - a feeling of disillusionment, discontent and bitterness which it would prove dangerous to be unaware of. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Cameroon coast and its hinterland 14', 'content': ""British interest in the abolition of the slave trade and the establishment of legitimate trade led to treaties and the gradual loss of the sovereignty of the local rulers. Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858. But local opposition to the Baptists continued to be high, especially as many of the Anglo-West Indian settlers at Victoria also traded in competition with the Bimbia population."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 340, 'article_title': 'CAPE COAST.', 'full_section_title': 'CAPE COAST.', 'last_edit_date': '04-11-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1864#article-5', 'issue_date': '23_05_1864', 'content': '## GOLD COAST.  \nTO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.  \nKpong, Kroboe, April 10, 1864.\n\nSir,—On the 24th ult.

Partly, perhaps, because the Ashantee arrangements with the King of Aquamoo (whose execution by his own chiefs and people is described in a letter we publish to-day) had not been completed; but chiefly, we have no hesitation in affirming, because of the threatened invasion of Ashantee itself—the opening a route (for it does not deserve the name of a road) to the frontier at Prahssoo—the formation of an encampment there, with a battery to guard the fords of the river, and eventually cover the passage of the troops, and the advance of those 500 disciplined troops to the Prah. The sacrifice of health, life, and money there has not, therefore, as alleged, been utterly useless. Far from it. A moderate estimate of the loss of native life within the Protected Territories last year, immediate and contingent on the Ashantee ravages, places it at 10,000 human beings. From the greater completeness of the Ashantee preparations, there can be little doubt that the loss of life this year, had they again made an unopposed invasion, would have been still greater. Is it worth nothing to have prevented this? The disappointment is great at Cape Coast that Coomassie has not yet fallen into our hands, and we have thought it our duty to give expression to that feeling. But to us it seems that the Government at home should either not have sanctioned the projected invasion of Ashantee, or should have taken care that the reinforcements indispensable for such an invasion should have arrived in proper time.

His Majesty, it may be remembered, signed the other day a treaty with the Court of Berlin, by which eight rivers and the territory which they water were placed under the German flag. This convention, however, did not please the people; so what did they do? They whipped their King. The poor Sovereign, because he had granted Prince Bismarck the right to establish colonies in the Cameroons, was actually flogged by his subjects. Now, even in the most Constitutional Monarchy, this measure must be considered an extreme step. Boxing a King\'s ears in order to correct his foreign policy is in its way a novelty; for, though no doubt there have been many titular Monarchs who have been governed by their Queen Consorts—and, if the truth were told, have had their faces slapped by them—this is probably the first time that a reigning Sovereign has been flogged for exercising what he was pleased to consider his prerogatives. It has been said that \'divinity does hedge a king\'; but in Liberia the fence would appear to be somewhat defective, and the \'right divine to govern wrong\' to be tempered with an occasional application of cudgels. Of course a great deal may be excused in officials and functionaries who draw their salary at irregular intervals, in cocoa-nuts or birds\'-skins; but it seems an unnecessary high-handed procedure when the chiefs of the Cameroons, simply because they disapprove of German annexation, go and thump their King. Large questions of foreign policy should admit, so it seems to us, of more regular methods of settlement, and even Liberia might devise some more becoming mode of condemning Teutonic colonisation than whipping their Sovereign.

King Mensah has ordered a division of his troops to invade Djuabin; the detachment has entered Assafoo-agay\'s territory. The King of Djuabin, not to be backward, has directed one of his chiefs to ascertain whether in reality his territory has been invaded; if so, to inform him thereof; but on no account to fire on the enemy. This does not appear to have been long left in doubt, for the advance-guard of King Mensah\'s force was found in possession of a Djuabin village, the people of which had been induced to join the opposite ranks. Assafoo-agay\'s men were fired upon, and one of them shot; they did not return the fire, but attempted to capture some of the Kumasi men, but were not successful. Since then, we learn, that Assafoo-agay has sent to Mensah to complain of this, but instead of obtaining redress, his messengers were treated with contumely. This conduct has led the King of Djuabin to send down messengers to Governor Strahan to acquaint him with all that has occurred, and to inform the Government that if the peace be broken it will not have been brought about by him.\n\n""Information has reached us also that the Gamans, and other former tributaries of Ashanti, inland, have sent to Assafoo-agay to make common cause with them against the Kumasi people, as they are determined to completely break up the power of the King of Ashanti; and if the Djuabins will not join them in the enterprise, they will take the field against Assafoo-agay and the King of Ashanti as their common foes.\n\n""It is rumoured that the Akims will join the Djuabins if Assafoo-agay resolves on fighting; and from all we can learn, fight he will, unless Governor Strahan directs otherwise.\n\n""The interior tributaries of Ashanti are longing to reach the sea-coast; they wish to destroy the power of Ashanti, so that they may be able to come down here to trade in peace, and the road into the interior be opened to commercial enterprise.

In Old Calabar it is preferred that the country should be governed by Her Majesty\'s rules and regulations, and no other. The principal chief who is subverting the people and country, and setting uproar among the inhabitants, is this Prince Duke. A young gentleman from Fernandopo arrived here by the last mail steamer, and took a lodging in his premises. One day in their conversation, he said to the gentleman that the Treaty can be easily dishonoured, seeing it was forced upon them. The reply from the stranger was: ""Prince, do not play with Her Majesty\'s covenant made by her representative; you were not forced into it at all; the agreement is written in both English and your native tongue, and was read in your presence, and was to your satisfaction."" Again, some time previously, he asked a man if he thought he was able to send away the missionaries from his country. To this he got no reply. This Prince Duke, who desires to be king, wishes not for missionaries to dwell among them, fearing the peoples\' eyes will be opened and they be turned from their heathen practices and barbarous deeds, such as the cutting off of human ears, and other cruel treatment.

This would-be king takes upon himself to oppress the country and poor slaves. Are not these slaves human beings? But in Calabar they are subject to greater cruelty than are the brutes. Orok, the would-be king, is full of intrigues. In the latter part of September, this year, he sent that superstitious Egbo to a poor man named Anquai to molest his property, and seized forty-one persons, including men and women, belonging to this Anquai, to be his slaves, and wished to retain them as his own property; and these men and women so seized were forced to take the country oath and become his slaves.

Two instances of great devotion were displayed by two of the late king's wives; they followed the procession to the grave, and as their lord the king was placed in his sepulchre, they drank bowls of poison and threw themselves alongside of him. The rest of his wives were decapitated by force. The prince informs me that the stench in Kumasi was dreadful, and he was glad to get away from the horrors that surrounded him.

There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority.

Brutal massacres and secessionist move› ments were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority...

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.59, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Political structures', 'content': ""Khedive Ismail revived and advanced this spirit of reform, employing Europeans to supervise abolitionist and commercial ventures in the Sudan, completing the cutting of the Suez Canal and constructing other canals and irrigation works, railways, communication systems and the like.

There has been so little of a satisfactory nature to record during the past twelve months, that the more brief our notice of them the better. The close of the great war in Eastern Europe has not brought with it that recovery of buoyant prosperity so eagerly expected, and which would not have failed to benefit the West Coast of Africa, in common with other colonies and settlements of the British Crown. When the national pulse beats healthily in London, Liverpool, Manchester, and Glasgow, the rebound is felt in the remotest corners of the Empire. When there is depression and feebleness in the mother country, it were vain to expect vigour in the dependencies. This depression and feebleness have characterized the year 1878. Peace to its ashes! Ere this number of the African Times reaches the furthest removed of our readers on the West Coast of Africa, Christmas, with all its joyous, heart-stirring reminiscences, its holy, soul-entrancing associations, will have become an event of the past; and the New Year—a year, like all its predecessors, of course one of promise to many minds—will have exhibited its first day of glories in their intertropical skies. We offer to these, and to all, our congratulations and our best wishes. Much, both as regards them and us, of the results of EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-NINE will depend upon the feelings and resolves with which we enter upon this new circle of human existence. If our feelings and resolves with regard to HIM from whom cometh every good thing, every good and perfect gift, be such as gratitude to our Maker and Redeemer, and love to our fellow-men, ought to give birth to, and be joined with a humble reliance on His help, and faith and trust in Him, there will be found an inestimable pearl in the cup, even though the contents we shall have had to drink may have been bitter on the palate of our human affections and our bodily and social wants. Let us all begin with a firm resolve to do with all our power all that is good—to resist with all our power the temptation to, and performance of, all that is evil; and when we see again in our soul\'s retrospective historical reverie the ""Star"" standing for us ""over the spot where the young child lay,"" we shall find that Eighteen Hundred and Seventy-nine has not passed away from us without leaving us a blessing. We hope there will be progress in the right direction—moral, social, material, and religious—in every district of native Africa, and more especially in those of the West Coast in which are the homes of so many of our friends and readers. May the good be strengthened and perfected in good, the evil-minded be made good, the fraudulent be made honest, the unjust just; and brotherly kindness take the place of that bitter personal strife which unhappily has too much prevailed! So far as our editorial power may extend, it will be, as hitherto, employed for the correction and removal of abuses, the remedying of wrongs, the furtherance of material progress and development, and of that Christian civilization the foundations of which have been already laid in the British West Coast settlements!

The evil practices of the mere verbal moralist do not annul the holy precepts that may fall from his lips; but they do impair, if not destroy, their efficacy even among those who may have had the inestimable advantages of religious and moral training. And if this be the case where there ought to be sufficient mental enlightenment to enable the hearer and beholder to separate between the precept and the man whose office or position makes it a part of his duty to promulgate it, even when daily transgressing its commands, how much more injuriously must it obtain among the poor ignorant, uneducated, and unenlightened people of Africa, who, if they reason at all, can only reason from the facts that are brought under their notice. One of the first things that forced itself upon us when we commenced our public labours for Africa, was the mightily pernicious influence on the African mind and conduct of the evil examples set by Europeans exercising authority on the West Coast. We shall not recapitulate charges which from time to time it has been our painful duty to make against officials, and which have been always most reluctantly made by us. Thank God there has been a gradual improvement in these matters; but there is yet much to condemn. Our officials do not yet seem to have quite got rid of the old feeling among their class, that in taking service in Africa they were freed at once from all those religious and moral restraints to which they were more or less subject in Great Britain and Ireland; and that they may do with impunity all such things as may be done by irresponsible traders frequenting the Coast in the legitimate search for gain, and who are only answerable to their own consciences as before God. British officials represent the British nation and its Sovereign, and ought to represent also the precepts of the Christian religion which these profess. The declared policy which they have to carry out or help to forward, is one of the Christian enlightenment of the natives, and their preparation for the responsible duties of self-government as members of dependent or independent African communities; and whatever may have been previously the case, they are now amenable to public opinion in England and Africa as represented by the African Times.

There is much to discourage us in our work for Africa and its people. It is so difficult to make those who, for themselves and their posterity, are most interested in the results we may achieve comprehend how hard the task of social and administrative reformation is; and that it is their and our duty to persevere in efforts to obtain and secure it, in spite of all the obstacles that vice and egotism, long enthroned evils in West Africa, may marshal against us. Vicious authority is rampant, insolent, and seductive, and its scoffs and sneers and bribes are not without effect among the victims at whose expense it exists, thrives, and debauches; and it is not difficult for it to induce many of them to range themselves on its side, and against those the best part of whose lives is being consumed in constant and unrewarded exertions to procure for them those changes which are indispensable to their social and national progress. Occasionally our path is cheered by some enthusiastic testimony to the good we are effecting; but for the most part we have to complain of a seeming apathetic indifference, which greatly dishonours those who evince it. We are entitled, after eleven years of unrequited labour, to say, that it is a flagrant disgrace to every African who can read and does not subscribe to this paper and pay for it. Men ought to feel ashamed to borrow it of their neighbours when they can themselves procure it by paying the modest sum of five shillings a-year for it. The letters which appear in this present number show the urgent necessity of administrative reforms as a means of obtaining what is of vital importance; these reforms must be forced upon the Government, Imperial and Local, as they will never be spontaneously accorded; and the only way in which they can be thus forced is by the publicity given to the evidences of need of them, in the columns of the African Times. There are doubtless some of the most intelligent of the educated Africans in every settlement who fully comprehend all this—and to them we say, they do not perform their duty by merely subscribing to and reading our paper; they ought to form themselves everywhere into committees for furthering subscriptions to it.

If we have checked some evils, prepared the way for the removal of others, and effected some real good, we regard these results as merely the first stones in our structure of African improvement. We receive from so many quarters in Africa the gratifying assurances that this journal is exercising great power for good, that we now claim from the friends of Africa, as a right, that support which we first solicited, in hope that we might possibly advance by our labours the great cause of the industrial regeneration of Africa. It is not too much to say that we have prepared the way for those commercial companies which are now coming full of promise into the great field of undeveloped African commerce. We have given Africa a voice among influential people in Great Britain. We have made her cries for help, that she can and will so richly repay, heard by those who have the power and the knowledge that are needed for successful efforts in her great fields of produce.

With the white man's knowledge came also the white man's sins; and as with individuals men will be found to imitate the bad example rather than the good, so has it been with Africa in general, since only in the parts as yet unvisited by the white man is the black man found in his native simplicity and ignorance; whilst in all other parts he has acquired cunning, deceit, and mistrust.\n\nThe means originally adopted for the improvement (if improvement it could be called) of newly-discovered Africa had presently and ultimately in view gain. The possessions of the black man were coveted and craftily obtained; the black man's body even was made the subject of barter and exchange, with the object of his working for the white man's use, as cattle bought in market overt. No wonder, then, that the influence of the white man over the black was evil instead of good; and the improvement of Africa had subsequently to be effected through the removal of that mistrust and deceit which the white man's conduct had produced. Trade can be legitimate as well as beneficial. Had this been practically shown in Africa, who can calculate the enormous benefit which the white man's influence in Africa would, ere this, have brought. Some men's sins go before to judgment, and some they follow after. Transgressors go not without the punishment due to their offence, but those who follow them have the effect of their transgressions to overcome, ere they can be placed in the position they occupied before such offence was committed. Other means were doubtlessly adopted, and ultimately Christianity was brought to bear only where all these means had failed. No wonder, then, that religion was, to the black man, invested with the garment of a trade, and this investment proved against the white man, in return, the greatest hindrance to progress and improvement."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1864#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.586, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Mission Work at the Cameroons', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I might go to a far greater length, but I fear I have already trespassed too far upon your column.

1403,Pre-colonial Africa exhibited a complex and decentralized political structure characterized by multiple independent chiefs and hierarchical social systems.,"The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that pre-colonial Africa exhibited a complex and decentralized political structure characterized by multiple independent chiefs and hierarchical social systems. The General History of Africa provides detailed accounts of various political models, including non-centralized societies with integrative institutions in religious, judicial, and economic fields, capable of functioning independently or replacing disintegrating state systems. It highlights segmentary lineage systems among nomadic peoples, where political organization was based on kinship and genealogy rather than centralized authority, and describes hierarchical social structures in Saharan societies dominated by aristocratic warrior lineages. The text also notes the autonomy of subordinate states within larger empires and the role of chiefs in colonial administration, underscoring the complexity and multiplicity of independent chiefs in pre-colonial political systems. Complementing this, The African Times articles mention numerous chiefs and kings, such as King Cudjoe Edjue, Chief Arkonkoo, and King Tackie, across various regions, illustrating a decentralized political landscape. The articles further describe the Bantu tribes in the Congo district, each with their own petty chiefs, and highlight hierarchical social systems through the roles of head-men and the organization of societies with distinct roles for men and women. While the articles do not delve deeply into hierarchical social systems beyond the roles of chiefs and head-men, they still align with the claim by depicting a pre-colonial Africa with a complex and decentralized political structure. Together, these sources paint a picture of a diverse and intricate political landscape in pre-colonial Africa, characterized by both decentralized and hierarchical elements.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that support the claim that pre-colonial Africa exhibited a complex and decentralized political structure characterized by multiple independent chiefs and hierarchical social systems.

Cutting across the lineage system of non-centralized societies, a variety of integrative institutions developed in the religious, judicial and economic fields which could function as an overall framework of order or replace a disintegrating state-system.$^{25}$ The poro and similar associations in Upper Guinea, or various so-called 'secret societies' in the Cross river and equatorial forest areas of the Cameroons and Gabon are examples. In the case of the Aro, it was the widespread influence of a set of oracles, managed through a network of Aro colonies and local 'secret societies', that provided a judicial and economic basis of integration over a wide section of Igboland.

In Bunafu, not only was there a sense of government and authority, some of the migrants came with traditions of structured hierarchical political systems from which they were fleeing, but which they still drew upon in the rivalries that accompanied the emergence of a new authority system in Bunafu. Others also carried with them belief in the power of a the mukama, a charismatic prince chosen and possessed by the god, or the efficacy of ritual firelighting from royal hearths, to affect fertility and harvests. As Vellut has argued, instead of the state-stateless dichotomy, we should think of two modes of power structures: the hierarchical, well-defined order based on the payment of tribute which was that of the kingdoms; and, at the other extreme, the more egalitarian and informal type of government by councils of elders and notables."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Mfecane and the rise of new African states', 'section_title': 'The structure of northern Nguni society', 'content': ""and clans.

These societies, which have been described in the anthropological literature as segmentary lineage systems, place each person in a series of widening and overlapping descent groups that are larger the more distant an ancestor is chosen as a point of reference. 4 Genealogy can be used to divide a society into x number of maximal segments, each of which is in turn divided into y number of segments and z number of clans, on down through intermediate levels to the extended family. Societies organized according to descent may resolve internal con› flict without recourse to central authority if the power of segments at an appropriate level in the genealogical structure is in balance, and the history of these societies often exhibits this mechanism in operation. But history also demonstrates that segments may unite to face an outside threat, and that military exigency may even give rise to something resembling central authority. Sedentary or semi-sedentary people have often assimilated nonkin who migrated to their territory, and in these societies residence in the same territory may replace kinship as a principle of association. Even societies that are organized according to descent may have leaders or councils at various levels in the segmentary structure or distributed throughout it; wealthy men may attract followers who are not kin; or alliances may contradict or partially offset the notion of kinship as a determinant of allegiance.\nAnother similarity among Saharan people was hierarchical social struc- ture, a consequence of the power of warriors to concentrate wealth so as to reinforce their own position of dominance. A common pattern was that lineages of aristocratic warriors controlled groups of free but politically subordinate people, the descendants of conquered nomads. People of lower status, slaves or the descendants of slaves, worked as servants, herders, artisans, trade specialists, or farmers.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate and Borno', 'section_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80 > The emirates: political structure', 'content': ""In the case of Katsina, the original, rather limited lineage-based cen› tralization gave way, in the face of militarism, to an increasingly autocratic palace government. These changes occurred without civil strife, in part because there had always been considerable autonomy in outlying districts, the growing prosperity of which made office at the capital less important.\nSo far only the upper levels of the administrative system have been discussed. Administration at the 'grass roots' was more uniform (and similar to that found elsewhere in West Africa). The smallest units, households or camps, were grouped into larger units, defined by a territory or by kinship. Generally pastoralists, Tuareg or Fulbe, were more organized through links of kinship than were agriculturalists, and in consequence retained their own ardo'en or tambura as leaders. Their cohesion gave them a political strength that the more fragmented agriculturalists did not have, but this superior strength relative to the rest of the population did not last into the second half of the century.\nIn larger, long-settled towns and villages ward representatives could be co-ordinated by one of their number, known as the mai gari, magaji, dagaci or mukoshi. The links between these representatives of the local population and the upper levels of the administration were in the hands ofjakadu, servants or agents of the office-holder allocated the responsibility for that section of the population. Similarly, messengers linked the office-holder to his amir. The function of the administration was primarily tax collection, but this was as much a political as an economic act; to pay was also a symbolic act of submission, to refuse payment was a token of rebellion. As a necessary part of tax collection, the administration gathered political information, ratified appointments; collected shares of inheritance, took charge of and dispatched the property of strangers who died en route; organized the arrest of a criminal or a runaway slave, forwarded defendants in civil cases, arranged the release of someone wrongfully detained or someone to be ransomed; took intractable cases for mediation by the office› holder or themselves answered charges of oppression by complainants at the amir's personal court; and in time of war organized the recruitment of people for campaigns.

The grand lesson of the slave trade era long driven home in West and Central Africa, and being learnt in East Africa in the course of the nineteenth century, was that the way to survive and perhaps even profit from the slave trade was to strengthen the structures and military basis of state power.\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, as we have noted in most parts of Africa, 'the political and economic structures ... seemed to have a certain fragility about them. There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority. In the words of K. Arhin and J. Ki-Zerbo describing the Voltaic regions: During the nineteenth century, political instability and population movements were widespread. Brutal massacres and secessionist move› ments were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority... Some notable exceptions notwithstanding, the frequency and extent of these conflicts grew and the tendency towards social dislocation was undoubtedly linked with the growing opportunities available to the peripheral powers and the rebels to obtain arms and use them to challenge the reigning chiefs. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia on the eve of the Scramble for Africa Liberia > Ethiopia', 'content': ""and 'symbolic'.

More importantly perhaps, the emperor symbolized national unity and independence by virtue of his alleged descent from the Biblical King Solomon and his coronation and anointment by the abuna, the Egyptian head of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. 1 7 The imperial system inherited by Tewodros lacked a notable 'historic bureaucracy'.$^{18}$ Excepting comparatively few offices with well-defined functions like the Tsahafe Tezaz (Imperial Secretary) and the Afa-Negus (Chief Justice), the imperial administration was largely personalized in the emperor and his regional representatives: the governors and lords. 19 Tewodros himself attempted to create a bureaucracy by often replacing existing governors of aristocratic stock by paid army generals of humble birth, loyal to, and dependent on him. But the new governors were overthrown and replaced by pre-existing dynasties during widespread revolts against his increasingly harsh rule. 20 The similarities between Liberia's and Ethiopia's political systems were too obvious from the analysis thus far to belabour. Besides possessing a core and periphery, and a central government, each had sub-political systems centred on local chiefdoms (or villages) like those of the Gola in Liberia or the Oromo ('Galla') in Ethiopia not discussed in this chapter, with political cultures more or less different from the dominant political culture at the centre. Both systems were solidly based on privilege at the core, and extensively utilized patronage and assimilation techniques. Nevertheless, whereas Ethiopia's imperial system was largely 'African', lacking political parties or parliament - Tewodros, Yohannes and Menelik became Emperor by virtue of their superior military power over their rivals, and not through the ballot box - Liberia's central government was thoroughly western.

The search for more stable political structures had been going on throughout the nineteenth century and indeed before then as part of the general evolution of the peoples.

The great Asante kingdom then comprised three types of territorial unit.\nFirst, there was the central group of Asante chiefdoms, long united under the authority of the Asantehene by the same language, geographical contiguity, a vast network of family ties and affinities, a century of common military activities and pride in their spectacular achievements. In addition, and fundamentally, there was the mystical bond of belief in the protecting power of the Golden Stool of the Asante and the spirits of the Asantehene's ancestors.$^{11}$ Membership in the union took the following tangible forms: participation by chiefs of member states in the enthronement of the head of state of Kumasi, the Asante sovereign, and the swearing of an oath of allegiance to him; attendance at the general assembly (nhyiamu) of chiefs at which major political matters (such as war, peace and treaties) were discussed, and acceptance of the great Asante oath as the supreme instru› ment of justice for all of the Asantehene's territories. 12 These integrative institutions constituted the fundamental bases of the state machinery. They were to be found in all the Akan states as well as in Asante, which meant that the idea of the legitimacy of power through conquest had replaced that of political identity established through kinship and religion.

Few were allowed, like Benin, to merely contract and survive.$^{7}$ Most, like, for example, Asante, Dahomey and Buganda, had constantly to maintain and even improve on their efficiency largely in terms of the ability of the ruler to centralize power, weaken subordinates, extract more and more surpluses from them; monopolize major economic and stragetic resources; institutionalize a hierarchy of officials dependent on the ruler for appointment, advancement and discipline; and sustain these powers by the establishment and control of a standing military force, commanded by officials similarly dependent on the ruler. This veritable revolution was sometimes achieved without an obvious change of political system; sometimes, as in the case of Borno, it necessitated a change of dynasty.$^{8}$ Often there was a compromise as 'new men' were appointed to old chieftaincies and made to function in new bureaucratic ways, or new offices came to acquire something of the ethos of older traditional titles."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Political structures', 'content': 'The Mfecane spread far and wide a new model of the northern Nguni state as revolutionized by Shaka.

But there is no doubt that for all the initial devastation and confusion created, the Mfecane succeeded in establishing several larger, more efficient and stronger states, with more durable structures than had existed previously. The new states also had more-clearly defined frontiers, if only because they made such demands on the ruled that there could be little doubt about the extent or limits of jurisdiction.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

These included the creation of chancelleries to be managed by literate Africans to control diplomatic relations with Europeans and guide the external relations of the states; the reform of tax systems by the introduction of regulated taxes in place of tolls and tribute; and the improvement of the judicial system by the introduction of record-keeping and putting enacted laws into writing. 15"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': ""If the more abiding claims of ethnic integrity were not always respected, neither were the more ephemeral claims of conquest states and empires to territorial integrity.

Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern.

The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""With the establishment of European administration, chiefs were manipulated as if they were administrative personnel who might be reposted or removed to satisfy colonial needs. Chieftaincies were abolished where considered superfluous and created where considered colonially useful. Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief. As Delavignette described the situation with satisfaction, the colonial administrator was not an administrator at all, but a commander and recognized as such by the African population under his control. His primary function, he asserted unequivocally, 'is to act as a chief.$^{19}$ The reserved and unobtrusive role which Lugard had hoped the British Resident would generally play in Northern Nigeria was denied in their territories by the French and Portuguese administrators, both sets of whom were prominent in the exercise of local authority.

In a statement frequently referred to as most descriptive of the methods which the French actually pursued in this region between the wars, the Governor-General of French West Africa, Joost Van Vollenhoven, remarked in 1917: The chiefs 'have no power of their own, for there are not two authorities in the cercle ... ; there is only one! Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained. Most obviously, traditional functions were distended by new demands, such as the collection of taxes, the taking of censuses, or the recruitment of labour and military conscripts. Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

Reaching beyond Africa in scope, this form of indirect administration was primarily given theoretical definition by the French. What they labelled a politique d'association received considerable recognition at the turn of the century and was enthusiastically contrasted with the older ideal of political assimilation. The conservative colonial theorist, Jules Harmand, offered one of the best explanations of this policy in a long section of his influential work, Domination et colonisa› tion, published in 1910. Association, he therein stated, is 'indirect adminis› tration, with the preservation but improved governance of the institutions of the conquered peoples, and with respect for their past'. '$^{3}$ With the publication in 1923 of Sarraut's La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, the policy was given the aura of official sanctity.\nOriginally suggested for Indochina and later extended as policy to Africa, 'association' was none the less geographically limited as a colonial practice. Only in Morocco did the French seriously consider it, and there primarily because of the attention given to indigenous affairs by the ResidentGeneral, Louis-Hubert Lyautey, who, in the initial years of the protec› torate, ruled with few restrictions from the metropolitan government. Throughout Morocco the forms of the Sherifian state were preserved, while at the local level administrative activities were strikingly similar to those proposed by Lugard. The French contrôleur civil was to perform in an advisory not a supervisory capacity with respect to the cadi, a Muslim official fulfilling magisterial functions in accordance with the shari'a. A comparable arrangement existed in the Spanish-dominated portion of Morocco where the cadi was guided in his role by the Inventare, the Spanish counterpart of the contrôleur civil. The cadi was also administratively retained as before in Italian Somaliland, but there he was joined in the responsibilities of local government by assigned warrant chiefs."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""Yet this was not what the European colonial administrators actually intended. Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading. One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

H. Johnston read a paper ""On the Ethnology of the Congo and South-western Africa."" Mr. Johnston stated that the coast of Africa, between the Senegal and Mossamedes, afforded the best ground for studying the negro and collateral races. Round about Mossamedes there were found Bushmen and Hottentots, and the latter had amalgamated to some extent with native tribes. They were distinguished by the clicks in their tongue, the Bushmen perhaps the most archaic, having eight, the Hottentots four, and the others two. When the Hottentots invaded the Mossamedes district great consternation was caused among the native tribes; but they had settled down quietly, and they suffered terribly from disease in the rainy seasons. Outside their own territory it was not probable that they would give much trouble. In most of the tribes the women had to do all the hard work, and were in consequence stronger and more muscular than the men. In one instance the women had it all their own way, and they alone had the privilege of anointing their bodies, but as the unguents they used were rancid butter and disagreeably-smelling herbs, their presence to strangers was made insupportable. One remarkable fact was that there was no great despotic chief ruling vast numbers of these people, each petty chief owning sway only over a comparatively small population. The Bantu tribes, who inhabited the Congo district, might be divided roughly into two classes, one of a low type, living next the coast, and one very much higher, inhabiting the parts in the upper reaches round Stanley Pool. The former were small and ill-made, and the latter well-built and courteous in their demeanour. The villages between Vivi and Stanley Pool had a very prosperous appearance. Here also the women did all the trading, haggling over their wares with extreme vigour, while the men were the ornamental part of the race. When any disputes arose between buyer and seller, they were referred to the market arbitrator, who invariably fined both parties so heavily that his interference was very seldom invoked. Among the Inkimbi there were some curious superstitions and ceremonies. If any person died, some one who was supposed to have caused it was compelled to drink a decoction of poisonous herbs with the view of making him vomit the evil spirit within him which had caused the mischief. They had also a kind of freemasonry among the males with certain passwords and signs. The initiation into this select body consisted of three stages. During the novitiate, which lasted six months, was taught the sacred language, which no woman was ever allowed to learn, and which no stranger had yet been able to investigate. It was probably some original archaic form of the Bantu tongue preserved among the select class, just as in other countries, Sanskrit, old Slavonic and Latin were used. Among several tribes phallic worship prevailed very largely. When a great chief died, four slaves were generally put to death, so that their spirits might go to wait upon their master, and in the burying place of any one of any consequence there were always placed a quantity of cloth, plates, knives, &c., so that the individuals might be prepared to commence life anew. The people generally were very superstitious, and had but a vague and shadowy idea of another life.

Nevertheless, no serious anxiety regarding Mr. Stanley is felt at the seat of Government of the Congo State.\n\nThe superior officials of the Congo State in Brussels believe that Mr. Stanley's journey from Yambunga to Wadelai has been accomplished in a perfectly peaceful manner.

Nevertheless, it is not believed that there is any ground for serious apprehension.

In this paper the author described his impressions of the lower part of the Niger and of the Central Soudan acquired in the course of a commercial and political mission last year to the Sultans of Sokoto and Gandu. On his way along the West Coast of Africa he noted the influence for good or evil which contact with white men has had upon the natives, and concluded that while there is much we have reason to be proud of, there is still more of which we ought to feel ashamed. He expressed the opinion that for every negro the missionaries have influenced for good by Christian teaching, a thousand had been driven into deeper degradation by other influences. He also found the settlements absurdly over-governed on a system totally unsuited to the peculiarities of barbarous races. That part of the Niger which the author traversed is divided into three sections according to their physiographical features—(1) the delta, (2) the low-lying region between the delta and the coast mountains, and (3) the irregular valley which has been cut out of the interior plateau. On reaching Lokoja, at the confluence of the Benué with the Niger and the commencement of the third section, the Central Soudan is entered. The changes which occur here, whether physiographical or ethnological, are striking in the extreme. ""Behind us are the unwashed, barbarous *sans culottes* of the coast region, with fetishism, cannibalism, and the gin bottle in congenial union; before us lies a people astir with religious activity and enthusiasm, and wonderfully far advanced in the arts and industries."" Mr. Thomson took occasion to point out the enormous influence for good—though not unmixed—which Mahomedanism exercises among the inhabitants of the Central Soudan. On reaching Rabba in the Kupé country the river journey ended, and the journey to Sokoto had to be continued by means of the ordinary African caravan. The difficulties with the porters were described and the countries traversed were sketched, the route being through Kupé and Yauri to the Gulbi-n-Gindi, which is then followed to the neighbourhood of Sokoto. In conclusion, the author described the commercial prospects of these parts. He expressed the opinion ""that in all the wide range of tropical Africa there is no more promising field for commerce than this semi-civilized region which forms the central area of the Niger basin."" He came to this conclusion not on the ground that it is more fertile or more rich in natural productions—though in those respects comparing favourably with other parts—but for other reasons. These may be briefly summarized as follows: (1) It is more densely populated than any other part of Africa, and divided into powerful and, in Africa, exceedingly well-governed empires, in which life and property are almost as sacred as in Great Britain. (2) The peoples are far advanced in civilization, and throughout Northern Africa are famed for the excellences of their various manufactures. (3) The necessary machinery and organization to work the inland trade is ready to hand, as the Houssa trader is famed for his commercial genius and enterprising spirit. (4) An efficient transport service already exists, as the horse, camel, bullock, and donkey flourish in their thousands. (5) Owing to the much sterner conditions under which the people live, labourers are to be found without stint. (6) The River Niger presents an uninterrupted waterway into the very heart of this region. (7) The country, for Africa, is eminently healthy, especially away from the immediate neighbourhood of the rivers. While thus presenting such a favourable view of the prospects of the Central Soudan, the author was careful to warn people that African trade is not to be developed with a sudden rush, but as the results of forethought and careful plodding.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1886#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.581, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""THE LATE KING M'TESA"", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The King of Uganda, whose death was announced recently, was probably the most notable potentate of purely native origin that the Dark Continent has produced. According to the estimate of Colonel Grant, who was his guest twenty-three years ago, M\'tesa was probably not more than forty-eight years of age at the time of his death, and, having succeeded his father, Suna, in 1857, he has reigned twenty-eight years. The Waganda have the names of thirty-five kings who have reigned down to the time of M\'tesa in regular succession, and this, as Colonel Grant points out, may probably account for the ""blue blood"" and vanity which certainly ran in the veins of M\'tesa. Probably, however, no other native African prince has been able to organize a state so completely and make so great an advance towards civilization as the King who has just died. Colonel Grant, who knew him well, speaks of him in terms of real respect, and his estimate is supported by Sir Samuel Baker and Mr. Stanley. As we know, the result of Mr. Stanley\'s visit was that missions were established in the country, which have had gratifying success. But M\'tesa was much perplexed when he learned that there are two Christian religions, the adherents of which are as hostile to each other as both are to Mahomedanism or heathenism. Doubtless from the European point of view M\'tesa was guilty of great cruelties; but these apparently indiscriminate sacrifices of human life were really the recognized and organized modes of administering justice in Uganda. M\'tesa himself was evidently a man governed largely by impulse. When Baker was all but defeated by the Wanyoro, a force from Uganda arriving in the distance was the cause of the dispersion of the enemy. M\'tesa forwarded letters from Baker to Livingstone by his swift-footed soldiers, who, after a journey of 600 miles, found the veteran traveller was dead. These and other facts show that M\'tesa was capable of taking a real interest in matters far outside the range of the ordinary savage mind. His army, wonderfully organized and disciplined, Mr. Stanley estimates at 125,000 men, and his fleet at 500 canoes. The population of Uganda proper is probably about 1,000,000, but, with neighbouring dependent territories, about 3,000,000. The capital is finely situated on the slopes of the north shore of Lake Victoria Nyanza. It is gratifying to learn that there have been comparatively little violence and bloodshed at the change of monarchy. It used to be the custom at the coronation for a new king to sacrifice his brothers—a custom which the latter evidently regarded as perfectly natural. M\'tesa\'s brothers, at the time of Colonel Grant\'s visit, went about in chains, but all the same, and though conscious of their fate, ""conversed and attended picnics, and boated, and played musical instruments with their brother, the King, with perfect freedom of action and of speech."" What the outside influences have been that have had a civilizing effect on Uganda before it was discovered by Europeans, we do not know; what they have been since, we do know pretty fully, and the results so far have been, on the whole, good. It is to be hoped that under the young Prince who now succeeds, this native state may be allowed to develop itself along its own lines, without any undue attempt to force it into European grooves.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1885#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.583, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Progress on the West African Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The African rivers situate in the Bight of Benin, commonly known as the Oil Rivers, have been placed under the protectorate of Great Britain.

Since the abolition of the export of slaves, these localities have been the sites of trading stations, palm oil being the chief article of export. The traders have been, with few exceptions, British, and the capitalists mostly Liverpool merchants. The natives allowed trading hulks to be anchored and commerce conducted on payment of fixed sums, known as ""comey."" Bonny, Brass, and Old Calabar are among the oldest of these trading ports, the native chiefs being also the native traders. They possessed numerous slaves who were sent with merchandise to the interior markets to collect oil, which was brought to the stations and sold to the whites. Among the Bonny chiefs was the father of Ja Ja, late King of Opobo; his son was brought up to the management of the business, and on his father\'s death he succeeded to his position. Of his enemies the most powerful was Oko Jumbo, who lost no opportunity to humiliate him. The Europeans could only let matters take their course; they regretted constant fighting of Oko Jumbo and Ja Ja, but the relations between the Europeans and natives being strictly commercial, nothing could be done. Suffering reverses, Ja Ja was forced to fly with the remnant of his people after great slaughter at the hands of Oko Jumbo.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs. Although one of the reports said that the Natives would rise against the Germans and drive them out of the river, it was not believed by the English that anything of the kind would be attempted, as the Germans a few years ago gave the Natives a lesson of their strength which they are not likely to forget.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.585, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo Free State', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'chief, but not in the numbers one hears of on the Gold Coast.

Where the population was only sparse, that might be accounted for by the tribal warfare which prevailed, and which could be suppressed by the introduction of civilisation. What was wanted was that peace should be maintained, and trade encouraged, to raise the natives to a civilised condition. The native population was divisible into three great classes—the Arab, the Negroid, and the Negro. The Arab race they met from the Nile to the Zambesi, and in the Sahara, as well as about the Great Lakes. They were the merchants and the traders, while the Negroids were the occupiers and cultivators of the soil. It was singular that, while the Arab race had endeavoured to oust the British from the Soudan, they had assisted them at Zanzibar. It was difficult to deal with them, and it would not do to drive them out as the Moors had been driven from Spain. The best thing to do would be to make them useful in Central Africa, to deal with them as we found them, and to place in their way such commercial prospects that they might be induced to abandon the slave trade. If they once got the Arab to join them, they could easily put a stop to the butcheries of the negro races by each other. As to the Negroids, they were being gradually absorbed by the other two races. The most important race to the British Empire was the Negro, who was capable of being rapidly civilised. He could not raise himself unaided, and he still remained as he had been limned 4,000 years ago upon the Egyptian frescoes. Yet as soon as he was brought into contact with civilisation he took it up rapidly, and soon became a good clerk, an engineer, a cook, or domestic servant. The Negro was far less alien to our civilisation than the Chinaman, and in the course of about 300 years there would be very little difference between him and the European except the colour of the skin. They might be weaned from slave-dealing, man-hunting, the burning of witches, and the offering of human sacrifices, and he did not know of any African prince who could be accused of anything like the beheadings and the quarterings that took place in the reigns of Henry VIII., Mary, and Elizabeth, nor did he find that any native African priesthood had been guilty of one-tenth of the horrible cruelty which had been perpetrated in Europe under the name of religion. In conclusion, he observed that if these portions of Africa with which he has been dealing could but be brought under the influence indicated, it would bring them an increase of knowledge, of wealth, and of power such as had accrued to them from their dominions in Asia.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-11-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/07_11_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.587, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sierra Leone is not a colony about which we can boast very much. It is about 102 years old, thus considerably younger than the Gambia, which almost ranks with Newfoundland as being one of the very first British possessions abroad. Sierra Leone, however, has not much to show for its century of British rule. Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary. Here at present the great Mahommedan Chief Samadu is the actual ruler, and has created one of those African empires which are easily reared by successful robbers with extravagant bloodshed and widespread depredation. Samadu has several times fought the French on the Senegambian frontier, but of late he is said to have concluded peace with them.

ORD, THE COMMISSIONER APPOINTED TO INQUIRE INTO THE CONDITION OF THE BRITISH SETTLEMENTS ON THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sierra Leone, as the most important and centrally situated of the West African settlements, naturally presents itself as the proper seat of the Central Government, from which would emanate such directions as were necessary for the general guidance of the other settlements, whilst in cases of greater emergency opportunity would be afforded to their administrators of referring for instructions, which would in many instances relieve them from the difficulty in which they are now often placed, of having to determine on their own unaided responsibility on matters of great moment to the welfare, and even safety, of their settlements.\n\nThe length of time that this system of government has been in successful operation in the West Indies will probably be considered a sufficient ground for proposing its trial in the settlements; and it seems only necessary to observe in answer to the objection that may possibly be urged against it—that it has been already tried and condemned; that the arrangement under which the Governments of the Gambia and the Gold Coast were formerly administered under the jurisdiction of Sierra Leone differed from that now contemplated in the important point, that these minor colonies were not then permitted to legislate in the smallest particular for themselves, and thus rendering their dependence upon the central Government an impediment in place of an advantage to them. It may also be added that the absence of any certain and speedy communication between the settlements in those days had, doubtless, some share in leading the Committee of 1842 to recommend the separation of all the governments.\n\nThe arrangement now contemplated will make it necessary to provide the colonies with greater facilities for intercommunication than they at present possess; and in making the necessary provision for this purpose, it will be right to consider whether it will not be also possible so to arrange that the settlements having an extensive sea-board or much internal water communication may be assisted in maintaining that regular and certain intercourse with their people, which is one of the surest guarantees for the preservation of peace.\n\nSierra Leone, as the headquarters of the general Government, will require the exclusive services of a small steamer suitable for visiting the settlements. Having several outlying dependencies, and much internal water communication, she will also need the aid of a vessel of light draft of water, capable of running up the smaller creeks.\n\nThe Gambia has only her river, for the navigation of which sufficient provision is already made by a steamer supplied by the Imperial Government, and supported partly by the colony.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.581, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'GAMBIA—ITS ADMINISTRATION AND THREATENED CESSION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—That the settlements in the River Gambia are suffering from being under the management of the Governor of Sierra Leone, or, as he is, in the technical language of Bumbledom, called ""Governor of the West African Settlements,"" is a fact patent to every practical man on the West Coast. That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise. But on the West Coast he is the legislature itself, the constructor and supervisor of all measures; in a word, he is absolute and rules over the people, who are powerless, just as he pleases, and disposes of their interests as he sees proper.""', 'last_edit_date': '1870-12-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1871#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.594, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE PARTITION OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'most advanced of the Native States of the African continent, whose territory had been the prey of outside Powers, and he showed that the dawn of African exploration and partition commenced with the Phoenicians, who navigated the Mediterranean for an unknown period, and founded the city of Utica about 1,100 B.C., nearly 300 years before the foundation of Carthage. The Phoenicians treated the part of Africa which they colonised as the British would, as the foundation of trade and commerce. The Phoenicians were followed, about 650 B.C., by the Greeks, who founded their first African colony Cyrene, on the coast of Tripoli. Then came the Carthaginians. They and the Greeks carried on a busy commerce all along the Mediterranean coast, far down to the Atlantic coast, to the mouth of the Red Sea. These were followed by the Romans, who continued an active career on the African coast until the decay of the Roman Empire.\n\nMr. Scott Keltie showed how little was known of the interior of Africa up to 150 A.D. by Ptolemy\'s map being thrown on to the sheet in the darkened theatre. This map, which was filled up haphazard fashion, gathered up, the lecturer said, all the knowledge of the continent which had accumulated during this long period of commercial activity — a knowledge which amounted to very little beyond the coasts and the Nile Valley. The next important period dealt with was the period of Arab invasion and the spread of the tenets of Mohammedanism — namely, from the seventh to the fifteenth century. In the early part of the fifteenth century commenced the ""glorious"" period of Portuguese activity, which lasted for some sixty years, during which the contour of the coast of Africa was completely laid down. This began the real modern partition of Africa, and the lecturer dwelt upon the effect which could be traced to Portuguese occupation of African territory — that occupation being marked by ruin rather than by enterprise. He rapidly traced the occupation of points of territory by Portuguese, Spanish, French, English, Dutch, Danish, and Germans, whose commerce was in ivory and slaves. He held that the opening up of the continent of Africa might be said to have begun with Bruce\'s travels in Abyssinia in the latter part of the eighteenth century. From that time until 1850 nearly the whole map of Africa became gradually filled up, and from 1850 down to the present day the southern half of the continent had received increasing attention at the hands of explorers until it also had had its main features laid down.

The larger of the two French companies was formed under the auspices of M. Gambetta, and the operations of both were so energetically conducted that the National African Company saw itself under the necessity either of entering into a commercial war or of retiring from the position. It determined upon adopting the former course, and was so far successful that at the Berlin Conference in 1884 to consider the whole West African position, the British representative was enabled to state that ""the whole trade of the Niger Basin is at the present moment exclusively in British hands."" This fact enabled Great Britain to take a different position from what she would otherwise have occupied in regard to that part of West Africa. A British Protectorate had been declared in July 1884, over the portion of the coast stretching from Lagos to the Rio del Rey and inland to the confluence of the Niger and the Binué. Great Britain took part at the Berlin Conference in the discussion of the clause by which the navigation of the Niger was rendered free to the merchant ships of all nations, and the British representative had a determining voice in the conditions under which free navigation was accorded. It should be pointed out that the existing rights of international navigation on the Niger extend only to merchant vessels; they do not include rights of free trade with countries bordering the river, and, while Great Britain allowed freedom of navigation on the portion of the Niger falling under her protection, a clause was inserted in the General Act setting forth that nothing in these obligations should hinder Great Britain from making rules of navigation not contrary to the spirit of the engagement nor should the benefits of free navigation be enjoyed by other nations except on condition of conforming to the rules so made.\n\nGermany had in 1884 declared a Protectorate of the Cameroons.

England had extended to her West African dependencies the privileges of British legitimate trade and commerce, which was a powerful vehicle for the advancement of civilisation.\n\nBringing forward the commercial advancement of the West African Colonies, he said the question had often been asked, ""Do the Colonies pay?"" He could answer with an emphatic affirmative. In 1837 the total external trade of England with all the Colonies was £28,341,471; it was now nearly £300,000,000, thus showing an increase of about ten times. The British shipping in connexion with the Colonies in 1837 was 3,677,975 tons; in 1885 it was 56,611,075 tons. The English Customs returns reckoned the exports to the Colonies in 1837 at £11,283,363; and this had since risen to £54,545,553. Her Majesty\'s Colonies, he said, furnished more than a quarter of the whole world\'s annual supply of gold. He then referred to the commercial geography of the British African Colonies, gave the value of their exports and imports, and reviewed the trade generally. The construction of a railway to the interior of Africa from Lagos was a recent proposition and a new feature in the history of the West African Colonies. It was obvious that Africa was, or would be, the only continent open for the future expansion of British manufacture; in such a case the interior would play an important part. He maintained, with eminent authorities on the subject, that by native agency alone, under foreign supervision necessarily, could tropical Africa be gradually and definitely developed on any permanent basis, and that the negro should be educated industrially and otherwise with the generous help of Europe and America. Whatever was accomplished by native agency, England certainly should carry the credit of effecting such accomplishment in the civilisation of Africa. It was beyond doubt that the English were acknowledged the best colonisers; and the marked consideration invariably shown by them to the people whom they undertook to govern, the extreme liberty and entire privileges of a British subject extended to every native, and the judicious caution characteristic of the policy of the British Government had altogether won for England this success and the preference to all other civilised nations.

The lecture was illustrated by maps.\n\nMr. Scott Keltie began by remarking that during the past six years we had seen the bulk of a great continent parcelled out among a few great Powers. That continent was no new discovery. It was not a new world like America or Australia. It entered into the oldest traditions and the most ancient history. Long, indeed, before Greece entered the field, while yet Europe was the home of wandering barbarians, long even before Abraham left his father\'s fields, before the Phœnicians had settled themselves on the Syrian coast, one of the most wonderful civilisations on record had begun to work out its destiny on the banks of that Nile, the mystery of whose source, so long sought for, had been solved only within present memory. It was not the present business to discuss the origin or trace the history of Egypt. It was enough that the continent on which the oldest, or at least one of the oldest, civilisations was born and was developed through thousands of years, was even now less known than a continent discovered only 400 years ago, and had only during the last few years been taken seriously in hand by the peoples who had the making of the world\'s commerce and the world\'s history. It was only just 400 years since Columbus stumbled upon the New World, and yet what was in brief the history of America? It was now the home of 130,000,000 of people of European origin. It was, indeed, another Europe. The first British colonial settlement was planted in Australia little more than a century since, and it was only fifty years since that the continents there had had a free hand. Now they had 4,000,000 of people of European origin, mainly of British descent, whose trade was of the value of £120,000,000 sterling a year.\n\nThis was to be contrasted with what had taken place in Africa.

It was just about a century since Europe seriously set herself to the task of exploring the northern half of that continent and of discovering the course of the great River Niger.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

To start with, many of the new farmers were not qualified to do the work for which they had been brought to Africa. There was also a general complaint that the holdings were too small. Then came floods in 1822 that destroyed all the crops. Many farmers had abandoned their land by 1823 and those that still held on had lost their original enthusiasm and were broken in spirit. With the small amounts of capital they had brought from Britain rapidly dwindling, many were either heavily in debt to the government for rations or were facing destitution. Excessive drinking was on the increase as many a broken heart sought to drown its worries and sorrows. 10 With just about a third of the original number of the farmers still on their plots in 1823 and facing formidable odds, the whole future of the Albany settlement as an agricultural venture was highly doubtful.

The rivalry for control of trade increased the social disruption and this was further intensified by population move› ments caused by the contemporaneous Nguni (also referred to as Ngoni in some of the literature) invasion. The consequent instability increased the number of people who were ready to follow enterprising leaders. In western Tanzania such warriors of fortune were known as ruga-ruga and were mainly drawn from war-captives, runaway slaves, deserting porters, social outcasts and young men who would have normally performed military service. Such armies were, nevertheless, held together by 'a certain esprit de corps and by an iron discipline that was closely modelled on the Nguni warbands'. 24 Supported by such armies, a number of traditional leaders in western Tanzania carved out new dominions for themselves. Some of them even went outside their own localities to establish empires.

At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone.

The possession of a gun by a man further signified the passage from childhood to adulthood among the Sotho. The Sotho also suspected that the Cape government did not fully trust them. Besides, the chiefs suspected that the Cape government wanted to weaken them so as to turn them into slaves. There were further measures that drove the Sotho into armed resistance. In 1879 the Cape Colony proposed to alienate the Qluthing district to white farmers as a punishment for its Sotho chief, Moorosi, who had recently rebelled. Such action was in complete violation of the British promises to Moshoeshoe that no part of his country would be alienated. Moreover, the Cape government also announced that the hut tax would be increased to £1.

Similarly there was a problem over whether to allow traders from formerly 'enemy areas' to come and buy in the markets of the caliphate. From early on, this cross-frontier trade seems to have been regarded with suspicion, and Hausa traders who had stayed behind, or local Hausa officials who wanted to restore an economy based on trading, found themselves in a difficult position.\nGiven the inexperience of the new administration and thØ potential for distrust, the burden of supervising the caliphal government was initially enormous. 'A$^{;}$ great number of complaints and disputes from all over the caliphate came to the Shaykh for arbitration. First there were the disputes among military commanders and among scholars over who should be allocated what territory to administer.

A second group of problems consisted of claims arising out ~oï misconduct by the djihäd armies during the war: cases of wrongful enslave- ment or wrongful seizure of property or land. A third group were problems among disillusioned scholars, caused in part by the Shaykh's earlier espousal of millenarian ideas, about which after 1810 he changecTnis mind. 5 Nonetheless at least one new claimant to Mahdist leadership came forward and attracted support away from the new caliphate, and he was executed by staking.

First, it must be borne in mind that for centuries Ngunispeaking communities had been slowly moving south-westwards from the Natal area. On the other hand white expansion in the opposite direction had been taking place since 1652, when Jan van Riebeeck founded a Dutch settlement at the Cape. The two movements were bound to clash somewhere. They clashed in what South African historiography used to refer to as 'Kaffir Wars'.\nSecondly, the Fish river, although recognized by the Cape government as the boundary, was often violated by the people whom it was meant to separate and keep apart. The colonists, especially cattle-farmers, violated it in search of grazing. The Africans, on the other hand, had never had any intention of recognizing, let alone respecting, this boundary, because when it was proclaimed by the Cape government many Xhosa communities had long been established along the Fish river and to the west of it. The frontier zone was regarded by many Xhosa as part of their ancestral lands of which they had been deprived by the ever-expanding Colony. For this reason, therefore, many Xhosa continued to graze and water their herds across the Fish and in defiance of the Cape government.

The tensions reached such a pitch that Boshof was forced into a tactical resignation in February 1858 and, when he withdrew his resignation, several members of the volksraad left in protest. Coupled with the internal disputes were the increasing border quarrels with Lesotho. Boshof decided to check the border disputes by invading Lesotho in March 1858.

The Lydenburgers stuck to their connections with the Cape Colony, while a further splinter Church called the Gereformeerde Kerk van SuidAfrika emerged from the NHK. Its distinguishing characteristic was a refusal by its members to sing hymns in church.\nDespite all these differences, a draft constitution providing for a presi› dent, legislature, judiciary, and army authority was produced in January 1857. The volksraad, which was dominated by Pretorius's followers, elected him the president and the Zoutpansberg leader, Johannes Schöeman, commandant-general.

The soldiers of the garrison have suddenly issued forth at night, with some of their officers, and have treated this town as if they had taken it by assault in time of war. Houses have been broken open, their inmates dragged forth and slain, or wounded, or beaten, or taken to prison; property has been seized; neither sex, nor age, nor rank, nor condition has been spared; for among the victims are found male and female, old and young, rich and poor, sick and healthy. Men, asleep in their beds by the side of their wives, have been dragged forth through the window and put to death, with cruelties that make humanity shudder. An inquest has been held on the body of an unhappy man who was treated thus, and the jury have brought in a verdict of wilful murder against the party of soldiers who committed the deed. God knows that it is no exaggeration to state that on this fearful night the soldiers went about the town indiscriminately killing, and wounding, and beating unarmed and unresisting men and helpless women. The list of casualties on the side of the people of the town, as ascertained up to the present, includes 2 men killed, and 58 men and 5 women wounded, bringing up the ascertained number to 65 persons killed and wounded, besides very many who were more or less severely beaten.

It is notorious, and is, I presume, not disputed in any quarter, that, as some of the townspeople were holding their annual native festival in the Anabfoo quarter, some soldiers rudely interrupted the festivities, and that a scuffle ensued.

This has been done, as I positively know, by advice of the agent of a certain London firm, whose power on the Coast has hitherto been paramount. It cannot be said that this power and influence over the Colonial Government has, as a general rule, been exercised for evil. Nevertheless, the agents of this house do exercise notoriously a degree of authority in the councils of the Queen's representatives, which has given rise to much remark and many sarcasms."", 'last_edit_date': '1866-07-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1866#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Confiscation and Violence on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The arrest and deportation of King Aggery of Cape Coast took place so suddenly (he was sent up to Sierra Leone by the mail steamer which brought the intelligence), that we are under the necessity of postponing any further remarks thereon until our next, when (D.V.) we shall pass the West Coast Governments more minutely under review.

We were therefore glad indeed when receiving the intelligence (which appears in some letters we this day publish) of the Fantis having conceived suspicions, or been induced to suspect, that Mr. Blankson was an accomplice in the Ashanti invasion, to hear also that he was in safe custody in Cape Coast Castle. Personally we have no more doubt of the entire innocence of Mr. Blankson than we have of our own in this matter. At the same time we can readily account for the suspicion that has fallen upon him. Mr. Blankson has been on many occasions accredited by the British authorities to settle palavers with the King of Ashanti. He has thus been continuously mixed up with Ashanti affairs in a way not always approved of by the Fantis, and was supposed to be a personal favourite with the Ashanti potentates. He is reported to have counselled the sending back of Achimpong to Comassie, a step greatly disliked by the Fantis, who had suffered under his atrocities while he was with the Dutch in Elmina. Consequently, when news came of the Ashantis having invaded the territories, notwithstanding the safe return of Achimpong to Ashanti under British safeguard, our letters from the coast teemed with accusations against Blankson for having given such advice to the Administrator as led to Achimpong being sent safely back to his family and his master. The Fanti mind became prejudiced against him, and when he joined the Fanti camp for action against the Ashantis, it would not have been difficult for a personal enemy (and most men have one or more, however blameless they may be), to infuse into the minds of a credulous and suffering people, those suspicions to which he would he have fallen victim, but for his praiseworthy arrest and detention in the castle by the British authorities. We feel convinced that an honourable and useful public career of forty years has not been now tarnished by an unworthy act, and that the unfounded nature of the suspicions levelled against him will ere long be universally acknowledged.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-05-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_05_1873#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'More on the Deportation of King Tackie by the Late Governor Ussher', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—In your impression of 1st January there is a statement, dated Accra, 27th November last, respecting King Tackie. It says that ""King Tackie and Assaf Ajaye had been plotting to bring about another war with Ashanti."" The writer ought to have told your readers how King Tackie was to make war against anybody, where his troops are, and what means he has of arming and maintaining them if he had them. ""At length, after repeated warnings,"" &c. What warnings? Did the Governor go to them, or send for them? If he wrote to them, where is the letter? If he sent to them, who was the messenger? But ""a report was circulated that the rough element of Accra intended to attempt a rescue at night,"" is truly amazing. No Governor could have believed any such report, and especially the late Governor, who knew the Accras much too well to have given credence to such nonsense. The first heard of anything wrong was that the King was in the fort, and the people were patiently waiting to hear him brought to trial; but without trial, without examination before a magistrate, he was deported to Elmina. The only feeling in Accra is indignation that any one can be imprisoned on a lettre de cachet. The man was sent for by the District Commissioner as if to speak to him, and then informed that he had just received a letter from the Governor, ordering him (the King) to be imprisoned. The ""goings on"" of late years have been so extraordinary that they must be impossible anywhere but on the Gold Coast, where the officials find they are irresponsible. How, and with what, were the Accras to attack and take the fort or the castle? Either this poor man has been thus treated for some personal ill-will against him, or the mere accusation of an informer has been of sufficient weight to crush all pretence to decency. Had the accused been brought to open trial, confronted with his accuser (but the confronting is carefully avoided), and fairly convicted, and had appeal been made to the people, ""see what your chief has been doing,"" they would themselves have taken him off the stool for attempting any such thing without their consent, as he has no right to do anything without consulting the people. It very conveniently answers a certain purpose to pretend that the kings are despotic; they have no such power. Accra is a republic, and no chief can hear any message, deliver any answer, send a message, make any law, or do anything whatever affecting the general public, except in open meeting, when any one may give his opinion as freely as any chief. It is equally a farce, invented and kept up within the last four or five years, to make it appear that the constant presence of ships of war (sometimes four) is necessary for the protection of our protectors; it answered its purpose once, and is kept up in expectation of some one being able to make capital of it again.

At length, after repeated warnings, both the Kings were arrested and lodged in the castle at Christiansburg. The principal chiefs are in favour of British rule, but a report was circulated that the rough element of Accra intended to attempt a rescue at night, and it was resolved by the Colonial Government to remove the prisoners before daybreak.\n\nTherefore, on Monday, the 8th November, the castle was surrounded by a strong force of the Houssa constabulary. H.M. gunboat Foam co-operated by sending ashore a couple of boats armed for the removal of the prisoners to the gunboat. This was successfully done, and the Foam proceeded to Elmina, where the King of Accra was lodged in the castle of Fort George. The Foam then returned to Accra, and upon the arrival of the steamship Senegal the ex-King of Djuabin was transferred to that vessel with his followers and taken to Lagos, where upon a former occasion he was a prisoner for a short time, being released by the leniency of the Government sooner than was originally intended.

Upon receiving from King Mensah's Ambassador the declaration of his Majesty's intentions, the Governor of Cape Coast Castle acted with considerable promptness in conveying information to the Home Government. The British and African steamer Corisco was chartered to proceed direct to Sierra Leone, without calling at her usual intermediate ports, and having apprised that town, which is the seat of the British Government on the West Coast of Africa, and is a depôt for a military force, to go on direct to Madeira without stopping at Teneriffe or Grand Canary, as is done in the usual course.
