The ""General History of Africa"" provides a nuanced portrayal, highlighting the diverse roles of slaves as warriors, administrators, and domestic workers, and noting that slaves did not always form a distinct class, with some achieving positions of power and trust. This complexity is further illustrated by the integration of slaves into society through acculturation and the dynamics of change within African communities, emphasizing tensions within households and kinship groups rather than broad class struggles. The return of liberated slaves, such as the 'Saros' and 'Amaros,' who formed a middle class with Victorian cultural influences, underscores the active engagement of African intellectuals in examining the societal impacts of slavery. However, the textbook does not explicitly address the persistence of slave-holding among educated Africans. In contrast, The African Times articles do highlight this aspect, noting instances where educated Africans, including British subjects in Lagos and Abeokuta, continued to hold slaves, thereby challenging the simplistic narrative. The articles also emphasize the roles of domestic slaves, who were sometimes integrated into families and had certain rights, suggesting a more intricate social dynamic. The involvement of African intellectuals in critiquing slavery and discussing the moral and societal implications of emancipation further supports the claim of an active engagement in addressing the historical and societal impacts of slavery.

Plantation slavery emerged, either in the form of slave settlements in the rural areas managed according to customary law on the Guinea coast, or Islamic law in the Muslim areas, or approximating to American-type plantations in the Indian Ocean islands. With the increased use of people of slave origin as warriors and in administrative positions at various courts, it has been estimated that in many parts of Africa slave populations could range between 25 and 50 per cent of the total population.$^{19}$ Although there were examples of slave revolts, and the particular example of the Lozi who threw off their Kololo overlords,$^{20}$ generally the slave populations did not form a distinct class. The bulk performed menial jobs, largely as agricultural labourers. However the substantial groups of warriors and domestic slaves, and the significant few who rose to positions of trust and power as successful warriors, traders or administrators, and the variations in their fortunes and life styles, made combination as a class of slaves very difficult. Only in places like Old Calabar, where the slaves were permanently alienated, with little inclination to integrate them culturally, and with a tradition of competition among the ruling elite to show off wealth by the number of slaves killed in funeral ceremonies,$^{21}$ did the slaves in the agricultural villages combine in a secret cult to demand improved conditions. Elsewhere, the prevalent ethos was acculturation and integration into the society through individual households. While the degree of integration was clearly limited - as witnessed by the number anxious to be redeemed or, having been emancipated by colonial laws, who were anxious to return to their original homes - it was real enough to suggest that the dynamics of change in most of the African communities was the tension of age and sex within each household, and of status and competition for power between the lineages and kinship groups, rather than between broad classes in society.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Social and economic transformation', 'content': 'Evidence has been accumulated to show that the nineteenth century wit› nessed major social transformations in Africa, especially in the nature of slavery and through the rise of both a warrior class and a politically powerful merchant class. These facilitated, partly caused, and were also in part the result of the changes we have noted above in the political structures and military systems. More than that, there was a growing demand for labour outside the customary bounds of the household unit, the village community or age grade associations. While the various societies remained resistant to freemen selling their labour, the predominant tendency in the nineteenth century was towards expansion of the scale of slave labour, an increase in the areas in which enforced labour was used, and a greater use of migrant labour. The general trend in the third quarter of the nineteenth century was for increased slaveholding in general, even in rural areas, an increase in the number of slaves held within each household, and an increase in the use of slaves in production under quasi-capitalist conditions, thus making their lives harsher than ever before. 18 With the intensification of political rivalries from the very beginning of the century, it became usual to press disputes over land, cattle, and even doctrinal differences to the point of completely destroying the enemy as an identifiable entity. Whole communities were incorporated into existing polities or dispersed and the bulk of the young men and women taken away as captives. Such captives were used to satisfy the increasing demand for labour in agriculture, craft production and mining and also as warriors in the emerging professional armies. The new state structures and military systems diminished the importance of the old aristocracies, whose members had depended on the accumulation of wives and extended families for their social, economic and political support, but they also created new bureaucratic groups that needed to be freed from normal agricultural duties. These new aristocracies depended not on large kinship groups as such, but on large households of clients and captives who maintained increasingly large farms to provision the household as well as groups of warriors at the battlefront. They were also deployed to produce goods for the local markets and for long-distance trade, so as to acquire the wealth necessary to attract more clients and buy imported arms and ammunition.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The abolitionist movement produced other far-reaching consequences for the area; of these, perhaps the most significant were those concerned with the modernization process.

Apart from being the factor that originally attracted European Christian missionaries, whose role in the Gulf of Guinea as modernizers is well known,42 the liberated Africans initially played the critical role of the first-generation middle class. Having been subjected to what has been described as 'the hard school of slavery',43 the liberated Africans returning from Sierra Leone were 'already fashioned elites' with a considerable attachment to cultural models of contemporary Victorian England, while among their Brazilian counterparts were artisans, traders, mechanics and 'trained cultivators of the soil'.

This was because the cost of weapons increased steadily, so that pro› gressively greater numbers of slaves had to be offered in exchange. It is not surprising, then, to find entire groups, such as the Zamberma, spe› cializing in the extraction of this 'black ore'. The main sources of supply, however, were not only the great djihäd conducted by the Muslim leaders of the north and the conflicts in Mossi territory. The trade was also fed from a host of channels that sluiced off slaves from peoples belonging to hundreds of chieftaincies, from the territories of the Tuareg to the areas bordering the trading posts on the coast. During the final decades of the nineteenth century, war broke out in virtually every decade and in virtually every region, and war meant captives. These victims were for the most part from sedentary agricultural communities, which served as a veritable breeding stock for the trade. Hence the underpopulated areas to be found in regions that were literally drained of their inhabitants. Tribute exacted in the form of captives was extremely heavy in many instances. When indigenous peoples took action to organize their own defence, they were frequently used as mercenaries in wars elsewhere, as in the case of some of the Gurunsi who fought in the ranks of the Zamberma, and the Samo (Sanan) who took part in the dynastic wars of Yatenga."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The new changes resulted from a combination of factors, including the nineteenth-century wars which, as in Yorubaland, had the effect of ren› dering the coastal areas relatively safe and attractive to migration from the hinterlands in which most of the fighting took place; the sea-borne trade which was rendered permanent by the transition from slave to 'legitimate' trade, thereby conferring a definite economic advantage on the coastal regions; and the steady growth of European interest, which enlarged the traditional role of selected coastal towns such as Lagos, Porto Novo and eventually Cotonou to take on new and increasing responsibilities not only as ports but also as political capitals of emergent colonial states and their independent African successors.\nIn all these changes, however, the economic factor would appear to have been the most dominant, especially with reference to the European presence. Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

Their learned observation endorses the popular view. But the proposition needs explanation. Humanitarianism is a Western ideology, and it is unlikely to have found any place in the minds of African distributors of the time - with very rare exceptions. But this does not mean that they were constitutionally incapable of giving up the trade, as Western supporters of slavery maintained. The continuance of the supply of exportable manpower from Africa can be logically explained in economic terms. That the distributors were black and the exporters white is irrelevant: it was a paying proposition, profitable to both trading partners, whose sole object was to make money. That was the situation at the grass roots. The continuance of the supply is to be explained in terms of the efficient working of an integrated system: and what Africans were resisting was the disruption of this system. For one thing, it would have ruined the established business of the distributors,$^{31}$ who had no other prospects, to say nothing of the chain of repercussions it would have set off on the social and political structure, both locally and further afield. In other words, so long as the barter system between the hinterland and the coast, and the coast's foreign trade, had no clear alternative to the slave trade, opposition by African slave-traders to its suppression was dictated strictly by the imperative needs to avoid commercial chaos.$^{32}$ The supposed complicity of the African distributors was no more than a reflex reaction to the immediate economic situation. This also explains the fall in the selling price of exportable manpower: it was the market's defence against growing pressure from the forces of suppression. The latter thus helped to contribute to an unsatisfactory situation. This argument needs to be modi› fied when the exportation of Africans to the north or east is considered. While the economic interests of the slave hunters and distributors are selfevident in this case too, it is hard to see what kind of economic compensa› tion accrued to the countries that were plundered. Certain individuals with strong personalities were able to consolidate their power, men like Tippu Tip, for instance, or Rabeh.

The slave trade had intensified internecine warfare for over two centuries, leading to cultural devastation on an unprecedented scale. Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent. Different methods of foreign control or interaction with the African populace naturally evoked or created different cultural responses from the displaced African. Belgian and Portuguese colonialism, as well as British settler colonialism in East Africa, are easily recognized as the most ruthless on the continent.

And this generalization seemed valid across the conventional imperial divisions. Also, with the exception of the USA, life expectancy under slavery was considerably less than in the free society, with the consequence that all the American slave societies south of the Rio Bravo (called the Rio Grande in the USA) suffered an absolute decline among the non-free sector of the population. 35 Latin Americans had a longer social experience with the institution of slavery and its concomitant social effects than their fellow colonists in British or French America. Apart from their Iberian frontier experience, Spanish and Portuguese colonists used Africans as slaves for more than a hundred years before the English and French established their slave col› onies in Barbados, Jamaica, Plymouth, Virginia, the Carolinas, Louisiana and Saint-Domingue. 36 Yet, by the nineteenth century, the differences between the slave systems in the western hemisphere were more differences of degree than funda› mental differences of kind.

In some cases, the influences from Africa were strong enough and pervasive enough to forge a genuine Afro-American culture competing with, and sometimes complementing the Europeanderived culture.\nIn the USA the political-structure imposed a rigid dichotomy between black and white in the population, relegating any individual with any degree of African ancestry to the category of black.$^{51}$ By contrast, throughout the rest of the hemisphere a three-tiered social categorization prevailed, corres› ponding to the dominant groups of black, mixed, and white.

In our desire to do justice, we printed one communication, in which one of the inculpated ministers distinctly stated that the charge of his possessing slaves was false, whereas the same individual subsequently confessed in Lagos to having nineteen, when, their names having been all given, he could no longer conceal the fact. In a short letter from another, which will appear in this number if we have space for it, there is no repetition of any such denial, but a statement that they are willing to give up their slaves. We hope the result will be that a new era of goodwill commence in Abeokuta, though we confess we agree with ""Owuyeh"" that the withdrawal of the Rev. James Johnson from the superintendence of the interior is not calculated to forward the great ends the Church Missionary Society have in view. In the P.S. to his letter ""Owuyeh"" states, what has been confirmed by other advices, that the four Sierra Leone men who were illegally convicted of slave-holding up the River Niger, and consequently released by the Gold Coast Government, have been re-apprehended, their release on bail been refused, and that they are to be tried for their offence at Lagos. He then very pertinently asks why, if this be the case, the Church Missionary Society\'s slave-holding agents at Abeokuta, who are also British subjects, should not also be brought to trial. It seems to us quite clear that if it be decided, as we should rejoice to know it were so decided, that those British subjects (Sierra Leone men) can be lawfully tried, and, if convicted, punished by the Gold Coast Courts of Justice, Her Majesty\'s Consuls in the Bights will be bound to apprehend, if possible, and send up to Lagos for trial, all other British subjects within their consular jurisdiction who can be proved to be dealers in or holders of slaves. We are sorry to believe that the number of such offenders against British law are numerous. We have heard of sad atrocities committed by some of them on their slaves in Fernando Po; and Fernando Po is not likely to be an exception. It is time this abomination of slave-holding by educated Africans on the Coast should be put an end to, and we therefore sincerely hope that if the four men from the Niger can be legally tried at Lagos, and can be proved beyond all shadow of doubt to have been engaged in the evil practice up the River Niger, they will receive a punishment calculated to deter others from similar violations of a law which they, as descendants of liberated Africans, should have considered sacred.'}, {'id': 5825, 'article_title': 'Produce Markets', 'full_section_title': 'Produce Markets', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1889#article-7', 'issue_date': '01_04_1889', 'content': 'THE POCKET MEDICAL ADVISER.  \nFor the Self-Treatment of Nervous and Functional Ailments, induced by Overwork, Worry, Excesses, and other enervating influences, and their associated Evils.  \nBY THE NEW LOCAL TREATMENT.  \n""A boon to all desiring \'self-cure\' without recourse to physic or the Family doctor."" — Medical Review.  \nA country parson writes thus — ""Your Guide has cured myself and many parishioners.""  \nPost Free, with Sketches and Details for Self-Cure (under cover), Six Stamps.  \nFrom J.

The slave might hold property, and even be his master\'s heir.""\n\nAn elevated slave might, in spite of an heir, be made to sit on his master\'s stool, govern his master\'s house, and marry his master\'s widow. Thus you will fully perceive that a Fanti slave, in point of social condition, had better and far more advantages and privileges than a West Indian slave had before he was freed. But ""slavery,"" says the _Times_, ""is slavery all the world over."" And of this the slave himself was perfectly aware. Create him Governor of the Gold Coast,—_he was a slave_. Of this there has been a number of instances which go to prove that from Governor Maclean\'s time up to the time of the abolition of slavery, matters remained unchanged.\n\nOn any morning the master might have recourse to his glass of A—n R—m, of which a great many of us are so fond, and causelessly and carelessly address his slave—the elevated slave, mind you—thus: ""Ocha, maguoa ni woo"" (""Dog, you are my slave"") without the slave having given the master any previous occasion so to address him. In our system or institution of slavery, whenever you charged a fellow with slavery, it was almost equivalent to accusing him of witchcraft. But, by-the-by, slavery is now entirely abolished, and every quondam slave is now on a footing of equality with his master.

Be sure that I am animated by no interested motive, but by a true and lively Christian feeling, in order that I may be able to put the matter in a proper light before some perplexed minds.\n\nI admit with you that slavery and slave-owning is odious and inhuman, and that no man, especially Christian, ought to exercise unlimited dominion over the will and actions of his fellow-creature. But I want to point out to you the relative position of the so-called slaves of this place. The relation in which a slave stands to his master here is that of a son to his father, with one unrestricted exception, that is, a master can force his slave against...\n**123**\n\nhis will; but even in this he can obey or disobey. I have seen many instances in which slaves have refused the service of their masters with impunity. The master, on the other hand, is responsible for the actions of his slave as he is for his own son. The slave can marry any member of his master's family, and thereby become naturalised in the family; in this case the slaves here are more free than servants in some enlightened places, who are chained to the will and wishes of their masters.\n\nBut this is not my object in writing to you, allowing, as I do, slavery and slave-owning to be inhuman, unchristian, repugnant to the Word of God. I want to know what will become of the social condition of the so-called slaves after their emancipation? To whom shall they go after they are emancipated? They have no home, no friends here; who shall take care of them when they are sick? and when they die, who shall bury them? Are there any institutions for this purpose? Or may we cast them adrift on this wide ocean of the world? I want to know if you have given this question a full thought, and have made some provision for them after they are emancipated. Unless this point is thought of, discussed, and provided for, I am afraid we are on the point of doing more moral mischief in the condition of the so-called slaves; we shall emancipate them to become the slaves again of the cruel heathen.

Dear Mr. Editor, you have been proved in many ways to be a constant friend of the African race, and, knowing your extensive views and philanthropic interest in African affairs, especially the West Coast, I doubt not that you will insert this, which will remove the error produced in the minds of the public by the above statement, that the Sierra Leone men in Fernando Po are slave-holders.\n\nI beg leave also to state that I have been for several years in Fernando Po, and do not know of any Sierra Leone man holding or dealing in slaves; that the aborigines of Fernando Po—the Boobees—though thirty have not yet been civilized out of nearly thirty thousand—are not known to be bartering their children and relatives, as almost all the heathen nations on the West Coast are in the habit of doing; that to err is human. The statement alleged against the Sierra Leone men in Fernando Po is an error, and ought to be declared as such, and be erased from the minds of the public.\n\nI am not insensible of an article inserted in this paper, between 1875 and 1876, referring to a sad atrocity committed on a servant or ""slave girl"" at Fernando Po; but the culprit was neither a Sierra Leone masculine nor feminine.\n\nIt is known generally that Sierra Leone men and others who travel on this coast, especially to the interior, are in the habit of redeeming slaves at different times and under various conditions, some of them when they are about to be killed, others under torture and ill-treatment; many of whom so redeemed have been taken to Lagos and Sierra Leone, and treated as the law provides, enjoying the advantages of civilization, and can testify to-day to this fact. But to know that some are really dealing in slaves, as it is reported, if it be true, is distressing in heart; and I agree with you that they should ""be lawfully tried, and, if found guilty, punished by the Gold Coast courts of justice"" as an example.\n\nH.

We have never forgotten that it was alleged the great opposition at Lagos against the annexation of that place to the British Crown, was promoted by educated native British subjects, who could no longer be slaveholders there under British rule. But we hoped the influence of British Lagos would so prevail, and the fear of British Lagos be so felt, that in Abeokuta as well as in Lagos, no British subject, or so-called Christian, would lay himself open to legal pains and penalties and the condemnation of good men, by buying, holding, or selling his fellow-creatures as slaves. But the deposition and letter alluded to disabuse us on this head. The evil leaven seems to be there in power. Its presence is disgraceful to those educated Africans who are leavened by it. This Robbio, this so-called Christian slaveholder of Abeokuta—this seemingly pitiless master of a Christian slave—whose tender mercies to his slave seem to have been, indeed, as cruel as those of any pagan slaveholder could have been, was, we believe, some two or three years in Manchester, educating there as a mechanic and engineer. We do not recollect whether he had been a slave liberated at Sierra Leone, or was sent direct from Abeokuta for instruction. We believe, however, that he is a British subject, and if so, and that deposition be a true statement of facts, we hope that should he come within the reach of British power, he will be made an example of. It seems to us, moreover, quite clear that the indulgence to slaveholders at Lagos, of which we have so often complained, should now cease, and the recommendation of the Committee of the House of Commons be carried out by an immediate abolition of all slavery within the precincts of the colony. We hope, too, that we shall never again hear of a slave who has sought refuge there being delivered up to her former master in a heathen town, even though he be a king, and demand her on the ground of her being one of his wives, or intended wives, and promise that she shall not be punished—a promise, the value of which in such cases is less than that of a grain of common sand. And a proclamation should also issue that native or other British subjects in Abeokuta, or elsewhere in Africa (as in all other parts of the world), against whom proof may be obtained that they are holders, or buyers, or sellers of slaves will be severely punished. We recommend, moreover, to missionaries of all Christian churches to follow from henceforth the course so successfully pursued during the last two years by the Basle Mission on the Gold Coast, where no slaveholder can be admitted to be a communicant. Nothing short of a practical protest of this kind against slaveholding can suffice to eradicate this great demoralizer from among professing African Christians living in native territories.

The neck is inserted in the fork, and an iron bar driven in across from one end of the fork to the other, and rivetted; the other end is tied at night to a tree, or to the ceiling of a hut, and the neck being firm in the fork, the slave is held off from unclosing it. It is excessively troublesome to the wearer, and when marching two yokes are tied together by their free ends, and loads put on the slaves\' heads besides. Women having in addition to the yoke and load a child on the backs, have said to me on passing, \'They are killing me; if they would take off the yoke, I could manage the load and child, but I shall die with three loads.\' One who spoke thus did die, and the poor little girl, her child perished of starvation. I interceded for some; but, when unyoked, off they bounded into the long grass, and I was gently blamed for not caring to preserve the owner\'s property! After a day\'s march under a broiling vertical sun, with yokes and heavy loads, the strongest are exhausted. The party of twelve above mentioned were sitting singing and laughing.

The chorus then struck in was the name of the man who had sold each of them, and then followed the general laugh, in which at first I saw no bitterness. Perembe, an old man, of at least 104 years, had been one of the sellers. In accordance with African belief, they had no doubt of being soon able, by ghost power, to kill even him. Their refrain was—\n\n""Ob, ob, oh!  \nBird of freedom, oh!  \nYou sold me, oh, oh, oh!  \nI shall haunt you, oh, oh, oh!""\n\nThe laughter told not of mirth, but of the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter.

Insama himself had been a sort of Napoleon for fighting and conquering in his younger days, was exactly like the ancient Assyrians sculptured on the Nineveh marbles as Nimrod and others; and he showed himself to be one of ourselves by habitually indulging in copious potations of beer, called *pombe*, and had become what Nathaniel Hawthorne called \'bulbous\' below the ribs.

In almost every number appear notices of sales of slaves with prices and descriptions, the prices varying from 25 to 60 dollars, according to age and good looks.

The tortures inflicted upon young boys destined to become guardians of the harem cannot here be described.\n\nThe following extract translated from *Al Moghreb Al-Aksa* will show that even these poor slaves are not entirely devoid of human sympathy: ""A short time ago a slave woman was set free by her master as a reward for her excellent behaviour and industry.

One day, passing through a street, she heard the auctioneer selling a negress. The conscience of the former slave was touched and her sympathy aroused by the remembrance of her former life.

They are far from being the stupid race we so often hear them called. Keen at a bargain, they are often a match for some of us in that boasted Yankee trait. Apt to learn, quick to understand and to appreciate advantages, they are a people easy to assume and appropriate the best results of civilization—brave in the defence of their rights and homes, yet not aggressive, except when forced by circumstances and their teachings. We forget the whole history of this people in looking only at some particular phase or trait. Their land, the field of the slave-stealer for centuries, has been the scene of cruelty, fraud, and all the worst forms of vice. A people educated by so long a course of schooling in its vicissitudes might well be cruel and vicious. The land has been hunted, from Egypt to the Cape of Good Hope, by foreign and native stealers. Tribes have been driven for self-protection, or by greed of gain, to make captures from other tribes or other parts of their own. To show the debasing power of slavery and slave-hunting, let me say that I have seen slaves brought to the coast from the central parts of Africa who were the most abject specimens of the human race I have ever known—brought by a strong, stalwart tribe, noble in bearing, and brave in war; and these, too, were the same tribe or people only a comparatively short time before. Why this great difference? A simple explanation is only required to show it all. Together and at peace, they had a generous and varied diet of animal and vegetable food, for they had extent of territory in which to hunt and gather; but divided and at war, fighting for self-protection, one party gained the supremacy. Then the other were a defeated people; circumscribed within small limits, unable to hunt, they were soon confined to vegetable diet alone, and then to a single kind, and often to a few simple roots; courage gone, they were reduced to servitude and slavery, and brought to a market.

Rua, a very large section of country north and west of Cazembe\'s, but still in the same inland region, is peopled by men very like those of Insama and Cazembe. An Arab, Syde Bin Habib, went to trade in Rua two years ago, and as the Arabs usually do where the natives have no guns, Syde Bin Habib\'s elder brother carried matters with a high hand. The Rua men observed that the elder brother slept in a white tent, and, pitching their spears into it by night, killed him. As Moslems never forgive bloodshed, the younger brother forthwith ran amuck on all indiscriminately in a large district. Let it not be supposed that any of these people are like the American Indians—insatiable, bloodthirsty savages, who will not be reclaimed or enter into terms of lasting friendship with fair-dealing strangers. Had the actual murderers been demanded, and a little time been granted, I feel morally certain, from many other instances among tribes who, like the Ba Rua, have not been spoiled by Arab traders, they would all have been given up. The chiefs of the country would, first of all, have specified the crime of which the elder brother was guilty, and who had been led to avenge it. It is very likely that they would stipulate that no other should be punished but the actual perpetrator. Domestic slaves acting under his orders would be considered free from blame. I know of nothing that distinguishes the uncontaminated Africans from other degraded peoples more than their entire reasonableness and good sense. It is different after they have had wives, children, and relatives kidnapped; but that is more than human nature, civilised or savage, can bear. In the case in question indiscriminate slaughter, capture, and plunder took place. A very large number of very fine young men were captured and secured in chains and wooden yokes. I came near the party of Syde Bin Habib, close to the point where a rent in the mountains of Rua allows the escape of the great river Lualaba out of Lake Moero. And here I had for the first time an opportunity of observing the difference between slaves and freemen made captives. When fairly across Lualaba Syde thought his captives safe, and got rid of the trouble of attending to and watching the chained gangs by taking off both chains and yokes. All declared their joy, and perfect willingness to follow Syde to the end of the world or elsewhere, but next morning twenty-two made clear off to the mountains. Many more, on seeing the broad Lualaba roll between them and the homes of their infancy, lost all heart, and in three days eight of them died. The had no complaint but pain in the heart, and they pointed out its seat correctly; though many believe that the heart is situated underneath the top of the sternum or breast-bone. This to me was the most startling death I ever saw. They evidently died of broken-heartedness, and the Arabs wondered, \'seeing they had plenty to eat.\' I saw the others perish, particularly a very fine boy of ten or twelve years of age. When asked if he felt ill he put his hand correctly and exactly over the heart. He was kindly carried, and as he breathed out his soul was laid gently on the side of the path. The captors were not unusually cruel. They were callous—slaving had hardened their hearts. When Syde, who was an old friend of mine, crossed the Lualaba, he heard that I was in a village where a company of slave traders had been furiously assaulted for three days by justly-incensed Babeemba. I would not fight nor allow my people to fire if I saw them, because the Babeemba had been especially kind to me. Syde sent a party of his own people to invite me to leave the village by night, and come to him. He showed himself the opposite of hard-hearted; but slaving \'hardens all within, and petrifies the feelings.\' It is hard for the victims, and for the victimisers.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1872#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SLAVERY IN CENTRAL AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'On Feb. 19, a paper on ""Slavery in its relation to Trade in Tropical Africa"" was read before the Society of Arts, by Commander V. L. Cameron, R.N., C.B. The Earl of Dundonald was in the chair.\n\nCommander Lovett Cameron, in the course of his opening remarks, said the slave trade went on all round the continent of Africa, and commerce had gone on with it. Our trade with the West Coast of Africa had gone on since the time of the Tudors. For centuries that trade was in slaves, and its increase was slow; but after several blows had been struck at that trade—among others by the liberation of slaves in the West Indian Islands, in America, and in Cuba—instead of their being any injury done to our commerce, our trade with the West Coast of Africa increased by leaps and bounds. It was only in 1850 or shortly after that we attacked a great nest of slave dealers in Lagos, and in 1861 it was made a British colony. Up to that time there had been no trade there except in slaves; but last year the trade of Lagos amounted to £357,831 imports, and £538,980 exports. And yet only thirty-eight years ago that place was of absolutely no value to us for legitimate commerce. On the Gold Coast slavery had been practically abolished by the British Government, but yet there was a good deal still existing owing to the native customs of the people. Even if the export of slaves from Africa was prevented entirely, the internal trade in them would still be enormous.\n\nFormerly the slave trade was subsidiary to the ivory trade, but when porters were no longer wanted for the latter, the former remained, only the men were killed and the women and children carried away. It had been said that domestic slavery must be allowed, and that was a very difficult question to settle. In his opinion, we should, as in India, abolish the legal status of slavery, but should not rout out all the households where no complaint was made. As long as domestic slavery existed there would be a market for slaves. We must have nothing to do with slavery; while the slave trade continued it was impossible for legitimate commerce to go on as it should! If the slave trade were done away with, they would find that all other trade would flourish.\n\nIn answer to questions Commander Lovett Cameron said he had avoided speaking of the Germans for diplomatic reasons.\n\nHe had a plan for the total abolition of slavery in Africa, which he hoped to explain shortly. It was, in brief, to establish a barricade across the country by the way of the lakes, and to get authority to maintain order on that line.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, on February 26, presided over a large meeting, held in Exeter Hall, when two African explorers, Commander Cameron and Captain Hore, were announced to speak.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-03-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_03_1889#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Slavery and the Slave-trade', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It is with very great pain that we have felt ourselves compelled to notice in other than terms of commendation any article published by those who, like ourselves, are working for the good of Africa and the African people. But the unpleasant necessity is forced upon us by a sense of duty. It was impossible that we could allow the article headed ""Slave-trade,"" which we have copied verbatim from the missionary paper, the Iwe Irohin, of Abeokuta, to pass unnoticed. When we see the hitherto consistent friends of the high social morality of the Gospel, and preachers of the universal brotherhood of mankind, for all of whom, if they will accept the salvation He has purchased for them, Christ, our Saviour, died, fall into such grievous error, we mourn bitterly over the declension which we feel we are right in attributing to the heathen influences by which they are surrounded.\n\nIt is not our desire to gain any distinction by argument or invective over our fellow-labourers who have so unhappily yielded for a moment to the power of circumstances. In calling attention to their error, we shall only state that it has deeply grieved many of their oldest friends in this country, who consider they have made their error yet more serious in appending their excuse of slavery to the intelligence of the capture of a slave-ship near Whydah. They know but too well that the heathen of Abeokuta are manstealers. In justifying the practice of slavery to which the heathen cling, and which is working such frightful evils—which is, indeed, at the root of the social degradation of the country—they are, for a fancied momentary benefit, neutralising to a very great extent their powers for good. Any departure from the lofty standard of Christian principle must do this. And by implication, in thus defending slavery, without one word in condemnation of the manstealing practised around them, or of the horrible trade in which the slave-ship whose capture they record was engaged, they may be supposed, although we are sure they had no such intention, to justify both the one and the other.\n\nIf we had previously, which we had not, entertained the least doubt of the correctness of our view, that for the spread of civilisation and Christianity in Africa there must be the influence of a Christian power behind and around the propagators of the truth, that doubt would now have been removed. Such a defence or excuse of slavery would never have been published by a Christian missionary in Sierra Leone, or in Lagos. ""The tendency of Christianity"" is not to ""diminish"" only, but to extirpate slavery, which is diametrically opposed to the great command which our Saviour placed next after the love of God himself.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

In Dahomey, on the other hand, the slave trade was one of the mainstays of the ruling house, which delegated the running of it to its chief vassals. In 1818 King Gezo, who was in debt to the Brazilian mulatto Francisco Felix Da Souza, appointed Da Souza as chacha, a 'white-man's chief who acted as an economic adviser and administrator of the Whydah trade. This office survived the death of the first chacha in 1849 and was inherited by Da Souza's son. It was management on a grand scale: the chachas kept a stock of Western goods, offset bookkeeping debits and credits, prepared cargoes in advance to facilitate speedy loading, collected taxes, checked the movements of white foreigners, and provided entertainment for their customers. This economic apparatus was capable of being adapted to other types of produce. Produce for the slave trade, which was in the hands of the chiefs, was secured by annual military expeditions, not always victorious, against the neighbouring countries, principally the Yoruba.

That is, although Igboland provided most of the slaves sold at the ports of Bonny, and Elem Kalahari, in the Niger delta, and at Calabar on the Cross river estuary, the Igbo did not come into direct contact with the Europeans before the nineteenth century. Also, the Igbo country was not reached by visiting Europeans until the closing years of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century. And these initial contacts took place along such river routes as the Niger, the Imo, and the Cross river. Thus the communities at the market centres on the rivers at which the coastal middlemen met hinterland traders became better known than others. The Aro who controlled the internal trade routes and some of the markets at which the coastal middlemen purchased slaves and, later, palm oil and palm kernels became notorious for their abilities both as traders and as the operators of a well-reputed oracle. Similarly, the Ndoki towns of Akwette and Ohombele on the Imo river served as the markets for Bonny and Opobo.

And for the rest of the century, the internal trade for slaves among the coastal peoples increased because of the demands of the palm-oil trade.

It could not be lightly undertaken, but having been undertaken, I think I may assure the deputation that, so far as the very latest reports have been received, it has been carried through successfully, and with far fewer difficulties and delays than one could have reasonably anticipated. It may be interesting to the deputation if I mention one or two of the received facts with regard to it. There have been a few instances of slave-dealing since the abolition ordinances, but wherever the transactions have come to light they have been repressed, and repressed very firmly and with great determination, by the local Government. I think, moreover, that the scheme of emancipation is widely and well known throughout the whole of the Protectorate. It was at one time a question as to how far it was generally understood, but I think that doubt is at an end. Of course it was impossible not to entertain apprehension that in so great a social change as that of the emancipation of the slaves some disturbance to industry might take place, but I am within the truth when I state that the latest despatches show no sign of serious, still less of permanent, disturbance of trade and industry. In some recent telegrams or reports it was stated that trade was falling off at Accra. Well, trade no doubt has been slack at Accra, but it has been proportionately greater at some other places on the Coast; and the revenue, I am happy to believe, is generally holding its own. Too much importance cannot be attached to the maintenance of revenue on the Gold Coast. It is there, as in many other places, the secret of good policy, and so long as we can maintain a sufficient revenue, so long we shall be able to carry out such reforms as the state of things and society permits. That has hitherto been the case. It has resulted in the maintenance of general tranquillity, with an apparently great satisfaction along the whole of the Coast. I think there remains one other subject for me to touch upon, and that is the allusion to Natal. I can only say on that subject—which was one that cost me a great deal of painful consideration—that I simply did that which I believed to be right in the matter, and as time goes on, when the angry feelings which have been aroused have had time to subside, I doubt not more justice will be done to the course which I have taken, and it will be seen that the action taken was quite as much in the interest of the whole part of the colony as it was in the interests of the other and larger portion of Her Majesty\'s subjects. Natal is a magnificent country, but it merely forms part of the still larger territory of South Africa, and for South Africa I contemplate in the future a development of vast prosperity, the natural resources of that country are so great; the native population, which has been, perhaps, a source of difficulty and danger, can, as I believe, be converted into a source of strength. Some may think that there is a difference between these great objects—the material development of the country, and the proper treatment of the natives; but I believe, for my own part, that, so far from there being any difference, they are quite consistent. It is unnecessary to say another word on that subject. I desire, for my own part, as far as possible, that irritation should now disappear, for I very often think \'the least said,\' to use a very homely phrase, \'the sooner mended.\'""'}]","[{'document_title': 'Alleged Human Sacrifices in Jebu Remo', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A *Reuter\'s* telegram from Lagos, dated August 10, stated: ""Sir G.

Rua, a very large section of country north and west of Cazembe\'s, but still in the same inland region, is peopled by men very like those of Insama and Cazembe. An Arab, Syde Bin Habib, went to trade in Rua two years ago, and as the Arabs usually do where the natives have no guns, Syde Bin Habib\'s elder brother carried matters with a high hand. The Rua men observed that the elder brother slept in a white tent, and, pitching their spears into it by night, killed him. As Moslems never forgive bloodshed, the younger brother forthwith ran amuck on all indiscriminately in a large district. Let it not be supposed that any of these people are like the American Indians—insatiable, bloodthirsty savages, who will not be reclaimed or enter into terms of lasting friendship with fair-dealing strangers. Had the actual murderers been demanded, and a little time been granted, I feel morally certain, from many other instances among tribes who, like the Ba Rua, have not been spoiled by Arab traders, they would all have been given up. The chiefs of the country would, first of all, have specified the crime of which the elder brother was guilty, and who had been led to avenge it. It is very likely that they would stipulate that no other should be punished but the actual perpetrator. Domestic slaves acting under his orders would be considered free from blame. I know of nothing that distinguishes the uncontaminated Africans from other degraded peoples more than their entire reasonableness and good sense. It is different after they have had wives, children, and relatives kidnapped; but that is more than human nature, civilised or savage, can bear. In the case in question indiscriminate slaughter, capture, and plunder took place. A very large number of very fine young men were captured and secured in chains and wooden yokes. I came near the party of Syde Bin Habib, close to the point where a rent in the mountains of Rua allows the escape of the great river Lualaba out of Lake Moero. And here I had for the first time an opportunity of observing the difference between slaves and freemen made captives. When fairly across Lualaba Syde thought his captives safe, and got rid of the trouble of attending to and watching the chained gangs by taking off both chains and yokes. All declared their joy, and perfect willingness to follow Syde to the end of the world or elsewhere, but next morning twenty-two made clear off to the mountains. Many more, on seeing the broad Lualaba roll between them and the homes of their infancy, lost all heart, and in three days eight of them died. The had no complaint but pain in the heart, and they pointed out its seat correctly; though many believe that the heart is situated underneath the top of the sternum or breast-bone. This to me was the most startling death I ever saw. They evidently died of broken-heartedness, and the Arabs wondered, \'seeing they had plenty to eat.\' I saw the others perish, particularly a very fine boy of ten or twelve years of age. When asked if he felt ill he put his hand correctly and exactly over the heart. He was kindly carried, and as he breathed out his soul was laid gently on the side of the path. The captors were not unusually cruel. They were callous—slaving had hardened their hearts. When Syde, who was an old friend of mine, crossed the Lualaba, he heard that I was in a village where a company of slave traders had been furiously assaulted for three days by justly-incensed Babeemba. I would not fight nor allow my people to fire if I saw them, because the Babeemba had been especially kind to me. Syde sent a party of his own people to invite me to leave the village by night, and come to him. He showed himself the opposite of hard-hearted; but slaving \'hardens all within, and petrifies the feelings.\' It is hard for the victims, and for the victimisers.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1872#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.613, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Report of the Commissioner appointed to Inquire into the Condition of the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have numerous treaties with the natives, beginning from 1826; they relate, in some instances, to cessions of territory, and always contain engagements for the protection of trade, the abolition of slavery, and the preservation of peace.

The great future wealth of the interior plateaux will certainly lie in their mineral deposits, the riches of the West Coast region lie in its numerous and valuable vegetable products, of which the most striking are palm oil, and ground nuts, benniseed, shea butter, rubber, gums, spices, cotton, dyes, and valuable timbers, among which ebony occupies a prominent place. With regard to animal products, I might mention ivory and monkey skins. Whereas some of the great races of the interior speak languages which connect them with the Hamitic and Semitic families. The native inhabitants of the West Coast are all that there is of most typically Negro in character; yet I do not mean they are races of particularly low development; on the contrary, the typical Negro is a fine specimen of man, and is by no means as low in his mental state as the races of Polynesia and America. I may cite the Kru tribes of that portion of West Africa which is known as Liberia, a country inhabited by an industrious, energetic, hardworking, stalwart population of free men. An element of heterogeneous ex-slave settlers among the tribes of the coast may be found in some parts of the Colonies of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos. These people represent the Nemesis which invariably follows national crimes. We and our American children indulged to a greater extent than any other European nation in the African slave trade, and, as our wrong-doing was violent and exaggerated, so to a certain extent was the abrupt reparation which followed. Although I would not minimise the work done by our blockade on the West Coast, the abolition of the slave trade was more effectually brought about by the abolition of slavery in the United States of America. One result of our suppression of the slave trade in West Africa has not been altogether advantageous. I refer to the Slave Colonies established at Sierra Leone, and at Fernando Po and other points on the coast. It may be taken that the slaves exported from any district are the least worthy people in it, and the result is that a large proportion of this population is descended from the sweepings of West Africa, and has not yet passed through sufficient generations to eliminate the ancestral badness of its progenitors. So, although here and there a negro has shown what the race can attain to under favourable circumstances, still the bulk of the ""S\'a Leone"" people who are scattered up and down the coast are of an undesirable character, and the cause of indiscriminating blame on the part of superficial observers which is most unjustly laid on the shoulders of the entire population of West Africa; whereas many of these races are superior in intelligence, enterprise, and integrity to any of our negro fellow-subjects in South Africa or the West Indies. What admirable recruits to civilised society can be obtained from many of these people may be instanced by such men as Bishop Crowther, Archdeacons Johnson and Crowther, Samuel Lewis, and other divines and lawyers and officials in West Africa, who are on a par with well-educated white men, and in some cases superior in intelligence and acquirements to the whites with whom they come in contact. It is absurd, however, to regard the Negro race, as a whole, on the same average level as the European—they are far below us. Take them in their native wilds, and they are what we were before Julius Caesar landed in this country; indeed, in many cases they are not 2,000 years behind us, but 10,000. They are in the condition of some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and Gaul, and Spain, whose history we can dimly spell out from their implements and scattered remains, who were undoubtedly cannibals and probably naked, and leading a brutish life. Yet we can in a few years drag them from the condition that prevailed 2,000 years before Christ into the year of grace 1889. We can take a cannibal from the Upper Cross River, and transport him to the centres of civilisation in England or America, where everything represents the utmost result of our present development; but what will be usually the result both with the individual and the race? The savage mind will be unable to grasp and assimilate one-third of the wonders presented to his consideration, and will probably even suffer from the shock. We cannot expect the negroes of West Africa to become all at once intelligent, self-governing people. For many years the white races must be their guardians and educators, and we must educate the negro by force if necessary, leaving him to understand us afterwards, when we have raised him to a condition to do so. This, then, is our mission in West Africa: to instruct the natives that idleness is the eighth deadly sin; next, to so instruct the native as to the existence of the resources of this country; and, lastly, to educate him in the principles of civilised society, and so assimilate his views with our own that he and we may be bound together with the ties of commerce and Empire.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.6, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo Free State', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'chief, but not in the numbers one hears of on the Gold Coast.

The official coinage is in French five-franc pieces, and the European language most commonly heard is French.

It was really the cessation of the slave traffic that brought about the downfall of our prosperity in the Gambia, for it does not grow the oil palm; and ground nuts, now its chief article of export, were not sufficiently in vogue during the first quarter of this century to supply the place of slaves as a source of profit; and the Gambia has remained a restricted and not very valuable British possession, our actual rule being confined to a very small area, just at the mouth of the river, and one or two islets in its middle course.

The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

There was a settlement there before the British Government commenced its crusade against the traffic in human beings, but the population was very small, and the colony had a precarious existence until it was placed under the control of the African Institution, an organization established for the improvement of the western part of Africa. This body, which had the support of all the great men engaged in the anti-slavery movement in England, directed its efforts to the amelioration of the condition of the freed slaves, and did in its time an immense amount of good. Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, was made the head-quarters of the association on the coast, and the captured slaves were landed and settled there. An idea of the extent to which this kind of colonization was carried may be gathered from the fact that the total number of slaves emancipated at Sierra Leone between June, 1819, and January, 1833, was 27,697. The exertions of the association were not merely directed to the settlement of the slaves. A system of education was inaugurated, and the settlers were trained in useful arts. The funds of the association were not always well employed, but the general result of their operations is highly satisfactory, and such as to reflect high honour upon the benevolence of the English people. Sierra Leone is now a flourishing colony, and its inhabitants are further advanced on the paths of civilization than, perhaps, any other body of Africans. Education is widely diffused amongst the community, and many of the higher classes have obtained academic distinction in England, and risen to positions of eminence in their own country. In every walk of life, descendants of emancipated slaves are distinguishing themselves, and justifying the confidence of those who believe in the possibility of the civilization of the negro race.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1888#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.603, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Some Minor Trading Stations on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'South-east of Sierra Leone lies the Republic of Liberia.

Their self-government has been sneered at, but it is wonderful that people without any experience should have done as well as they have. Commercial morality is not at a high standard, and more might be done in cultivation and improvement of the fertile country which is under the Liberian flag; and the Liberians would be wise if they did not insist upon negro blood being present in the veins of all their citizens. But many of the faults we see are faults of ignorance, and others arise from the bad example of whites. The coffee plantations of Liberia might be increased almost to an infinite extent, and through Liberia there should be opened up a route to the interior which would bring a large trade to the coast. Between Liberia and the French possession at Grand Bassam, on the frontier of the Gold Coast Colony, lies a long strip of coast inhabited principally by Kroomen, who trade with Bristol ships, but who will tell nothing of the interior; and hitherto the trade has been carried on by sailing ships from Bristol, which cruise up and down the coast. Till quite lately, only one or two white men have lived on shore, the places where the captains and supercargoes of the British ships landed being few and far between; but now the German flag has been hoisted over some small trading stations, and probably soon we shall find that these form pretexts for annexation to the German empire.

But for this clause no claim could be properly put forward for compensation on the ground of injury done to the owners by the refusal of the Courts to recognise the property of one man in another. The institution of slavery is maintained only by force of law in any country in which it flourishes. British law will not allow its Courts to be prostituted to the maintenance of injustice, and all that we do when we abolish the legal _status_ of slavery is to refuse the countenance of the law to claims which we believe to be unjustifiable when they are advanced by one man over another. Compensation in Zanzibar is, in certain circumstances, to be paid, not for exercising the right to administer justice in the Courts, but because a personal guarantee was given to special slave owners that the _status_ of their slaves should not be altered. It is, in fact, a concession to the Moslem view of slave owning. The number of these lawfully held slaves, as has been seen, is small. Compensation will be given only for those who actually claim their freedom, and the sum required is not likely to amount to any formidable total. The Sultan has so loyally accepted the British point of view that we only meet him in a reciprocal spirit when we promise him some help in the event of any financial difficulties which may result.

If such barbarism were tolerated, it could not be wondered at that civilisation in French Africa made no progress.\n\nM. Chautemps, Minister for the Colonies, made a somewhat lame and inconclusive reply. He said the facts alleged by M. Isaac were exaggerations. The natives of the village that had been burned down for resisting the French authorities had not been made slaves of; they had been merely distributed among six other villages, where they would have to remain for six years under the surveillance of responsible native chiefs. At that distance, it was difficult to form an opinion, but he had every confidence in the moderation of the authorities. He admitted that sixteen persons had, after the capture of the village of Djuni, been handed over to the care of native non-commissioned officers and riflemen. But this measure had been a perfect blessing to the captives.

The production areas, though sometimes 400-500 km distant, were mostly near the coast. Transactions were personal between local chiefs, caravaneers, brokers and agents. In Dahomey, on the other hand, the slave trade was one of the mainstays of the ruling house, which delegated the running of it to its chief vassals. In 1818 King Gezo, who was in debt to the Brazilian mulatto Francisco Felix Da Souza, appointed Da Souza as chacha, a 'white-man's chief who acted as an economic adviser and administrator of the Whydah trade. This office survived the death of the first chacha in 1849 and was inherited by Da Souza's son. It was management on a grand scale: the chachas kept a stock of Western goods, offset bookkeeping debits and credits, prepared cargoes in advance to facilitate speedy loading, collected taxes, checked the movements of white foreigners, and provided entertainment for their customers. This economic apparatus was capable of being adapted to other types of produce. Produce for the slave trade, which was in the hands of the chiefs, was secured by annual military expeditions, not always victorious, against the neighbouring countries, principally the Yoruba. It also came from the Central Sudan - whence captives were distributed, moreover, to the north and to Egypt - by caravans, which split up their loads at the border: the blacks earmarked for export, who were strong, were kept aside and incorporated in the ordinary porterage teams.$^{25}$ Further east, from Badagry to the borders of the kingdom of Benin, prolonged strife among the Yoruba people glutted the Whydah market. Local rulers and the black and white slave-traders of the lagoons supplied the heavy demand from the Portuguese and Brazilians, who made the best part of their fortune out of it before turning their hands to other kinds of trade. 26 East of Cape Formosa, among the rivers of the Niger delta from the Nun to Old Calabar, the slave trade was still run by the remarkable machinery that came into play in the last third of the eighteenth century, though this was already being applied to other types of trade that were carried on simultaneously.

It was taken via chains of dealers, or the usual supply channels, to the distribution points.$^{27}$ There again, transactions were governed by well-tried procedures. The price per slave had been fixed in advance in the local money of account, the copper bar, equivalent to a specific quantity of goods - the same as in earlier periods. In 1825 and 1829 men and women were worth 67 bars, and the price went down as low as 45 or 50. In terms of the value of the landed cargo, the price per slave was 33 Spanish dollars, of which 8-10 per cent went to the distributors by way of commission. At Duke Town, Duke Ephraim's city in Old Calabar, the heads of other more or less rival houses, Egbo Eyo, Tom Honesty and Ogan Henshaw, helped to make up cargoes with slaves or foodstuffs. Forty thousand yams cost 2000 bars, the price of forty slaves. Around 1830 the biggest share of the trade was reputedly carried on at Bonny. 28 Estimates of the volume of the slave trade during the sixty years of the abolitionist period can only be in terms of orders of magnitude. From 1807 to 1867, between Senegal and Mozambique, 4000 European and American ships carried out perhaps 5000 slaving expeditions, representing a dis› placement of 1000 000 metric tonnes.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

Their learned observation endorses the popular view. But the proposition needs explanation. Humanitarianism is a Western ideology, and it is unlikely to have found any place in the minds of African distributors of the time - with very rare exceptions. But this does not mean that they were constitutionally incapable of giving up the trade, as Western supporters of slavery maintained. The continuance of the supply of exportable manpower from Africa can be logically explained in economic terms. That the distributors were black and the exporters white is irrelevant: it was a paying proposition, profitable to both trading partners, whose sole object was to make money. That was the situation at the grass roots. The continuance of the supply is to be explained in terms of the efficient working of an integrated system: and what Africans were resisting was the disruption of this system. For one thing, it would have ruined the established business of the distributors,$^{31}$ who had no other prospects, to say nothing of the chain of repercussions it would have set off on the social and political structure, both locally and further afield. In other words, so long as the barter system between the hinterland and the coast, and the coast's foreign trade, had no clear alternative to the slave trade, opposition by African slave-traders to its suppression was dictated strictly by the imperative needs to avoid commercial chaos.$^{32}$ The supposed complicity of the African distributors was no more than a reflex reaction to the immediate economic situation. This also explains the fall in the selling price of exportable manpower: it was the market's defence against growing pressure from the forces of suppression. The latter thus helped to contribute to an unsatisfactory situation. This argument needs to be modi› fied when the exportation of Africans to the north or east is considered. While the economic interests of the slave hunters and distributors are selfevident in this case too, it is hard to see what kind of economic compensa› tion accrued to the countries that were plundered.

First, the manner in which slaves were procured tended to destroy social and political structures. Social outcasts, offenders against the law, were sold into slavery. A few persons were sold in times of famine or for debt. But the majority of slaves were apparently taken by kidnapping, raiding and wars. The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda. Accordingly, the extensive influence exercised by the Aro over Igboland through its oracle did not become an integrative force.$^{9}$ The element of violence inherent in Aro addiction to the slave trade thus distinguished their influence from the earlier ritual influ› ence of the Nri people over wide areas of Igboland.\nIn the economic sphere also, the disruption to normal agricultural activities must have been considerable. In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars.

This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

Subsequently, however, they used coercive tactics to satisfy the coastal demand. 34 Similarly, Yao itinerant traders initially exploited their access to cheap cloth and iron hoes to achieve a pre-eminent commercial position, but external pressures during the second half of the century motivated them to exert military pressure in the Shire valley in order to ensure their economic hegemony.$^{35}$ Makua participation in the slave trade underwent a parallel transformation while force had always been a component of the Arab-Swahili strategy. 36 To ensure a constant supply of captives and ivory, a number of trading groups carved out sizeable conquest states. Although differing in detail, these polities shared common characteristics that shaped their historical development. All these alien overlords relied heavily on European weapons to impose their hegemony and maintain their pre-eminence. These soph› isticated weapons were acquired in exchange for captives in an updated version of the gun-slave cycle. Once firmly entrenched, the alien ruling classes expanded the frontiers of their empire; while the amount of force varied, coercion was the dominant mechanism of incorporation. The new acquisitions provided additional sources of slaves and ivory, which were used to increase the size of their arsenals, thereby enabling further expan› sion. Although politically independent, these conquest states were an indirect, or secondary, extension of European economic and military power into the interior.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'Much the same doubts could be cast on another of the trade goods, guns.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well.

Captives from such conflicts were subsequently traded for coastal goods such as cloth. Inland peoples kept slaves for their own use. Sometimes a slave changed masters several times before reaching the coast.$^{16}$ According to Alpers, groups of slaves would pass in this manner from the interior to the coast or to one of the inland caravan centres of one of the Yao chiefs like Mponda, Makanjila and Mataka. There, they would be assembled and, in larger numbers, taken down to the coast.\nThe trading activities of the Yao, the Bisa and others who exploited the Lake Nyasa region were parallelled further north by those of the Nyamwezi, the Kamba and the Miji Kenda. Foreign goods had found their way inland into Tanzania as early as the eighteenth century through regional exchange. This development stimulated elephant-hunting for ivory to be exchanged for these foreign goods. The Sumbwa and Nyamwezi thus came to make their own contacts with the coast around 1800, travelling through Ugogo. 17 This contact led to a commercial network between Unyamwezi and the coast and the blazing of new caravan routes to link the coast and hinterland.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'The process of suppression', 'content': ""The reaction to these subterfuges was an increase in violence.

An 'equipment' clause in the treaties allowed the seizure of ships obviously equipped for the slave traffic, even though not carrying human cargoes. But the slave ships of the USA remained exempt. For forty years American diplomacy managed to evade any serious commitment.

Given the fact that 'the bigger financiers clearly had a foot in both camps' (ibid., p. 86), the resulting Parliamentary decisions might be seen as a compromise: the West Indian lobby lost on abolition but won on the East Indian tariff.

Lima died in December, 1862, leaving a large fortune acquired by the slave trade. The bulk of his money was lodged in Bahia and Lisbon, but he had a considerable sum at Vogce, and a still larger sum at Addah, where Geraldo was his agent for the purchase of slaves. On the death of his master in 1862, Geraldo took his wife, his money, and his name, and carried on the business under the name of Geraldo Vasconcellos de Lima. In 1865, Geraldo, while at Addah, ill-treated one of the principal persons of that place, and so the Addahs drove him out of the place and confiscated all his property. Geraldo fled to Ahwoonah, and raised the people there to attack the Addahs. Geraldo encamped at Aisainah, on the opposite bank of the river to Addah Fort, with a force of 3,000 to 4,000 men, and was about to cross over to attack the Addahs, when he was attacked and his forces dispersed by Captain (now Admiral) Richards, the senior naval officer of the Bights Division, with the boats of H.M.\'s ss. Dart and Lee. Geraldo had a narrow escape on the occasion. This was in April, 1865. Geraldo returned to Vogce, and raised a fresh force, and then encamped at Adedomcy, twenty miles up the Volta and opposite Melamie. He stopped the trade on the Volta, seizing canoes coming down from Crobo and Pong. Colonel Conran was then Governor, and matters became so bad that he despatched an expedition to the Volta to attack and disperse Geraldo\'s force, and, if possible, to seize his person, offering a reward for his capture. The expedition entirely failed, chiefly from the fact that the natives were not supplied with more than one round of ammunition each. Still, for all that, the Ahwoonahs suffered a terrible defeat in the open field, and Geraldo himself was severely wounded. Geraldo then sent presents to the King of Ashanti, with a request that he would send a force to help him and the Ahwoonahs to punish the Accras and their allies. In reply to this request, the King of Ashanti sent 30,000 men to subdue the Creepees and Agotims as allies of the Accras before crossing the Volta to attack the Accras and finally the Fantees. The first thing Nyanchee did when he reached Aquamoo was to seize Governor Simpson, who, however, managed to escape, came to Accra, and organized a second expedition against Geraldo, but before the natives could be moved, Governor Ussher arrived to resume his government. Ussher and Glover went with the Accras and Addahs, and after some fair work the Accras returned home without effecting the object of the expedition, namely, the capture of Geraldo. Sir Arthur Kennedy then went down to Quittah himself, and offered £200 for the capture of Geraldo, and not being able to get hold of him, ordered Captain Jones, of H.M.\'s ss.

Nor is this difficult to explain; palm-oil, which forms the principle article of trade, is collected by natives, chiefly domestic slaves, residing at or near the coast, its weight and bulk preventing it from being brought from a great distance in a country where there are no rivers; and it is evident that it would answer the chiefs better to turn their labour to account in this way than to sell them for exportation, even were not the customs of the country entirely opposed to such a proceeding. There is nothing, however, to prevent the chiefs from purchasing for export any number of the slaves captured in the hunts which are regularly undertaken for this purpose in certain parts of the interior, and so legitimate commerce and the slave-trade may be found combined in any spot on the coast to which British authority or influence does not extend.\n\nThus the existence of the British settlements, and of the Republic of Liberia, has served to eradicate the slave-trade from all but one spot on the 1,500 miles of coast extending from the Gambia to Quittah; and the recent acquisition of Lagos may be said to have freed almost entirely from the curse the remainder of the coast; the two exceptions being the small spot between the Gambia and Sierra Leone, the case of which has already been referred to in the report on the latter colony, and a portion of the sea coast lying between Quittah and Lagos, immediately in the rear of which are the dominions of the notorious King of Dahomey.\n\nIt is well known that, from the peculiar circumstances of his country, this monarch is indebted for his wealth and the maintenance of his authority over his people almost exclusively to the slave-trade. Whydah, the chief seaport of his dominions, is, as it has always been, the principal place of export; and advantage is also taken, when the vigilance of the cruisers renders it necessary, of the independent towns of Great Popo, Aghway, and Little Popo, situated to the westward, the inhabitants of which are only too ready to afford every facility for a trade from which they derive such profit.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Copy of the Report of Col.

For the sake of a few paltry hundreds a-year, this country, which is spending half-a-million annually on the naval squadron for suppressing the slave-trade, delivers over the people of an extensive region to this monster enormity. We called attention, some twelve months ago, to the active operations of the slavetraders at Quittah, since the virtual abandonment of that place by the British authorities. We stated then that many hundred slaves, from Ashantee and the Volta districts, had passed Quittah by the Lagoons and sea coast for shipment, at a place nearer to the King of Dahomey\'s port of Whydah, which our readers will see in our Dahoman news the King calls ""the English town of Whydah.""

We have by it become really implicated as a nation in that slave-trade which we are, at the same time, making such expensive efforts to suppress.

The fact is that in most parts of the extra-colonial territory a painful anarchy prevails, which Christianity alone can rectify. Every tribal dispute is made to feed the domestic slave trade.

The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment.

The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

The depressed state of trade in 1887 affected the branches of commerce upon which the colony depended; indeed, irregularity of communication has in the past given this trade a peculiarly unstable character. Placed on a firm basis, however, there would seem to be excellent prospects of a rapid development in the imports above mentioned, especially when it is considered that the market for imports from Brazil is already established in the colony of Lagos. These facts showed that it was worth while to consider the advisability of embarking upon this enterprise, and he took advantage of this opportunity to publish the facts he had put before them, which bore upon the subject, sincerely trusting that so important an opening for British trade would not be neglected. Another inducement for the establishment of steam communication between Brazil and West Africa was that the value of our possessions, in their work of development, must depend on their trade, which meant an open and settled interior. Cut them off from the interior, and they were cramped as regarded progress, and were occupied in struggling to meet the bare cost of administration; connect them with the interior and their future would be great and far-reaching. It had been questioned why West Africa had not made more progress in the march of civilisation. In the words of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton it was slavery that debarred them from acquiring industries; it was slavery which prevented them from exercising the virtues of foresight and prudence; it was slavery which left them nothing to care for; it was slavery that took away from them all the incentives to industrious labour, and debarred them from all the ties of social intercourse. When we remember the small percentage of people that represents owners, we had to acknowledge that these causes still opposed development. Time alone would rehabilitate the negro in his manliness. Obstacles that blocked progress were the altered relationship between owner and former slave, the independence of the latter when compared with his former grovelling position, doubt of result or use of independence secured with abolition, doubt in minds of native authorities of consequence of any action they might initiate, non-existence of free labour markets, and inter-tribal differences, jealousies and feuds. The removal of such blocks had been and was the aim of the Government, and they were gradually disappearing. In primitive countries such as within and adjoining our West African colonies, it was the duty of the Government to initiate the capabilities of the country represented by its products. The people were industrious in their own fashion, and were ready to follow examples set, and to develop industries once they learn to appreciate their value. We wanted new staples of trade and larger areas of demand for our wares. Agricultural products must long continue the most important part of the exports from tropical Africa, and the future development of Africa's commerce would depend upon the improvement in the quantity and quality of existing agricultural staples, and on the introduction of new products, which should serve as materials for manufacture and for use in industrial arts."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-12-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Alleged Atrocities in the Congo Free State', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A recent number of the Sierra Leone *Weekly News* stated that the men from Sierra Leone and others who have ventured into the service of the Congo Free State are suffering terribly at the hands of their employers, who illuse them, break their engagements, intercept their communications with Sierra Leone, and, in a word, use them as slaves.

Our trade with the West Coast of Africa had gone on since the time of the Tudors. For centuries that trade was in slaves, and its increase was slow; but after several blows had been struck at that trade—among others by the liberation of slaves in the West Indian Islands, in America, and in Cuba—instead of their being any injury done to our commerce, our trade with the West Coast of Africa increased by leaps and bounds. It was only in 1850 or shortly after that we attacked a great nest of slave dealers in Lagos, and in 1861 it was made a British colony. Up to that time there had been no trade there except in slaves; but last year the trade of Lagos amounted to £357,831 imports, and £538,980 exports. And yet only thirty-eight years ago that place was of absolutely no value to us for legitimate commerce. On the Gold Coast slavery had been practically abolished by the British Government, but yet there was a good deal still existing owing to the native customs of the people. Even if the export of slaves from Africa was prevented entirely, the internal trade in them would still be enormous.\n\nFormerly the slave trade was subsidiary to the ivory trade, but when porters were no longer wanted for the latter, the former remained, only the men were killed and the women and children carried away. It had been said that domestic slavery must be allowed, and that was a very difficult question to settle. In his opinion, we should, as in India, abolish the legal status of slavery, but should not rout out all the households where no complaint was made. As long as domestic slavery existed there would be a market for slaves. We must have nothing to do with slavery; while the slave trade continued it was impossible for legitimate commerce to go on as it should! If the slave trade were done away with, they would find that all other trade would flourish.\n\nIn answer to questions Commander Lovett Cameron said he had avoided speaking of the Germans for diplomatic reasons.\n\nHe had a plan for the total abolition of slavery in Africa, which he hoped to explain shortly. It was, in brief, to establish a barricade across the country by the way of the lakes, and to get authority to maintain order on that line.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, on February 26, presided over a large meeting, held in Exeter Hall, when two African explorers, Commander Cameron and Captain Hore, were announced to speak.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-03-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_03_1889#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}]",True

The articles also reveal the difficulties British officials faced in enforcing anti-slavery measures, including ineffective justice administration and complicity in the slave trade, as well as the limited success of efforts to integrate former slaves into colonial society, such as settlement and education initiatives in Sierra Leone. Additionally, they mention social issues exacerbated by colonial rule, like the detrimental impact of the drink trade on native populations.

Overall, while the text supports the claim's emphasis on the influence of slavery and African leaders, it lacks direct discussion on British anti-slavery challenges and integration of former slaves.","The African Times news articles provide several details that align with the claim regarding the complex dynamics of colonial Africa shaped by slavery, African leaders, and British officials' challenges. The articles highlight the pervasive nature of slavery, as seen in the legal and administrative measures taken by colonial powers, such as the Spanish decree to relocate captured slaves and the British efforts to suppress the slave trade in Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast. The involvement of African leaders is evident in the treaties with native chiefs, which included commitments to abolish slavery and protect trade. However, the articles also reveal the challenges faced by British officials in enforcing anti-slavery measures, such as the ineffective administration of justice in cases of slave dealing and the complicity of some officials in the slave trade. Additionally, the integration of former slaves into colonial society is touched upon, with references to the settlement and education efforts in Sierra Leone, although these efforts are critiqued for their limited success. The articles also mention the social issues exacerbated by colonial rule, such as the detrimental impact of the drink trade on native populations.

Plantation slavery emerged, either in the form of slave settlements in the rural areas managed according to customary law on the Guinea coast, or Islamic law in the Muslim areas, or approximating to American-type plantations in the Indian Ocean islands. With the increased use of people of slave origin as warriors and in administrative positions at various courts, it has been estimated that in many parts of Africa slave populations could range between 25 and 50 per cent of the total population.$^{19}$ Although there were examples of slave revolts, and the particular example of the Lozi who threw off their Kololo overlords,$^{20}$ generally the slave populations did not form a distinct class. The bulk performed menial jobs, largely as agricultural labourers. However the substantial groups of warriors and domestic slaves, and the significant few who rose to positions of trust and power as successful warriors, traders or administrators, and the variations in their fortunes and life styles, made combination as a class of slaves very difficult. Only in places like Old Calabar, where the slaves were permanently alienated, with little inclination to integrate them culturally, and with a tradition of competition among the ruling elite to show off wealth by the number of slaves killed in funeral ceremonies,$^{21}$ did the slaves in the agricultural villages combine in a secret cult to demand improved conditions. Elsewhere, the prevalent ethos was acculturation and integration into the society through individual households. While the degree of integration was clearly limited - as witnessed by the number anxious to be redeemed or, having been emancipated by colonial laws, who were anxious to return to their original homes - it was real enough to suggest that the dynamics of change in most of the African communities was the tension of age and sex within each household, and of status and competition for power between the lineages and kinship groups, rather than between broad classes in society.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.726, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""The difficulty was that subsistence farmers had few needs and often felt that regular employment savoured of slavery$^{5 6}$ and that these tasks were women's work.$^{57}$ Europeans, frustrated by seeing large profits slipping away from them, had little sympathy with such attitudes: 'fear had to take the place of ambition or covetousness as the motive sentiment inducing them to labour'.$^{58}$ The solutions were primitive and often brutal. For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.722, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': ""This difference in time factor is important in any attempt to account for the differential impact of the forces of change on the different regions and countries of Africa. That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence.

The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Political structures', 'content': ""This effort at self-development was perhaps most prominent in the realm of political structures and state power. The grand lesson of the slave trade era long driven home in West and Central Africa, and being learnt in East Africa in the course of the nineteenth century, was that the way to survive and perhaps even profit from the slave trade was to strengthen the structures and military basis of state power.\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, as we have noted in most parts of Africa, 'the political and economic structures ... seemed to have a certain fragility about them. There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority. In the words of K. Arhin and J. Ki-Zerbo describing the Voltaic regions: During the nineteenth century, political instability and population movements were widespread. Brutal massacres and secessionist move› ments were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority... Some notable exceptions notwithstanding, the frequency and extent of these conflicts grew and the tendency towards social dislocation was undoubtedly linked with the growing opportunities available to the peripheral powers and the rebels to obtain arms and use them to challenge the reigning chiefs. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust.

The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin.

Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system.

Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change.

It was inconceivable, for example, that an African, either as a slave or a freed man, would be accepted into the kinship system of his owner. Africans were 'maintained as separate ethnic groups that reproduced themselves either by natural processes or by constant recruitments'. Formidable social barriers were erected to prevent them entering the mainstream of society.

If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind.

First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape. These provided good stepping stones for the forces of western education, western Christianity and western commerce to penetrate the interior.

There was a settlement there before the British Government commenced its crusade against the traffic in human beings, but the population was very small, and the colony had a precarious existence until it was placed under the control of the African Institution, an organization established for the improvement of the western part of Africa. This body, which had the support of all the great men engaged in the anti-slavery movement in England, directed its efforts to the amelioration of the condition of the freed slaves, and did in its time an immense amount of good. Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, was made the head-quarters of the association on the coast, and the captured slaves were landed and settled there. An idea of the extent to which this kind of colonization was carried may be gathered from the fact that the total number of slaves emancipated at Sierra Leone between June, 1819, and January, 1833, was 27,697. The exertions of the association were not merely directed to the settlement of the slaves. A system of education was inaugurated, and the settlers were trained in useful arts. The funds of the association were not always well employed, but the general result of their operations is highly satisfactory, and such as to reflect high honour upon the benevolence of the English people. Sierra Leone is now a flourishing colony, and its inhabitants are further advanced on the paths of civilization than, perhaps, any other body of Africans. Education is widely diffused amongst the community, and many of the higher classes have obtained academic distinction in England, and risen to positions of eminence in their own country. In every walk of life, descendants of emancipated slaves are distinguishing themselves, and justifying the confidence of those who believe in the possibility of the civilization of the negro race.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1888#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Report of the Commissioner appointed to Inquire into the Condition of the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have numerous treaties with the natives, beginning from 1826; they relate, in some instances, to cessions of territory, and always contain engagements for the protection of trade, the abolition of slavery, and the preservation of peace.

Lagos has for many years had a large trade carried on by British and other European merchants, yet this did not prevent it from being at the same time the head-quarters of slavery in the Bights. At Whydah an extensive trade in palm-oil has existed since 1849, and yet slaves have been regularly shipped from that port up to the present day, and, as has been already stated, a cargo was awaiting embarkation there in December last. Nor is this difficult to explain; palm-oil, which forms the principle article of trade, is collected by natives, chiefly domestic slaves, residing at or near the coast, its weight and bulk preventing it from being brought from a great distance in a country where there are no rivers; and it is evident that it would answer the chiefs better to turn their labour to account in this way than to sell them for exportation, even were not the customs of the country entirely opposed to such a proceeding. There is nothing, however, to prevent the chiefs from purchasing for export any number of the slaves captured in the hunts which are regularly undertaken for this purpose in certain parts of the interior, and so legitimate commerce and the slave-trade may be found combined in any spot on the coast to which British authority or influence does not extend.\n\nThus the existence of the British settlements, and of the Republic of Liberia, has served to eradicate the slave-trade from all but one spot on the 1,500 miles of coast extending from the Gambia to Quittah; and the recent acquisition of Lagos may be said to have freed almost entirely from the curse the remainder of the coast; the two exceptions being the small spot between the Gambia and Sierra Leone, the case of which has already been referred to in the report on the latter colony, and a portion of the sea coast lying between Quittah and Lagos, immediately in the rear of which are the dominions of the notorious King of Dahomey.\n\nIt is well known that, from the peculiar circumstances of his country, this monarch is indebted for his wealth and the maintenance of his authority over his people almost exclusively to the slave-trade. Whydah, the chief seaport of his dominions, is, as it has always been, the principal place of export; and advantage is also taken, when the vigilance of the cruisers renders it necessary, of the independent towns of Great Popo, Aghway, and Little Popo, situated to the westward, the inhabitants of which are only too ready to afford every facility for a trade from which they derive such profit.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The very air of Africa reeks with rum and gin imported by us, every hut is redolent of its fumes.

The depositions of the witnesses, which are now for the first time published in this country, show that indescribable cruelties were committed by these ruffians and their accomplices, among whom, it will be remembered, was the wife of Williams. Two slave girls were subjected to frightful brutalities, although fortunately only one died. They were tied back to back and severely flogged by the man John, and by Mrs. Williams. Then a troop of school children were actually sent for to continue the flogging, and many of the boys, it appears, supplied themselves with sticks from a guava tree, and shamefully beat the poor girls in the presence of the ex-missionaries and their wives.

The prosecution was beset with difficulties, owing to the fact that the outrages were committed in districts beyond British jurisdiction.

The chief object of the officers is to get rubber and ivory at any price rather than to civilise, and they make no scruples in setting one tribe against another, using the stronger as a catspaw to obtain the ivory from the weaker. Great loss of life is the result, and it is no wonder we hear at intervals of officers being massacred. In addition to the ivory in the Native villages, the river is closely watched. A canoe laden with ivory is seen coming down the river in the evening, and signals are made for the Natives to stop and bring in their goods on the usual terms—that is to say, at a much lower price than could be obtained from any independent trader. Of course, the Natives paddle away as fast as possible, whereupon they are at once fired on and either killed or compelled to bring in their ivory. Another serious matter—one which is attracting the attention of the British Government—is the wholesale recruiting by Belgian agents of British subjects in Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and Barbadoes. Although, as the result of representations made to the Colonial Governments concerned this is being gradually suppressed, at one time almost every ship brought a number of men who had entered into contracts with the State to act as labourers. Once in the Congo the word ""travailleur"" was erased, and ""soldat"" substituted. Comparatively few of these people ever return to the coast. They die in the interior, usually of starvation. The result of all this is that hundreds of miles of the country are desolate, and that the Natives are leaving for the French sphere.\n\nIt is only fair to say that the high officials on the coast are not wholly responsible for this, and that some slight attempt is made at Boma, for instance, to educate the children, and so forth. The interior is in a constant state of siege, and legitimate trade is stagnated. There can be no doubt that had the Congo people the power of cohesion, the Belgians would have long since been swept out of the country, and that the British and other foreigners, who are all classed as whites, would have shared a similar fate.

Lovett Cameron, R.N., on ""Africa.""\n\nThe lecturer said that the further British influence extended in Africa the more would slavery of every kind be done away with. Besides illegal slavery, there was extensively practised in Africa a system of native despotism which it was very desirable should be abolished. In 1876 nobody seemed to take any notice of Africa, and the exportation of India-rubber from Zanzibar amounted to something under £20,000. Now the amount was about £250,000! With respect to ill-health in that continent, he had found that some of the native treatments were by no means to be despised, and many of our English doctors could take a leaf out of their book. The record of men who had travelled through Africa and endured every conceivable kind of hardship proved that Africa had been cursed by the idea of its unhealthiness, a reproach which it did not deserve. The great thing required, however, was adequate communication. African travelling, under present circumstances, meant, at the outside, fifty miles in a week. At the present time every mile of railroad laid down in Africa drove a dozen nails into the coffin of the slave-trade, to say nothing of the immense impetus to trade and commerce which would thus be afforded. From Cairo right away to the Albert Nyanza was navigable water. There would be no difficulty in overcoming the obstacles of cataracts, &c., which modern engineering would easily surmount. The central high plateau of Africa was, to a great extent, in British hands, and offered the most important means of repressing the slave-trade in future. Every slave working at the present time was in direct defiance of the Act of 1873. Mr. Rhodes\' great railway, which would reach Zambesia within eight years, should be kept under British control, as native treaties were more or less uncertain. In 1876 they could have obtained all that is now German territory by holding up their hands. The Germans, however, are practically locked in. A dispute had been going on with Portugal as to whether the Zambesi was an open highway. Fortunately, owing to the twenty-one miles strip of land granted by England to Germany these two powers would be as one on the question, and in future arbitration claim the Zambesi as an open highway. A wise system of emigration should be conducted. He would like to see Indian planters transferred there, and Chinese too. Africa offered an excellent opening for the English working man, and it was desirable that the Government should protect its emigrants. The dangers of Africa were largely dwelt on nowadays, and its advantages were put in the rear. This was the reason why the development of that great continent was so far behind hand.\n\nThe following resolution was proposed by Admiral Field, M.P., seconded by Mr. Johnson (of the Stanley Falls, Congo):—', 'last_edit_date': '1890-07-18', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1890#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH MISRULE IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Under this heading there has lately appeared in the London Daily Graphic a series of illustrated articles, tending to show how demoralizing to the Native mind is much that arises from the present system of British rule and influence in this part of the world. It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

The great future wealth of the interior plateaux will certainly lie in their mineral deposits, the riches of the West Coast region lie in its numerous and valuable vegetable products, of which the most striking are palm oil, and ground nuts, benniseed, shea butter, rubber, gums, spices, cotton, dyes, and valuable timbers, among which ebony occupies a prominent place. With regard to animal products, I might mention ivory and monkey skins. Whereas some of the great races of the interior speak languages which connect them with the Hamitic and Semitic families. The native inhabitants of the West Coast are all that there is of most typically Negro in character; yet I do not mean they are races of particularly low development; on the contrary, the typical Negro is a fine specimen of man, and is by no means as low in his mental state as the races of Polynesia and America. I may cite the Kru tribes of that portion of West Africa which is known as Liberia, a country inhabited by an industrious, energetic, hardworking, stalwart population of free men. An element of heterogeneous ex-slave settlers among the tribes of the coast may be found in some parts of the Colonies of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos. These people represent the Nemesis which invariably follows national crimes. We and our American children indulged to a greater extent than any other European nation in the African slave trade, and, as our wrong-doing was violent and exaggerated, so to a certain extent was the abrupt reparation which followed. Although I would not minimise the work done by our blockade on the West Coast, the abolition of the slave trade was more effectually brought about by the abolition of slavery in the United States of America. One result of our suppression of the slave trade in West Africa has not been altogether advantageous. I refer to the Slave Colonies established at Sierra Leone, and at Fernando Po and other points on the coast. It may be taken that the slaves exported from any district are the least worthy people in it, and the result is that a large proportion of this population is descended from the sweepings of West Africa, and has not yet passed through sufficient generations to eliminate the ancestral badness of its progenitors. So, although here and there a negro has shown what the race can attain to under favourable circumstances, still the bulk of the ""S\'a Leone"" people who are scattered up and down the coast are of an undesirable character, and the cause of indiscriminating blame on the part of superficial observers which is most unjustly laid on the shoulders of the entire population of West Africa; whereas many of these races are superior in intelligence, enterprise, and integrity to any of our negro fellow-subjects in South Africa or the West Indies. What admirable recruits to civilised society can be obtained from many of these people may be instanced by such men as Bishop Crowther, Archdeacons Johnson and Crowther, Samuel Lewis, and other divines and lawyers and officials in West Africa, who are on a par with well-educated white men, and in some cases superior in intelligence and acquirements to the whites with whom they come in contact. It is absurd, however, to regard the Negro race, as a whole, on the same average level as the European—they are far below us. Take them in their native wilds, and they are what we were before Julius Caesar landed in this country; indeed, in many cases they are not 2,000 years behind us, but 10,000. They are in the condition of some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and Gaul, and Spain, whose history we can dimly spell out from their implements and scattered remains, who were undoubtedly cannibals and probably naked, and leading a brutish life. Yet we can in a few years drag them from the condition that prevailed 2,000 years before Christ into the year of grace 1889. We can take a cannibal from the Upper Cross River, and transport him to the centres of civilisation in England or America, where everything represents the utmost result of our present development; but what will be usually the result both with the individual and the race? The savage mind will be unable to grasp and assimilate one-third of the wonders presented to his consideration, and will probably even suffer from the shock. We cannot expect the negroes of West Africa to become all at once intelligent, self-governing people. For many years the white races must be their guardians and educators, and we must educate the negro by force if necessary, leaving him to understand us afterwards, when we have raised him to a condition to do so. This, then, is our mission in West Africa: to instruct the natives that idleness is the eighth deadly sin; next, to so instruct the native as to the existence of the resources of this country; and, lastly, to educate him in the principles of civilised society, and so assimilate his views with our own that he and we may be bound together with the ties of commerce and Empire.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SLAVERY AND THE SLAVE-TRADE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""It would be impossible to give more than the barest outline of the efforts of England in Central Africa, unhappily at present so little crowned with success.

Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area.

Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash.

For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': ""On the eve of the 'Scramble'"", 'content': ""lend itself to a unified struggle against the Europeans.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion.

When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence.

Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts.

Workers never received a living wage or any social benefits because they were part-time farmers, and throughout their working lives other members of their family remained self-supporting at the stagnant level which Europeans considered to be African subsistence. In the same way, cash crops which went into the local or export markets were generated as a surplus over and above peasant subsistence. For these reasons, it is misleading to conceptualize the colony as a 'dual economy' with distinct 'modern' and 'traditional' sectors.$^{12}$ The supposedly dynamic modern enclave and the backward traditional forms were dialectically interrelated and interdependent.

In order that this affair may be quite understood, we may state that the celebrated slave clipper steamer Ciceron landed a cargo of slaves in Cuba, from Dahomey, of from 1,200 to 1,300 individuals. They were landed in the district over which Mr. Arguelles exercised authority as lieutenant-governor. Arguelles captured the whole cargo, and with them Senor Zulueta and other powerful individuals who are engaged as capitalists in the nefarious traffic. These persons, although caught ""in flagrante,"" although taken in the very act, have proved themselves to be sufficiently powerful to free themselves from all condemnation and to obtain the ruin of the man who had interfered with their unholy gains. There was a difference between the number of slaves seized and the number surrendered to the supreme authorities of the island. Zulueta and his worthy companions denounced Arguelles to the captain-general as having sold that number of slaves which constituted the difference alluded to. Arguelles maintains that the negroes thus deficient in the surrender were given by him to the parties to whom he is represented as having sold them—given by him for the aid and assistance rendered by those persons in effecting the capture, and as a price indeed agreed to be paid to them for that assistance. And considering the slave-trade morality of the island, this cannot be considered impossible. But as Zulueta and his brother slave-trade capitalists denounced Arguelles, so the persons who had thus received the slaves from Arguelles swore that they did not receive them as a gift, but that they paid from 700* to 750 dollars each for them, while Arguelles maintains that the only crime of which he has been guilty was in so far exceeding his instructions and the intentions of the chief authority, as to have captured such powerful people, such mighty slavetraders, as Zulueta and his friends. And we must say that the impunity which these people enjoy, although they were thus taken in the very act of having superintended the landing of the cargo, &c., of which they were proprietors, leads very strongly to the supposition, by those who know something of the purity of Spanish administration and of Spanish local law courts in such matters, that Arguelles may after all not be the guilty person he has been stated to be, and has been condemned as being. He is now a convict in the slave gang, while Zulueta and his friends are at liberty to arrange for retrieving the loss Arguelles inflicted on them in capturing an otherwise safely-landed cargo of 1,200 slaves, worth to them one million of dollars, or 200,000l.—to arrange for retrieving this by importing other cargoes in the Ciceron from Dahomey.'}, {'id': 410, 'article_title': 'SLAVE TRADE—CUBA', 'full_section_title': 'SLAVE TRADE—CUBA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1864#article-21', 'issue_date': '23_07_1864', 'content': 'In the following important State paper there are phrases which give the impression that Mr. Savage was not entirely satisfied of the guilt of Arguelles; not entirely satisfied that all the testimony brought against him was true.

The Tide Surveyor examined the manifest, and, among other items of cargo, saw a large quantity of shingles. These he knew were in great request in the town, as the rainy season was setting in, and the roofs of the houses of many people required repairing. He asked the supercargo, Captain Ryder, his price for the shingles, was told, and then purchased the lot, 55,000, thus being enabled to rule the market, as no one else had shingles in Bathurst. The vessel was duly entered, and the shingles landed by this Customs official, and he resold about 25,000 to the Engineer Department, and disposed of the balance, 30,000, in small lots, at a good profit, to various people in the town, who had to purchase them at any price, as the roofs of their houses leaked. Now, is it a fair thing that officials, whose salaries amount to hundreds per annum, should be free to compete with and injure the shopkeepers of Bathurst?\n\nIt has been a common thing for all kinds of provisions, clothing, also liquors, cigars, &c., to be purchased on board of the mail steamers by officials from the Custom House, brought on shore in the Customs' boat, taken up to the houses of the officials by the Customs' boat's crew, and what was not wanted for the use of the purchasing official, retailed to the people in the town, much under the price such articles could be sold at in the shops at a profit. Business here is very dull; the shops are just turning over the capital, and perhaps paying expenses, the shopkeepers making just a bare living. Is it right that such living should be further reduced by the private trade of officials?\n\nThe best remedy would be for the Colonial Office to send out instructions to the Administrator here to make all present and future officials subscribe to a declaration, setting forth that they are not, or will not be engaged in any trade, calling, or occupation, outside the sphere of their official duty, and that they do not, and will not, hire or engage anyone to carry on any such trade, calling or occupation on their sole or for joint behalf.\n\nWhat with officials of the Courts practising as attorneys, Customs and other officials trading, things here are in a far from satisfactory state.—I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,"", 'last_edit_date': '1881-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1881#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Culpable Mismanagement at the Gambia', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—In your issue of 1st inst. you publish a letter about trading by Government officials, and mention ""Sergeant-Major Paul.""

Long files of camels are laden with provisions, two thousand armed men serve as an escort, and the human flock altogether counts four thousand heads.

The depositions of the witnesses, which are now for the first time published in this country, show that indescribable cruelties were committed by these ruffians and their accomplices, among whom, it will be remembered, was the wife of Williams. Two slave girls were subjected to frightful brutalities, although fortunately only one died. They were tied back to back and severely flogged by the man John, and by Mrs. Williams. Then a troop of school children were actually sent for to continue the flogging, and many of the boys, it appears, supplied themselves with sticks from a guava tree, and shamefully beat the poor girls in the presence of the ex-missionaries and their wives. Subsequently they were cruelly tortured with cayenne pepper; one of them—Amé by name—dying in the course of the night, a bottle of rum being given to the man who buried her to bribe him not to tell what had happened. The culprits richly merited the severe sentences which were ultimately passed upon them; but many readers of the Correspondence will be disposed to think that it was a case which called for the infliction of the extreme penalty of the law, at all events against two of the offenders.

The Earl of Dundonald was in the chair.\n\nCommander Lovett Cameron, in the course of his opening remarks, said the slave trade went on all round the continent of Africa, and commerce had gone on with it. Our trade with the West Coast of Africa had gone on since the time of the Tudors. For centuries that trade was in slaves, and its increase was slow; but after several blows had been struck at that trade—among others by the liberation of slaves in the West Indian Islands, in America, and in Cuba—instead of their being any injury done to our commerce, our trade with the West Coast of Africa increased by leaps and bounds. It was only in 1850 or shortly after that we attacked a great nest of slave dealers in Lagos, and in 1861 it was made a British colony. Up to that time there had been no trade there except in slaves; but last year the trade of Lagos amounted to £357,831 imports, and £538,980 exports. And yet only thirty-eight years ago that place was of absolutely no value to us for legitimate commerce. On the Gold Coast slavery had been practically abolished by the British Government, but yet there was a good deal still existing owing to the native customs of the people. Even if the export of slaves from Africa was prevented entirely, the internal trade in them would still be enormous.\n\nFormerly the slave trade was subsidiary to the ivory trade, but when porters were no longer wanted for the latter, the former remained, only the men were killed and the women and children carried away. It had been said that domestic slavery must be allowed, and that was a very difficult question to settle. In his opinion, we should, as in India, abolish the legal status of slavery, but should not rout out all the households where no complaint was made. As long as domestic slavery existed there would be a market for slaves. We must have nothing to do with slavery; while the slave trade continued it was impossible for legitimate commerce to go on as it should! If the slave trade were done away with, they would find that all other trade would flourish.\n\nIn answer to questions Commander Lovett Cameron said he had avoided speaking of the Germans for diplomatic reasons.\n\nHe had a plan for the total abolition of slavery in Africa, which he hoped to explain shortly. It was, in brief, to establish a barricade across the country by the way of the lakes, and to get authority to maintain order on that line.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, on February 26, presided over a large meeting, held in Exeter Hall, when two African explorers, Commander Cameron and Captain Hore, were announced to speak.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-03-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_03_1889#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MR.

The answer is obvious if one bears in mind the nature of the expanding plantation economy in Zanzibar and Pemba. Its dependence on slave labour meant that restriction on the procurement of slaves would limit its growth. It is known that plantation agriculture continued to expand after the decree of 1873.$^{49}$ As slave-trading was still legal on the mainland coast, traders were able to transport slaves a long distance along the coast between Kilwa and Mombasa or even Malindi and smuggle them to Zanzibar, and especially Pemba, in small vessels at night in order to avoid the British naval patrol. Even after the slave trade was prohibited on the mainland in 1876, neither the sultan nor the British were in a position to enforce the decree effectively. The clove plantations on the islands had increased demand for food production on the mainland coast, especially grain. Thus, a number of plantations producing grain with slave labour had sprung up all along the coast between Pangani and Malindi. It was therefore impossible during this time to distinguish slaves intended for sale from those intended for use on these plantations.$^{50}$ To make things worse, this was the time when internal strife in many parts of the hinterland was producing large numbers of captives. The traders could easily invent new ways of evading the sultan's soldiers and the British naval patrol. A number of new concealed stations sprang up all along the coast between Pangani and Mombasa, from which small dhows could slip off at night and reach Pemba unnoticed. It is therefore clear that the slave trade remained a major activity well into the colonial period.\nThe European trade missions and the naval patrol against slave traders were limited to Zanzibar and the coastal areas. Although Europeans could no doubt obtain from Arab traders a few stories about places far away from the coast, the vast hinterland remained unknown to them. Gradually, however, events were to turn the attention of the humanitarians and the evangelicals to East Africa. Until 1856 their main interest was still focused on the trans-Atlantic trade. But as more became known about the horrors of the East African slave trade, European public attention was more and more drawn to the region."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic tensions > Production and trade', 'content': ""The abolition of the slave trade by Britain in 1807 introduced an element of structural imbalance into this situation, especially in the south, where surveillance was instituted earliest and maintained most strictly, although domestic slavery was tolerated.$^{48}$ During the second half of the nineteenth century slavery expanded very substantially, especially in the Niger bend.

The main sources of supply, however, were not only the great djihäd conducted by the Muslim leaders of the north and the conflicts in Mossi territory.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858. But local opposition to the Baptists continued to be high, especially as many of the Anglo-West Indian settlers at Victoria also traded in competition with the Bimbia population."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Niger delta > The Igbo hinterland', 'content': 'The predominantly disruptive character of the slave trade may be shown in different ways. First, the manner in which slaves were procured tended to destroy social and political structures. Social outcasts, offenders against the law, were sold into slavery. A few persons were sold in times of famine or for debt. But the majority of slaves were apparently taken by kidnapping, raiding and wars. The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda. Accordingly, the extensive influence exercised by the Aro over Igboland through its oracle did not become an integrative force.$^{9}$ The element of violence inherent in Aro addiction to the slave trade thus distinguished their influence from the earlier ritual influ› ence of the Nri people over wide areas of Igboland.\nIn the economic sphere also, the disruption to normal agricultural activities must have been considerable. In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars. The metal bars were turned into pewters, ritual bells, state swords, leg-rings, and other ornaments.

At the Congress of Vienna, British diplomacy sought an explicit condemnation of the trade, but all it obtained was an empty, procrastinatory declaration, reaffirmed at Verona. From 1841, this pretence of official abolitionist morality gave the British Foreign Office and the Admiralty all the authority they needed for their combined strategies in regard to the international slave trade. This was a radical three-point plan of action: domestic legislation making it illegal for nationals of the country concerned to engage in the traffic; bilateral treaties giving navies the reciprocal right to search and seize at sea merchant vessels of either contracting nation caught in the illegal trade; and collaboration through mixed commissions, empowered to adjudicate on captured slave ships and set free the slaves found on board.

If they were less farsighted, less fortunate or less well-advised, they would see their traditional enemies siding with the invader and would themselves assume an attitude of resistance, which could all too easily end in military defeat, the deposition of chiefs, the loss of land to the native allies of the occupying power, possibly even to the political fragmen› tation of the society or state ...

Given the fact that 'the bigger financiers clearly had a foot in both camps' (ibid., p. 86), the resulting Parliamentary decisions might be seen as a compromise: the West Indian lobby lost on abolition but won on the East Indian tariff.

This trade, once inaugurated, was carried on by the Egyptians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and Europeans down to the end of the last century, when the revival of human feeling urged certain philanthropists in England to move towards the abolition of a great evil. But during all this period the negro himself was as much to blame as the white and yellow men; indeed, it was probable that negroes were enslaving negroes long before Egyptian or Arab bought black servants from the negro chiefs, and at the present day there would be no slavery in Africa if an approval of slavery were not present in the philosophy of the negro tribes of Africa. Slavery and the slave trade, with the tribal wars and their attendant insecurity, had been the cause of Africa's backward condition, and if ever that Continent were to be raised to the civilisation of Europe, slavery and the slave trade must be extirpated. The two great slave markets which, until a few years ago, had existed in America, and in Turkey and Persia rendered the inducements to slave traders so great that the guarding of the coasts of Africa by British cruisers only checked the trade in a very slight degree; and even now many slaves were sent to Arabia, Persia, and Madagascar. In the present day, however, Africa was the main consumer of its own slaves. The most remarkable revival of the slave trade and occurred in German East Africa. The Germans, under Major Von Wissmann, began by suppressing a revolt of the Arab slave dealers, which led to the almost complete extinction of the oversea slave traffic on the German coast of East Africa; but the organisation of a strong government led to the rapid settling down of the Arabs as great landed proprietors, with an unlimited number of slaves to work their plantations. Legally slavery could not exist in German territory, but in such a wide and sparsely populated region it was impossible to prevent it in fact; and as the slaves were ordinarily well and kindly treated, it never occurred to them to want to leave their masters or to better their condition. It might be asked where, then, was the harm of slavery? The harm lay in this, that slavery commenced with an initial evil. The speaker then drew a picture of the loss of life, devastation of countries, and breaking of family ties which attended a capture of slaves. This depopulation of whole regions was attended with another evil, the return of the dreaded tsetse fly; and the surest way of extirpating this pest was to encourage population in the fertile districts of Central Africa.

Why, if England be really in earnest, is the country where we have had a footing for so long, left, while openings are being sought elsewhere? No one can object to an effort to stop slavery on the Congo and the Nile, but this place should have first attention. It must be admitted that we have already induced all the native chiefs to agree to put an end to slavery, but they do not carry out their agreements, and we do not attempt to compel them. To do so would be a very easy task, for which no five thousand pounds a year would be wanted, and little or no force, but a great deal of firmness. If the Governor, Sir Samuel Rowe, were consulted by the Home Government on the point, he would soon show how this may be accomplished, and then in course of time slavery would cease in the adjoining countries, and they, in their turn, would become a vantage ground for attacking it in the farther interior, and so the task set a hundred years ago, but never yet accomplished, would be completely fulfilled.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1885#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The very air of Africa reeks with rum and gin imported by us, every hut is redolent of its fumes.

It is true that the export in this locality is almost, although not entirely, kept under by the vigilance of the squadron, but this is only effected by keeping a number of men-of-war (there were six in December last) anchored within two miles of the coast, at short distances from each other, with armed boats in the intervals; an arrangement entailing the severest and most trying duties on the officers and men employed, and attaining its partial success only at very great cost to the country.\n\nIf the present trade of the settlements be compared with that of any other British possessions, it is not certainly of any great moment; but, such as it is, it owes its continuance mainly to the encouragement and protection which their presence affords it. Their exports in 1863 (the latest for which complete returns can be obtained) amounted to within a trifle of 650,000l., whilst their imports for the same period reached 533,000l.\n\nThe mode in which the trade is carried on has been already alluded to in the former part of the report, and it will be readily understood that a commerce, which is conducted chiefly by native agents, and to a great extent in countries inhabited by savage and lawless tribes, at considerable distances from the settlements, can only be prosecuted in safety when their influence is felt and their authority respected; indeed, notwithstanding the comparative security afforded to trade, local interruptions of it are but too numerous, and the difficulties which have arisen between the natives and ourselves have, in many instances, had their origin in robberies and assaults committed by them on our traders and their servants, so that the merchants are probably not in error in asserting that the complete annihilation of their trade would in most cases follow the withdrawal of the protection they now enjoy.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE SLAVE-TRADE IN THE VOLTA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The intelligence we publish in this present number, of the lamentable extent to which this infamous traffic is carried on within and from the protected territories of the Gold Coast, will greatly afflict and surprise our friends.

For the sake of a few paltry hundreds a-year, this country, which is spending half-a-million annually on the naval squadron for suppressing the slave-trade, delivers over the people of an extensive region to this monster enormity. We called attention, some twelve months ago, to the active operations of the slavetraders at Quittah, since the virtual abandonment of that place by the British authorities. We stated then that many hundred slaves, from Ashantee and the Volta districts, had passed Quittah by the Lagoons and sea coast for shipment, at a place nearer to the King of Dahomey\'s port of Whydah, which our readers will see in our Dahoman news the King calls ""the English town of Whydah.""

Before we had anything to do directly with the government of India, or any colonies in Africa, there was an immense trade, and healthy and vigorous, which had been going on for ages between East Africa and India. The early navigators tell that they found there considerable freedom, a certain amount of civilisation, and a very large amount of trade with India. A century after that the country had been for the greater part occupied by the Portuguese, in some part by Englishmen, and its commerce and prosperity had declined. Something had been done since then to revive a legitimate trade there, and there was a very considerable trade with other countries in Europe. That trade was capable of enormous development. The unhealthy districts were all on the coast. The interior was well-watered and healthy, and yet the inhabitants had been swept from it within living memory by the slave trade. Large regions had been depopulated, and that was the state in which it was now found. It was since we made ourselves masters of the Indian seas that the slave trade had grown to its present dimensions. It must now be put down. The meeting would, therefore, respectfully urge upon Her Majesty's Government to take steps for the prompt abrogation of those treaties, and to carry out in other respects the recommendations embodied in the report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons to secure an entire abolition of the slave trade in Eastern Africa.\n\nSir Thomas Buxton, who seconded the resolution, said the slave trade papers had from year to year contained a mass of information on the subject, furnished by captains and others, which left no doubt that a tremendous evil was going on; but at present there was little excuse for the ignorance that existed on the subject. Zanzibar was the port through which the trade was carried on. In many cases we had treated the native states of Zanzibar very much in the way we treated the native states of India. We had interfered in their political affairs and their internal arrangements. That and other circumstances showed we had a certain authority in that port and in the islands about it, and if that evil of the slave trade continued, the world would hold us responsible for it in a great degree."", 'last_edit_date': '1872-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1872#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

Lagos has for many years had a large trade carried on by British and other European merchants, yet this did not prevent it from being at the same time the head-quarters of slavery in the Bights. At Whydah an extensive trade in palm-oil has existed since 1849, and yet slaves have been regularly shipped from that port up to the present day, and, as has been already stated, a cargo was awaiting embarkation there in December last. Nor is this difficult to explain; palm-oil, which forms the principle article of trade, is collected by natives, chiefly domestic slaves, residing at or near the coast, its weight and bulk preventing it from being brought from a great distance in a country where there are no rivers; and it is evident that it would answer the chiefs better to turn their labour to account in this way than to sell them for exportation, even were not the customs of the country entirely opposed to such a proceeding. There is nothing, however, to prevent the chiefs from purchasing for export any number of the slaves captured in the hunts which are regularly undertaken for this purpose in certain parts of the interior, and so legitimate commerce and the slave-trade may be found combined in any spot on the coast to which British authority or influence does not extend.\n\nThus the existence of the British settlements, and of the Republic of Liberia, has served to eradicate the slave-trade from all but one spot on the 1,500 miles of coast extending from the Gambia to Quittah; and the recent acquisition of Lagos may be said to have freed almost entirely from the curse the remainder of the coast; the two exceptions being the small spot between the Gambia and Sierra Leone, the case of which has already been referred to in the report on the latter colony, and a portion of the sea coast lying between Quittah and Lagos, immediately in the rear of which are the dominions of the notorious King of Dahomey.\n\nIt is well known that, from the peculiar circumstances of his country, this monarch is indebted for his wealth and the maintenance of his authority over his people almost exclusively to the slave-trade. Whydah, the chief seaport of his dominions, is, as it has always been, the principal place of export; and advantage is also taken, when the vigilance of the cruisers renders it necessary, of the independent towns of Great Popo, Aghway, and Little Popo, situated to the westward, the inhabitants of which are only too ready to afford every facility for a trade from which they derive such profit.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sale of Slaves—Why is there not a British Commandant at Quittah?', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It is known that certain tribes on this side of the coast of Africa who are not British subjects, and not directly under British protection, are privileged to buy what they call ""domestic slaves,"" but I never heard of a similar privilege being conferred on any bona fide British subject, and under Her Majesty\'s immediate protection; yet it is plain that British subjects who, having lived here for a long time, exercise pecuniary influence over the natives, do buy and retain a lot of ""domestic slaves;"" and I often heard such anyone express dissatisfaction that the Government should come here to humbug the people, as they call it. I own that there are advantages which we of course derive in point of trade, and I believe we have more rum and tobacco come to this port, more than what goes to the four settlements put together, especially of late, and we land our rum and other things here free of duty; but, notwithstanding all these advantages, I do not agree with anyone who expresses a wish that the Government should not interfere with the people.\n\nQuittah at present is not what it was in years gone by, and whoever feels an interest about the matter must certainly put up with it anyhow, and should begin to prepare themselves for the change.\n\nThis time they should see that there are Europeans and others from the different settlements who reside here carrying on extensive mercantile business, and shipping large quantities of produce by steamers regularly; besides, vessels from different ports of Europe frequent here, trading. The Lagoon from the River Volta is navigable to all these parts, and continues its course all the way down to Lagos, and surely the English Government should not leave us unprotected.

This island of Pemba lies 30 miles north of Zanzibar. The coast of Africa is separated from it by a channel of 50 miles\' width. A dead flat, the island is turned to account by a few Arab tenants who hold their lands of the Sultan of Zanzibar and cultivate cloves with more or less success. As a rule, they are in the hands of Parsee money-lenders, and are mulcted by duties of 50 per cent. to 60 per cent. on the exports of their cloves. But the trade continues, because it is possible to import numbers of slaves who are worked to death at a rate unknown on the mainland.\n\nThe duty of acting as ""preventive men"" devolves upon the officers and crews of the British men-of-war stationed upon the East Coast. The coast opposite Pemba is all that the slave trader can desire. Serrated with creeks in which dhows can load up for the run across, it is impossible to frustrate the embarkation of slaves; a high tide and a fair wind together with a dark night, make it 100 to 1 in favour of the venture. The island is reached before dawn, the slaves are hurried inland, and are at once concealed. The deaths of Captain Brownrigg and Lieut. Cooper ought to open the eyes of all concerned to the anomalies of the Pemba slave trade; the first to come to his senses should be the British taxpayer. A large part of the time employed in suppressing slavery on the East Coast is expended in watching this small island. The outlay over the last twenty years may be put at a million sterling in hard cash, to say nothing of men lost in fighting and by fever.\n\nAt the present moment all is transit in on Zanzibar waters.

As formerly carried on, the Indian connection with the slave traffic was mainly represented by three classes of traders—viz.: 1. The Custom House officials, who received the duties on slaves, and were often willing partners in large ventures. 2. The well-to-do merchants, who advanced guns, cloth, beads, and money to Arabs and Waswahili, and also to the third class. 3. The smaller Khojah and Battiah speculators, who traded in slaves in the immediate neighbourhood, and supplied goods to Mrima kidnappers and other riff-raff of the Coast at an enormous rate of interest.

The second has suspended operations of late; but the third, tempted by high and immediate profits, continues operations on a reduced scale. As a specimen of the trade carried on by the third class, Captain Elton describes the case of a Battiah, who, during his temporary absence, had four slaves brought into Kilwa by a party of his own men (freed only a few days previously), and deliberately sold the whole four to a caravan leaving for Pangani. ""His defence,"" says Captain Elton, ""was that he gave his men cloth to trade for ivory only, and that, instead of obeying orders, they bought slaves, whom they sold to repay him for the loss of his goods. This defence was simply ridiculous. Ivory is not to be so readily purchased just beyond the town, and, moreover, the Battiah accompanied his men to the house of the public auctioneer, quarrelled over the price offered there, and subsequently sold directly to the leader of the gang, leaving the next morning, for a higher sum. Unfortunately it was too late to recover the slaves, but I inflicted a fine of 400 dollars, trying the case with assessors, one of whom was a prominent man of the offenders\' own religious sect."" Several other instances of contraband slave-trading and prompt dealing with the offence are mentioned by Captain Elton.

From Dar-es-Salaam the caravan route was followed, via Kisiju and the Kwale settlements, to Kilwa Kivinje, and the copal fields, and the Rufiji river (struck at the Fords of Mpenbwe), reported on. All the Mungao trading stations on the coast were next inspected in Her Majesty\'s ship Daphne, as far south as Mkindani Bay, the Rovuma settlement being deserted in consequence of local disturbances. A month was occupied in Kilwa and its vicinity, and subsequently Kondachi and the towns on the Mrima opposite to Zanzibar were visited. The annexed return will show the practical results—1,409 slaves have been registered and freed; 499 of whom have commenced life anew; 920 remained with former masters, and I believe a very heavy blow has been struck at the slave trade. Some few cases of concealment have necessarily escaped detection, but the scandal of slave-holding by British subjects on the 300 miles of sea-board travelled over may be considered virtually at an end, although it cannot be disguised that occasional inspection and prompt punishment in cases of offence against the law will be necessary to prevent matters gradually sliding back into the old groove. Active support and money-lending for the purposes and ends of the traffic by the better class of Khojah and Battiah merchant has beyond doubt ceased; neither, do I think, will it be renewed. The pains and penalties attached to complicity with the trade are known to all, and the Indian will hesitate before placing himself in the power of the Arab and Swahili, who can at any moment repudiate his debts and procure his creditors punishment. One of the results of the policy adopted has been to throw the Indian merchants more completely under our protection; their only link with the Arab Government being broken, a strong anxiety is evinced for increased consular superintendence of the coast and a suppression of the injustice exercised by the local authorities.""', 'last_edit_date': '1874-08-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_08_1874#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True
