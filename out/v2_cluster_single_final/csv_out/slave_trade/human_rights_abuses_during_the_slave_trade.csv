96,"British involvement and subsequent neglect on the Gold Coast facilitated the resurgence and continuation of the slave trade, including targeted exploitation of specific ethnic groups and the prevalence of child slavery.","The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present contrasting perspectives on the claim that British involvement and subsequent neglect on the Gold Coast facilitated the resurgence and continuation of the slave trade, including targeted exploitation of specific ethnic groups and the prevalence of child slavery. The General History of Africa does not provide direct evidence supporting this claim, instead highlighting British efforts to abolish the slave trade through treaties with local chiefs and the promotion of 'legitimate trade' in goods like palm oil and rubber. The textbook notes the continuation of domestic slavery and the involvement of various ethnic groups in the trade but does not specifically address a resurgence due to British neglect or targeted exploitation. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing the British government's failure to effectively suppress the slave trade, particularly in areas like Quittah and Whydah, where the trade thrived despite British efforts. The articles point to British neglect, such as the withdrawal of troops from strategic locations, leading to increased slave trading activities. They also highlight the exploitation of specific ethnic groups, like the Crepee, and the prevalence of child slavery, with reports of children being procured from the interior for sale on the coast. While acknowledging British efforts to suppress the trade through naval patrols and legal measures, the articles suggest a complex interplay of involvement and neglect, contributing to the persistence of the slave trade and the exploitation of vulnerable groups.","The General History of Africa textbook does not provide direct evidence to support the claim that British involvement and subsequent neglect on the Gold Coast facilitated the resurgence and continuation of the slave trade, including targeted exploitation of specific ethnic groups and the prevalence of child slavery.

The neglect is evident in the withdrawal of troops from strategic locations like Quittah, which led to its conversion into a hub for slave trading. The articles also mention the exploitation of specific ethnic groups, such as the Crepee, whose members were sold into slavery on the Gold Coast. Additionally, there is evidence of child slavery, with reports of thousands of boys and girls being bought and retained as slaves, and the practice of procuring children from the interior for sale on the coast. These details align with the claim, illustrating how British actions and inactions contributed to the persistence of the slave trade and the exploitation of vulnerable groups.

This was because the cost of weapons increased steadily, so that pro› gressively greater numbers of slaves had to be offered in exchange.

The main sources of supply, however, were not only the great djihäd conducted by the Muslim leaders of the north and the conflicts in Mossi territory. The trade was also fed from a host of channels that sluiced off slaves from peoples belonging to hundreds of chieftaincies, from the territories of the Tuareg to the areas bordering the trading posts on the coast. During the final decades of the nineteenth century, war broke out in virtually every decade and in virtually every region, and war meant captives. These victims were for the most part from sedentary agricultural communities, which served as a veritable breeding stock for the trade. Hence the underpopulated areas to be found in regions that were literally drained of their inhabitants. Tribute exacted in the form of captives was extremely heavy in many instances.

A few persons were sold in times of famine or for debt. But the majority of slaves were apparently taken by kidnapping, raiding and wars. The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda. Accordingly, the extensive influence exercised by the Aro over Igboland through its oracle did not become an integrative force.$^{9}$ The element of violence inherent in Aro addiction to the slave trade thus distinguished their influence from the earlier ritual influ› ence of the Nri people over wide areas of Igboland.\nIn the economic sphere also, the disruption to normal agricultural activities must have been considerable. In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars. The metal bars were turned into pewters, ritual bells, state swords, leg-rings, and other ornaments.

His report serves, however, to underline the serious problem raised by the revival of slave-trading on the East coast of Africa. During the period 1860-70, between 30000 and 35000 slaves arrived in the ports controlled by Zanzibar: some were kept on the spot to work in the clove plantations.

A second was Cuba and Brazil, which continued through most of the nineteenth century to obtain slaves from the still permitted trade 'south of the line', where the economies of the slave trade remained different, as we indicated above. 44 The nineteenth century up to Partition was, it has been argued, the era of 'informal empire' or the 'imperialism of free trade'.

Hence the fact that the role of the chartered companies in eighteenth-century West Africa was less than in the seven› teenth century has led some historians to speak of the rise of free trade. The very process of dismantling of the monopoly powers of chartered companies was however 'a gradual one', we are told; the shift to free trade 'was therefore somewhat limited'; and the explanation of the shift resided primarily in 'practical business reasons', to wit, the lower overhead costs and greater flexibility of response to an expanding slave-trade market.$^{46}$ As for the nineteenth-century era of even freer trade, it has been argued that it rather represented a serious restriction of free trade under the ideology of 'legitimate commerce'. 47 Britain's championship of the doctrine of free trade in"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'The Western impetus for abolition', 'content': ""Politically stronger states reacted differently to British pressure. France, eager for prestige, maintained its freedom of action by a pretence at legislation and by naval suppression patrols which remained innocuous in home waters for as long as they did on the coast. Between 1815 and 1830 the French illicit trade fitted out 729 slaving expeditions for the west and east coasts of Africa. But when it became clear that such operations no longer benefited French ports either financially or socially, the government signed a reciprocal search agreement. Another reason was that the mon› archy that emerged after the 1830 revolution felt it desirable to gain Britain's goodwill.$^{7}$ This volte-face by the French resulted in several small countries acceding to the 1831-3 agreements. Britain took the opportunity to renew its attempts to internationalize the issue, and extended its naval suppression to cover the whole of the Atlantic and Indian oceans. An 'equipment' clause in the treaties allowed the seizure of ships obviously equipped for the slave traffic, even though not carrying human cargoes. But the slave ships of the USA remained exempt. For forty years American diplomacy managed to evade any serious commitment. In 1820 the trade was legally equated with piracy; in 1842 came the compromise of'checking the flag', which protected the Americans from British suppressive action; and 80-gun suppression squadrons served to safeguard national pride whilst at the same time remaining mere formalities. In the 1840s the Southern planters called for the legal reopening of the trade, and meanwhile took to breeding slaves for the home market on special ranches.$^{8}$ During the Civil War the Lincoln administration committed itself to the right of search, which had been in abeyance since 1820.

Given the fact that 'the bigger financiers clearly had a foot in both camps' (ibid., p. 86), the resulting Parliamentary decisions might be seen as a compromise: the West Indian lobby lost on abolition but won on the East Indian tariff.

Estimates of the traffic in human cargoes during the nineteenth century have never been reliable.

But they differ in their own estimates. E. A. Alpers$^{34}$ challenges C. S. Nicholls's figure of 20 000 traded annually. He notes that A. M. H. Sheriff$^{35}$ errs on the conservative side when he arrives at a figure of only 2500 slaves a year during the 1830s (basing the figure on importation into Muscat, Kharaq and Basra) since he seems to underestimate the importance of domestic slaves by concentrating on slaves used in the date plantations in the Persian Gulf area. But F. Cooper gives no figures of his own. He merely notes that the slave export trade from Zanzibar to the Gulf was profitable business throughout the first half of the nineteenth century.

But Seyyid Said encouraged the expansion of clove and coconut plantations in Zanzibar and Pemba. By the time he transferred his capital to Zanzibar in the 1840s, clove plantations were already the domi› nant economic activity and were mostly operated by slave labour. This created a class of landowners, originally mainly Arabs, but by the 1860s including indigenous Shirazi and Indians as well. By the 1860s it is estimated that the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba were absorbing about 10 000 slaves per annum. This was in addition to those supplied to other markets (largely Arab) abroad. It has been estimated that by the 1860s the Zanzibar market alone was handling as many as 70 000 slaves per annum and that the heaviest traffic started after 1840.$^{1}$ Although these figures may have been greatly exaggerated, they do indicate that the slave trade has increased tremendously by the middle of the nineteenth century.\nThe second commercial commodity exported from East Africa was ivory. In Chapter 9 we saw how its market was beginning to expand in the first decades of the nineteenth century due to increased demand in the industrialized West, apart from the traditional market in India. Previously Europe and the USA had obtained their ivory from West Africa. The demand for East African ivory, however, increased when it was discovered that it was of better quality (softer) and therefore more suitable for making luxury goods, such as combs, billiard balls and piano keys, which the richer classes were demanding. All British efforts to control this trade directly from East Africa failed because Indian merchants were already well entrenched in conducting the trade through Bombay from where it was re-exported to Europe. Only a few American traders were able to establish themselves gradually in Zanzibar as the most important Western traders, although they remained heavily dependent on the Indian merchants.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Marketing', 'content': ""Occasionally African producers defended their interests collectively through hold-ups (refusals to deliver produce to market).

Within a twelvemonth after the Union Jack had been hauled down from the flagstaff upon the batteries of Cape Coast Castle, the slave-trade would be rampant along the entire sea-line whence the diabolical traffic has been absolutely driven. This assertion can be proved by simple reference to an event of most recent standing. A certain Governor of the Gold Coast took it into his administrative head to recommend to the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the small batch of troops quartered in the little fort at Quittah should be withdrawn, and that the fort itself should be quietly put beyond the pale of English jurisdiction. Relying on the good sense and judgment of his lieutenant, as in a measure he must rely, the Secretary of State assented. What was the issue?

L. Cameron, R.N., C.B. The Earl of Dundonald was in the chair.\n\nCommander Lovett Cameron, in the course of his opening remarks, said the slave trade went on all round the continent of Africa, and commerce had gone on with it. Our trade with the West Coast of Africa had gone on since the time of the Tudors. For centuries that trade was in slaves, and its increase was slow; but after several blows had been struck at that trade—among others by the liberation of slaves in the West Indian Islands, in America, and in Cuba—instead of their being any injury done to our commerce, our trade with the West Coast of Africa increased by leaps and bounds. It was only in 1850 or shortly after that we attacked a great nest of slave dealers in Lagos, and in 1861 it was made a British colony. Up to that time there had been no trade there except in slaves; but last year the trade of Lagos amounted to £357,831 imports, and £538,980 exports. And yet only thirty-eight years ago that place was of absolutely no value to us for legitimate commerce. On the Gold Coast slavery had been practically abolished by the British Government, but yet there was a good deal still existing owing to the native customs of the people. Even if the export of slaves from Africa was prevented entirely, the internal trade in them would still be enormous.\n\nFormerly the slave trade was subsidiary to the ivory trade, but when porters were no longer wanted for the latter, the former remained, only the men were killed and the women and children carried away. It had been said that domestic slavery must be allowed, and that was a very difficult question to settle. In his opinion, we should, as in India, abolish the legal status of slavery, but should not rout out all the households where no complaint was made. As long as domestic slavery existed there would be a market for slaves. We must have nothing to do with slavery; while the slave trade continued it was impossible for legitimate commerce to go on as it should! If the slave trade were done away with, they would find that all other trade would flourish.\n\nIn answer to questions Commander Lovett Cameron said he had avoided speaking of the Germans for diplomatic reasons.\n\nHe had a plan for the total abolition of slavery in Africa, which he hoped to explain shortly. It was, in brief, to establish a barricade across the country by the way of the lakes, and to get authority to maintain order on that line.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, on February 26, presided over a large meeting, held in Exeter Hall, when two African explorers, Commander Cameron and Captain Hore, were announced to speak.'}, {'id': 6014, 'article_title': 'SLAVERY IN A BRITISH COLONY.', 'full_section_title': 'SLAVERY IN A BRITISH COLONY.', 'last_edit_date': '08-29-1890', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1890#article-3', 'issue_date': '01_10_1890', 'content': 'The following important correspondence upon the existence of slavery within her Majesty\'s dominions has recently appeared in the London Times:—\n\nSir,—I trust you will consider the subjoined correspondence with the Colonial Office important enough for insertion in your paper.

It is true that the export in this locality is almost, although not entirely, kept under by the vigilance of the squadron, but this is only effected by keeping a number of men-of-war (there were six in December last) anchored within two miles of the coast, at short distances from each other, with armed boats in the intervals; an arrangement entailing the severest and most trying duties on the officers and men employed, and attaining its partial success only at very great cost to the country.\n\nIf the present trade of the settlements be compared with that of any other British possessions, it is not certainly of any great moment; but, such as it is, it owes its continuance mainly to the encouragement and protection which their presence affords it.

At Whydah an extensive trade in palm-oil has existed since 1849, and yet slaves have been regularly shipped from that port up to the present day, and, as has been already stated, a cargo was awaiting embarkation there in December last. Nor is this difficult to explain; palm-oil, which forms the principle article of trade, is collected by natives, chiefly domestic slaves, residing at or near the coast, its weight and bulk preventing it from being brought from a great distance in a country where there are no rivers; and it is evident that it would answer the chiefs better to turn their labour to account in this way than to sell them for exportation, even were not the customs of the country entirely opposed to such a proceeding. There is nothing, however, to prevent the chiefs from purchasing for export any number of the slaves captured in the hunts which are regularly undertaken for this purpose in certain parts of the interior, and so legitimate commerce and the slave-trade may be found combined in any spot on the coast to which British authority or influence does not extend.\n\nThus the existence of the British settlements, and of the Republic of Liberia, has served to eradicate the slave-trade from all but one spot on the 1,500 miles of coast extending from the Gambia to Quittah; and the recent acquisition of Lagos may be said to have freed almost entirely from the curse the remainder of the coast; the two exceptions being the small spot between the Gambia and Sierra Leone, the case of which has already been referred to in the report on the latter colony, and a portion of the sea coast lying between Quittah and Lagos, immediately in the rear of which are the dominions of the notorious King of Dahomey.\n\nIt is well known that, from the peculiar circumstances of his country, this monarch is indebted for his wealth and the maintenance of his authority over his people almost exclusively to the slave-trade. Whydah, the chief seaport of his dominions, is, as it has always been, the principal place of export; and advantage is also taken, when the vigilance of the cruisers renders it necessary, of the independent towns of Great Popo, Aghway, and Little Popo, situated to the westward, the inhabitants of which are only too ready to afford every facility for a trade from which they derive such profit.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SLAVERY ON THE GOLD COAST', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Committee of the Aborigines\' Protection Society recently called Lord Carnarvon\'s attention to the Gold Coast correspondence of the Scotsman, which confirmed the statements previously made as to the revival of the slave trade with the Ashantees, and, in addition, contained evidence of the comparative ease with which slavery itself might be abolished.

Consul O’Neill, reporting from Mozambique, estimates the present export of slaves from the Mozambique coast alone at from 3,000 to 4,000 per annum. The cruisers on that coast are very active. In the four years 1876-79 they succeeded in freeing 991 slaves, and it is not their fault that they do not do more. When we glance at the area which includes slaving operations, and compare it with the number of vessels employed to check the slave trade, the difficult nature of the task is at once apparent. The total length of coast from which slaving operations are carried on may be said to be over 1,000 miles, and the sea area upon which British cruisers are employed is over 500 square miles. The work of suppressing the traffic is left in the main to England. The Portuguese are only spasmodic in their action, and difficult to move quickly when slaves are reported by our officers in their neighbourhood. They always let the news get wind, delay after delay occurs, until they arrive just in time to find the slaves gone. The Portuguese vessels of war are worn out or useless, and the French, as we shall show presently, hinder rather than assist in the suppression of the trade. As to other Great Powers, they do not profess to take part in the work, so that we have only to rely upon ourselves for all active measures. Yet the greatest number of ships we have furnished for service in these waters has hitherto been three, and they are usually the most worthless ships in the Navy. To suppose that the slave trade on the East Coast of Africa can be destroyed by means so disproportionate to the end aimed at is to credit English officers with impossibilities. We think but little of spending four or five millions, in another part of the same continent, in invading the country of a neighbour who has never wronged us; we spend double that sum without a murmur upon a fruitless march upon Coomassie; yet we cannot afford to substitute swift cruisers for worn-out hulks when the work to be done is the freeing of the slave! Nor must it be forgotten that, the more efficient the service, the greater the number of captures made, the more money goes to the Treasury from the sale of condemned ships.

Some were captives taken in the wars waged by the southern Ethiopian kingdom of Shoa on the Oromo ('Galla') peoples along its borders. The slaves were carried in caravans of several hundreds and transported to the Ethiopian coast for shipment at the ports of Berbera, Zeila, Tajura, Assab, Obock and Massawa, from where they were ferried across the Red Sea to the ports of Jeddah, Mocha, and Hoideida. Buyers came from several towns in the Yemen and the Hidjâz. There were also seaborne traders from the Hadramawt, Zanzibar, Oman, India and the Persian Gulf. This trade was largely in Arab hands backed by Indian financiers from the Gujarat (Banians). 6\nThe major source of supply of slaves to Asia was, however, eastern Africa. As pointed out by J. B. Kelly,$^{7}$ the slave trade from Zanzibar was virtually a monopoly of the Muscat Arabs and their rulers who derived their revenue mostly from the custom duties levied on the trade. In the early nineteenth century, Muscat was the greatest clearing house of the traffic to the Gulf, Persia, Irak and India, but as the century wore on its dominance was to be challenged by the port of Sur to the southward. The majority of the slaves landed at Muscat were sold within Oman itself. The rest were bought by agents from the Trucial Coast, notably the Kawâsim, for resale on the coast or in the markets of Persia, Irak, Bahrain, Kuwait, Hasa and Nadj. From Muscat and Sur, slaves were also conveyed to the ports of SindhTKutch, Kathiawar and the Bombay Presidency, in Bahraini, Kuwaiti and Indian bottoms.

Hence the underpopulated areas to be found in regions that were literally drained of their inhabitants. Tribute exacted in the form of captives was extremely heavy in many instances. When indigenous peoples took action to organize their own defence, they were frequently used as mercenaries in wars elsewhere, as in the case of some of the Gurunsi who fought in the ranks of the Zamberma, and the Samo (Sanan) who took part in the dynastic wars of Yatenga."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Niger delta > The Igbo hinterland', 'content': 'The predominantly disruptive character of the slave trade may be shown in different ways. First, the manner in which slaves were procured tended to destroy social and political structures. Social outcasts, offenders against the law, were sold into slavery. A few persons were sold in times of famine or for debt. But the majority of slaves were apparently taken by kidnapping, raiding and wars. The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda. Accordingly, the extensive influence exercised by the Aro over Igboland through its oracle did not become an integrative force.$^{9}$ The element of violence inherent in Aro addiction to the slave trade thus distinguished their influence from the earlier ritual influ› ence of the Nri people over wide areas of Igboland.\nIn the economic sphere also, the disruption to normal agricultural activities must have been considerable. In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars. The metal bars were turned into pewters, ritual bells, state swords, leg-rings, and other ornaments. But these supplies replaced local industries, and the Awka smiths turned their backs on local sources of metal.

The Lozi aristocracy and landlords also used slaves to dig canals and ditches in order to bring fertile marshy soil into cultivation. By the last quarter of the century it was estimated that a quarter of the Lozi population were slaves. Similarly, Nguni dynamism was premised upon their ability to incorporate and extract surplus from their large pool of captives. 51 Allowing for local variations, a broad pattern of economic dislocation resulting from the slave trade is nevertheless discernible. The violent disruption of much of the rural economy, the export of many of the most productive members of the indigenous societies, the inadvertent introduction of highly contagious diseases, and the growing dependence of the Central African economy on the world trading system intensified the process of underdevelopment. It is true that this process was accompanied by the dissemination of new crops such as tobacco, maize, rice and cassava, the introduction of modest technological innovations like the Chikunda traps, granaries, and weapons, and the expansion of some local industry. But these were relatively insignificant developments when placed in juxtaposition to the economic retardation of the region as a whole. 52 Little needs to be said about the unprecedented level of destruction that While slavery had been a feature of many Central African societies before the slave trade, preliminary evidence suggests a growing tendency to acquire captives to extract surplus which the aristocracy used to maintain its privileged position. To the extent that slaves acquired as corvØe labourers tended to become chattel, the nature of slavery often changed from earlier forms which emphasized the reproductive role and the use of slaves primarily to expand the size of the kinship network. accompanied the raids and the expansionist activities of the slave-traders. Fields were ravished, entire villages destroyed and survivors often com› pelled to flee their homelands and resettle in inaccessible, unproductive locations. One nineteenth-century traveller recalled the effect of the Yao raids in the 1860s against the Manganja: A number of the Manganja went with them. Everywhere they saw sad signs of the war - villages burnt, gardens uncared for, the beautiful land about them rapidly becoming desert.

In several instances, they overstepped their authority and enslaved their own subjects or neighbours in order to main› tain the flow of wealth and weapons upon which their power rested. The Makua aristocracy pursued such a self-destructive strategy. Until the 1850s the Makua had been the principal exporters of slaves to Mozambique Island. One by-product of their predatory activities was a large-scale migration of the victimized societies. Faced with a diminished labour pool the Makua rulers began raiding each other and enslaving their own subjects in order to maintain the profitable slave trade on which they had become totally dependent. Within two decades the Makua were badly fragmented, leaving them easy prey to subsequent Portuguese invasions.$^{47}$ The AfroPortuguese prazero community exhibited a similar myopic desire for profits which precipitated the rapid demise of the prazo system. As in the case of the Makua chiefs, the prazeros violated their historic charter and began to enslave people living on their lands when they could no longer acquire captives from the interior. In reaction to these excesses the indigenous population either revolted and drove the prazeros off the land or fled into the interior, depriving the estate owner of his traditional source of tribute. The effect, in either case, was the destruction of most prazos by 1830, and those that managed to survive suffered from recurring famines that so debilitated the indigenous population that they proved no match for the attacks of the subsequent decades.

The price per slave had been fixed in advance in the local money of account, the copper bar, equivalent to a specific quantity of goods - the same as in earlier periods. In 1825 and 1829 men and women were worth 67 bars, and the price went down as low as 45 or 50. In terms of the value of the landed cargo, the price per slave was 33 Spanish dollars, of which 8-10 per cent went to the distributors by way of commission. At Duke Town, Duke Ephraim's city in Old Calabar, the heads of other more or less rival houses, Egbo Eyo, Tom Honesty and Ogan Henshaw, helped to make up cargoes with slaves or foodstuffs. Forty thousand yams cost 2000 bars, the price of forty slaves.

But this does not mean that they were constitutionally incapable of giving up the trade, as Western supporters of slavery maintained. The continuance of the supply of exportable manpower from Africa can be logically explained in economic terms. That the distributors were black and the exporters white is irrelevant: it was a paying proposition, profitable to both trading partners, whose sole object was to make money. That was the situation at the grass roots. The continuance of the supply is to be explained in terms of the efficient working of an integrated system: and what Africans were resisting was the disruption of this system.

This also explains the fall in the selling price of exportable manpower: it was the market's defence against growing pressure from the forces of suppression.

Awaye, a town of several thousand farming people, has been taken by the Ibadans, destroyed, and the inhabitants carried away as slaves. The rage of war, the hate of tribe against tribe, is increasing. Makun, a town of 8,000 people, was taken by the Abeokutans, after a siege of three months. The people were all made slaves. An eye-witness says: ""Thousands of them were carried to Abeokuta, many in a miserable state, necessitating their being carried in baskets by their captors. It was a heartrending scene to see these poor people carried along—husbands without their wives, mothers without their children, the latter without their parents; and most of them destined to spend the remainder of their lives in slavery.""\n\nThe Ibadans are now encamped at Ipara, a small Ijebu town, about a day\'s journey south of Ibadan; the Ijebus and Egbas have their camp in Makun, a short day\'s journey south of Ipara, and only one day\'s journey from the coast. It is said that the Ibadans have pressed the Dahomans to attack Abeokuta under these favourable circumstances.\n\nThe same authority says that there seems to be no hope at present of any pacification. Men\'s passions are inflamed; there are many who love war for the sake of plunder; the love of man-stealing, of catching slaves, is increasing. And yet, in consequence of the favourable position of Abeokuta as regards Lagos, of the successful efforts of missionaries during the last twenty years, and the constant demand made by merchants for produce, ""food in Abeokuta is abundant, the markets are well stocked, the farms well cultivated, a considerable quantity of cotton is going forward to Lagos for England, and more cotton seed has been sown than in any former year.""'}, {'id': 397, 'article_title': 'ACCRA', 'full_section_title': 'ACCRA', 'last_edit_date': '06-11-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1864#article-8', 'issue_date': '23_07_1864', 'content': '2.

After some time she said, \'We have forgotten to take water with us.\' She therefore put me down under a tree, and said she would go and fetch water. During her absence a stranger came and said to me, \'What are you doing here?\' I said, \'My mother went to fetch water, and will soon be back.\' The man stooped down and took me up. He pressed me on his chest, went a long way, and brought me to his village. There he cut my face, to mark me as a slave. When the wound was healed, he sold me to another place. I was sold several times, till I came to Anyako, where the missionaries liberated me,"" &c.\n\nIt seems to be a common thing that a child found alone is taken up and sold. If a stop were put to that hideous slavetrade, this man-stealing would soon cease also. In Accra, Aquapem, &c., it is unknown. Only in Kroboe it happens sometimes, because the thieves are able to sell their ""chattels"" to leeward. But the North German Mission Society, or Bremen Society, have four stations in that country, and hard work they have undertaken. As nearly every day such unfortunate children as already mentioned were offered to them, of course for ""sale,"" they wrote to Europe for funds, and they have with money, which has been contributed for this purpose, liberated more than 100 children. They have two flourishing schools at Anyako, a few miles north-east from Quittah, and another one at Ho, three or four days\' journey in the interior. The people respect them now, finding that they have come not to trade in human flesh, but to bring them the best of all gifts, a Saviour. They are very much troubled by the lawless people, who steal all they can, and break even by night into their houses. But a good number of the population already take part with them, and protect them.\n\nAnd now again to our old song, ""The fort of Quittah."" It is grievous not to repair that fort, and place a garrison of twenty to thirty men there. By so doing the slave-trade might be checked very much.

We stated some time since that these were all slavetraders, and had complete rule over the country, in which they were committing great atrocities. The ""Dutch Ladies"" wished to go to Niama. Two of the most influential traders—viz., Biselli and Ali Amouri, seem to have been the great culprits. After stating the straits to which they were reduced, owing to the perfidious conduct of these slavetraders, Mr. Tinne says that one of the ladies in their letter goes on to state how negroes were beaten, and in some cases shot, for attempting to relieve them; that Ali Abu Amouri, when applied to for help, refused to give it except upon terms equally outrageous with those of Biselli, and also forbade his negroes to sell to or assist them in any way. Selim also, Ali\'s steward, robbed them in every way possible, and encouraged his men to do so too. Their people attempted to build huts to spend the rainy season in, but Biselli refused the help of his negroes, without which help they could not get materials. M. von Henglin, a well-known scientific traveller who accompanied the expedition, confirms this, and gives particulars of other very atrocious acts. He states that a soldier of his party had bought four elephants\' tusks from a native sheik; on learning which fact the people of the merchant Ali Abu Amouri attacked the negroes, took the sheik and several others prisoners, and killed the sheik\'s wife. The captured negroes would be sold as slaves. M. Kleinzinik, another traveller, had sent them about fifteen porters from a neighbouring station, Roulanda, with corn bought from the merchant Biselli, but having arrived near Biselli\'s zeriba, they were arrested by one of his dragomen, who forced the negroes with threats to return with their loads. They next attempted to buy corn from the tribes of the Niam-Niams; and a sheik was bringing them a good supply, when they were met by men of Ali Abu Amouri, who put both the negroes and Henglin\'s soldiers in irons, and took them to the zeriba of Ali, where the soldiers were at last released, but the negroes detained as slaves, and three of their number, who had escaped, were retaken and shot.

The Ibadans, as we are informed, are now in arms ready for this place, or may go to the Ijebu territory if the Dahomans fail to come forward. Of course we are not behind in our preparations. Our numerous farmers around are all in, ready to man our walls. Two of our villages, Ishals and Abo, not being aware that the Dahomans would pass by their roads, were suddenly carried off to hopeless slavery; guns and powder not being supplied to them from Abeokuta this year, which still renders these poor creatures a hopeless defence. Rumours say they will be in all about 500 souls—men, women, and children! To say nothing of the dead! Thus you see the evil ordinance, prohibiting and supplying guns, &c., in certain cases.\n\nYou would not be surprised to hear of our roads of produce, going down to Lagos, being blockaded on the 18th ult. Apart from the grievance before mentioned, guns and powder have been distributed to our territories below Otta by the Lagos Government; this additional evil has been the cause of the roads being finally closed up, until better understanding for peace can be arrived at between the two Governments.\n\nAll your letters for January to the Secretary of State were read to the Egbas; his lordship\'s reply to your letters not being favourable, and because of the implicit confidence and good faith which we have already planted in the minds of the Egbas towards Her Majesty the Queen and good people in England, the Board of Management has refrained reading that reply to His Supreme Majesty Oyekon, as it will cause grief and loss of confidence in the minds of the Egbas, who are strongly allied with the sister country, Ijebus, for peace or war against their common enemies. The people of Abeokuta have no more faith in Glover\'s Administration, and so long as England would not believe your letters, although truthfully and justly written for the good of Africa, I am afraid ""the roads here, as well as in other places around, will remain perfectly closed, until the death of Glover or his final removal from Lagos.""

Wishing to see the slaves actually at work, he visited the sugar plantation of Tolosa, near the town of Marianao, ten miles from the capital. Captain Townshend was received at the gate of the plantation by an old negro armed with a musket, who examined his pass before allowing him to proceed. Driving through immense fields of cane, he reached the \'ingenio\' or manufactory, and was received by an English overseer. It was fitted up with the best and most modern machinery from England, France, and the United States, and was regarded as a model of its kind. The first glimpse of slavery was a group of from fifty to sixty negro children, apparently from six to twelve years old, and of both sexes, occupied in piling the canes on the elevator which conveyed them to the crushing wheel. \'Toiling away for their very lives in the broiling sunshine, the poor little wretches kept a constant eye on a formidable cow-hide whip wielded by a negro who stood by, ready to crack it across their bare backs if they attempted to idle or eat the sugar-cane.\' Inside the building, negroes, negresses, and Chinese were tending the machines or standing in the vats treading out the lumps in the hardened sugar with bare feet, their unclothed bodies streaming with perspiration. But it was in the negro barracks that the hideous features of this \'sum of all villainies\' came out. The dwellings stood round a large square, which was entered through double iron gates. \'As we passed in,\' says the writer, \'two ferocious-looking Cuban bloodhounds chained, one on either side of the gate, sniffed suspiciously near our legs, but being trained to run down or attack negroes only, did not molest us.\' On the ground floor were the negroes\' rooms, secured by heavily-barred and padlocked doors. These rooms were veritable dens, walls black with dirt, uneven floors about fourteen feet square, no means of letting in air or daylight, and the whole in a condition impossible to describe. \'In each of these pestiferous dungeons a whole family lived, in a condition more foul and degraded than any beasts of the field.\' \'We looked into several, and found them all alike.\' Mounting a staircase, at the foot of which another bloodhound was chained, they found themselves in a gallery running round the court, out of which opened large and tolerably ventilated rooms, used as sick wards, nurseries, and for other purposes. Here were scores of children of every shade \'from jet black to nearly white,\' happy enough in their childish ignorance, \'playing,\' says Captain Townshend, \'with some bloodhound puppies, little thinking of their unhappy lot, or of the use to which these same puppies would shortly be put.\''}, {'id': 4104, 'article_title': 'SOUTH-WEST AFRICA', 'full_section_title': 'SOUTH-WEST AFRICA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1880#article-19', 'issue_date': '01_12_1880', 'content': '## SOUTH-WEST AFRICA.\n\n**LISBON, Nov. 15.**—The negro slave-dealer, Mocussi, who had been captured and sentenced to imprisonment for life to the West Coast of Africa, has died in his captivity at Cape Verde.

The depositions of the witnesses, which are now for the first time published in this country, show that indescribable cruelties were committed by these ruffians and their accomplices, among whom, it will be remembered, was the wife of Williams. Two slave girls were subjected to frightful brutalities, although fortunately only one died. They were tied back to back and severely flogged by the man John, and by Mrs. Williams. Then a troop of school children were actually sent for to continue the flogging, and many of the boys, it appears, supplied themselves with sticks from a guava tree, and shamefully beat the poor girls in the presence of the ex-missionaries and their wives. Subsequently they were cruelly tortured with cayenne pepper; one of them—Amé by name—dying in the course of the night, a bottle of rum being given to the man who buried her to bribe him not to tell what had happened. The culprits richly merited the severe sentences which were ultimately passed upon them; but many readers of the Correspondence will be disposed to think that it was a case which called for the infliction of the extreme penalty of the law, at all events against two of the offenders. The prosecution was beset with difficulties, owing to the fact that the outrages were committed in districts beyond British jurisdiction. Ultimately a Commission was appointed under the Great Seal for the trial of the prisoners, but the Commissioners nevertheless describe this machinery as ""cumbrous,"" and as ""extremely difficult in the working.""

There are various tribes of black men, specially the cannibal Niam-Niams, so graphically described by Dr. Schweinfurth, who are even more fiendlike than the Arabs. Moreover, the slave-hunters\' armies are composed of slaves who are often more ferocious than their captors. When a party of slave-hunters wish to make a raid, they visit some friendly chief, and by presents and promises cajole him to assist them in their terrible work. They then join forces and prepare to attack some neighbouring tribe, whose cattle are to be given to the black and friendly allies, whilst the Arabs carry off the human spoil. Then in the early morning, before the sun has risen, the combined forces steal upon their sleeping and unsuspecting victims. Some of the huts and houses are first fired, and then in the confusion which ensues, the men capable of bearing arms are shot down, and the old of both sexes are butchered with every refinement of cruelty, and all the young men, young women, and children are chained and yoked together to be driven off and sold as slaves. In the long and painful march fresh horrors are of hourly and daily occurrence. Those who fall out of the line, and can no longer drag the heavy and ponderous sheebah, or wooden yoke, are murdered in cold blood or left to perish of hunger. Women, who are nursing, have their babies dashed against a stone before their eyes, as it is known they could not carry their burden for many days. In order to strike terror into a tribe, it is a common practice to seize the headmen, and after burying them up to their necks with their faces towards the fierce African sun, to cut off their eyelids, and leave them to die in torments.

His servants, who had drawn water from this spring, without observing it, carried off in the bucket the skull of a man.

This privileged land is the theatre of slavery, and the home of the man-hunter. The large city of Kouka, in the vicinity of Lake Tchad, the capital of Bornou, is one of the greatest marts for this human merchandise.\n\nOn the Square, the best adapted for the slave-markets, one is sure every day to find several hundreds; but on Monday, the great sale day, they may be numbered by thousands; the blacks are there exhibited in their pitiable plight, partially covered with miserable tatters.

The price demanded is according to his age, strength and colour of the prisoner, and varies from half a sovereign to five pounds for the current merchandise. Is this all that a man is worth, and is this the estimate put on human liberty? There are other markets at which the slave is considered of still less value.\n\nBut whence come all these wretched beings? It is here that the Eastern traffic is presented to us under a particular aspect, such as it did not assume on the western coasts of Africa in the organised commerce of slaves. Man-hunting, which supplies the victims for these markets, is not only encouraged by the brutal ferocity of the chief of a tribe; it is considered an act commanded by religion.\n\nThe Sultan, who goes to make razzias at the head of warriors, with whom he divides the booty, by an impious aberration believes that he performs a pious work in spreading devastation around him.

A few days since a slave was seized by a number of freemen, and dragged to the beach, close to our mission; they were about tying his legs together, but when they saw me descending the hill, they hurried him into a canoe, which was taken out into the middle of the river; the poor fellow was thrown into the water, but, being a swimmer, he tried to hold the canoe, but was beaten across the head with paddles and sticks. When I saw that they wanted to murder the man, I had my boat got ready, and was just rushing off, when Mr. Thomson came along in his boat. We pulled hard, but the cruel demons of men had broken the skull and marked the water with the man\'s blood; the poor fellow sunk just as Mr. Thomson was about to stretch out his hand to rescue. When the men in the canoe saw him sink, and that we were too late, they gave a savage shout of triumph. They landed amongst a large crowd of people on the beach; I followed them, and told them of their sin, and that it would be remembered against them.""\n\nIn another letter Mr. Smith continues the narrative: ""The slaves, who are powerful in numbers, were very angry, and banded themselves together the following morning and made an attack on the town, driving the freemen and their masters before them. Those who had committed the deed took shelter on mission-ground. The \'country-fashion,\' or superstition house, was burnt down; nearly all the plantain-trees were destroyed and two men wounded. Much consternation and danger prevailed. We were afraid other depredations would occur. Several headmen from A\'kwa town, myself, and two or three members, went amongst them, and got them, after much difficulty, to retire to their own quarters. Much inconvenience was felt by prohibiting the wives of the freemen going to their farms and obtaining food.

In a few days King A\'kwa returned home, had a meeting, and settled the serious palaver.

Rua, a very large section of country north and west of Cazembe\'s, but still in the same inland region, is peopled by men very like those of Insama and Cazembe. An Arab, Syde Bin Habib, went to trade in Rua two years ago, and as the Arabs usually do where the natives have no guns, Syde Bin Habib\'s elder brother carried matters with a high hand. The Rua men observed that the elder brother slept in a white tent, and, pitching their spears into it by night, killed him. As Moslems never forgive bloodshed, the younger brother forthwith ran amuck on all indiscriminately in a large district. Let it not be supposed that any of these people are like the American Indians—insatiable, bloodthirsty savages, who will not be reclaimed or enter into terms of lasting friendship with fair-dealing strangers. Had the actual murderers been demanded, and a little time been granted, I feel morally certain, from many other instances among tribes who, like the Ba Rua, have not been spoiled by Arab traders, they would all have been given up. The chiefs of the country would, first of all, have specified the crime of which the elder brother was guilty, and who had been led to avenge it. It is very likely that they would stipulate that no other should be punished but the actual perpetrator. Domestic slaves acting under his orders would be considered free from blame. I know of nothing that distinguishes the uncontaminated Africans from other degraded peoples more than their entire reasonableness and good sense. It is different after they have had wives, children, and relatives kidnapped; but that is more than human nature, civilised or savage, can bear. In the case in question indiscriminate slaughter, capture, and plunder took place. A very large number of very fine young men were captured and secured in chains and wooden yokes. I came near the party of Syde Bin Habib, close to the point where a rent in the mountains of Rua allows the escape of the great river Lualaba out of Lake Moero. And here I had for the first time an opportunity of observing the difference between slaves and freemen made captives. When fairly across Lualaba Syde thought his captives safe, and got rid of the trouble of attending to and watching the chained gangs by taking off both chains and yokes. All declared their joy, and perfect willingness to follow Syde to the end of the world or elsewhere, but next morning twenty-two made clear off to the mountains. Many more, on seeing the broad Lualaba roll between them and the homes of their infancy, lost all heart, and in three days eight of them died. The had no complaint but pain in the heart, and they pointed out its seat correctly; though many believe that the heart is situated underneath the top of the sternum or breast-bone. This to me was the most startling death I ever saw. They evidently died of broken-heartedness, and the Arabs wondered, \'seeing they had plenty to eat.\' I saw the others perish, particularly a very fine boy of ten or twelve years of age. When asked if he felt ill he put his hand correctly and exactly over the heart. He was kindly carried, and as he breathed out his soul was laid gently on the side of the path. The captors were not unusually cruel. They were callous—slaving had hardened their hearts. When Syde, who was an old friend of mine, crossed the Lualaba, he heard that I was in a village where a company of slave traders had been furiously assaulted for three days by justly-incensed Babeemba. I would not fight nor allow my people to fire if I saw them, because the Babeemba had been especially kind to me. Syde sent a party of his own people to invite me to leave the village by night, and come to him. He showed himself the opposite of hard-hearted; but slaving \'hardens all within, and petrifies the feelings.\' It is hard for the victims, and for the victimisers.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1872#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COMMERCIAL COMPANIES FOR AFRICAN TRADE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'But it takes so long to undo evil, and destroy its baneful venom among mankind, that the infamous slave-trade, though scotched, is not yet killed.

This land was controlled by the Yao, who were responsible for transporting ivory, wax and slaves to Kilwa. The Yao continued to play an important part in this trade even during the peak period in the nineteenth century.\nTheir prominence in the second half of the nineteenth century, therefore, was dependent on their eminence in the regional trade of this area in the previous period. As already mentioned, the geographical position was in their favour. But more important was the effect this regional trade had on the society itself.

Previously much more emphasis has been put on the effects of the Nguni invasion in causing this transformation.

Therefore, except for isolated pockets like Khota-Khota and Karonga in present-day Malawi, the Arabs were never in control of the trade; they were generally clients of the powerful Yao chiefs to whom they supplied guns and other trade goods and with whom they shared the spoils. 5', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.71, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': ""Famines and psychological stress also left the uprooted and malnourished vulnerable to infectious diseases carried by the coastal traders. Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

Similarly, Nguni dynamism was premised upon their ability to incorporate and extract surplus from their large pool of captives. 51 Allowing for local variations, a broad pattern of economic dislocation resulting from the slave trade is nevertheless discernible. The violent disruption of much of the rural economy, the export of many of the most productive members of the indigenous societies, the inadvertent introduction of highly contagious diseases, and the growing dependence of the Central African economy on the world trading system intensified the process of underdevelopment. It is true that this process was accompanied by the dissemination of new crops such as tobacco, maize, rice and cassava, the introduction of modest technological innovations like the Chikunda traps, granaries, and weapons, and the expansion of some local industry. But these were relatively insignificant developments when placed in juxtaposition to the economic retardation of the region as a whole. 52 Little needs to be said about the unprecedented level of destruction that While slavery had been a feature of many Central African societies before the slave trade, preliminary evidence suggests a growing tendency to acquire captives to extract surplus which the aristocracy used to maintain its privileged position.

Everywhere they saw sad signs of the war - villages burnt, gardens uncared for, the beautiful land about them rapidly becoming desert.

The Makua aristocracy pursued such a self-destructive strategy. Until the 1850s the Makua had been the principal exporters of slaves to Mozambique Island. One by-product of their predatory activities was a large-scale migration of the victimized societies. Faced with a diminished labour pool the Makua rulers began raiding each other and enslaving their own subjects in order to maintain the profitable slave trade on which they had become totally dependent. Within two decades the Makua were badly fragmented, leaving them easy prey to subsequent Portuguese invasions.$^{47}$ The AfroPortuguese prazero community exhibited a similar myopic desire for profits which precipitated the rapid demise of the prazo system. As in the case of the Makua chiefs, the prazeros violated their historic charter and began to enslave people living on their lands when they could no longer acquire captives from the interior. In reaction to these excesses the indigenous population either revolted and drove the prazeros off the land or fled into the interior, depriving the estate owner of his traditional source of tribute. The effect, in either case, was the destruction of most prazos by 1830, and those that managed to survive suffered from recurring famines that so debilitated the indigenous population that they proved no match for the attacks of the subsequent decades.

In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries.

Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier. Dahomey continued with the slave trade for as long as there were customers."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 117, 'article_title': 'RIVER ROVUMA, EAST AFRICA.', 'full_section_title': 'RIVER ROVUMA, EAST AFRICA.', 'last_edit_date': '10-10-1862', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1863#article-24', 'issue_date': '23_02_1863', 'content': '""We were on part of the slave route from Lake Nyassa to Quiloa (Kilwa), about thirty miles below the station of Ndonde, where that route crosses Rovuma, and a little further from the confluence of the Liende, which, arising from the hills on the east of the Lake Nyassa, flows into Rovuma.

We never saw ebony of equal size to what we met on this river; and as to its navigability, as the mark at which water stands for many months is three feet above what it is now, and it is now said to be a cubit lower than usual, I have no doubt that a vessel drawing when loaded about eighteen inches would run with ease during many months of the year.

It was Livingstone\'s appeal to the Universities that, later on, induced Mr. W. P. Johnson to spend, almost alone, seven years in these parts, going in and out among the people, and closely studying their life and condition. On his return to England last year, Mr. Johnson declared his conviction that the best way to effectually influence this vast region for good was to place upon Lake Nyassa, which is 300 miles in length, a steamer, which would give safe and regular access to the towns along its eastern shores. By a letter just received from Bishop Smythies, who is now at the lake, we learn that this steamer, sent out from England in small pieces at a cost of upwards of £5,000, is put together near to Lake Nyassa, and is shortly to begin her work upon its waters. The Bishop has with him a party of eight—clergy and artisans—and with the aid of the steamer his plan is to settle on an island close to one great slave ferry, and to establish sub-stations upon the mainland, using the island as a place of refuge when necessary. Your readers may be interested to know that the condition of the people who inhabit the eastern shores of Lake Nyassa is, from the Bishop\'s report, ""worse now than ever."" The people are living for protection in low marshy places, in utter terror and misery from continual raids. The motive of these raids is chiefly to feed the slave trade. The new steamer will begin its work just as the English Consul, Mr. Hawes, arrives to succeed the late Captain Foot, and it is hoped that this means of visiting the eastern shores of the lake may largely conduce to the beneficial effects of the Consul\'s presence there by affording him the means of transport. All who care for Africa, and wish to suppress the slave trade, will watch with interest the effect of this happy coincidence of effort—consular and missionary—upon this unhappy region. In the opinion of our Committee, presided over by the Bishop of Carlisle, the present is a distinct epoch in the history of the mission, and a most important step in fulfilling the purpose for which it was established.\n\nW.

The Livingstonia Mission is a memorial of Dr. Livingstone's life-work and his devotion to Africa, founded some time after his death by admirers of the great traveller-missionary especially among his own countrymen. It is not a denominational enterprise. It appeals for support to the friends of Christian missions in Africa, but its chief supporters are Free Churchmen and United Presbyterians. From the first it was intended that the mission should be more than a centre for evangelistic work. The aim of its promoters was to found a Christian industrial settlement, with the conversion of the natives to Christianity as its chief aim, but also seeking the introduction of civilization by the aid of commerce and industrial arts. Hitherto the mission has been remarkably successful, but the recent news shows that all the work beneficial to the natives and full of promise is endangered by the Arab slavers.\n\nThe villages destroyed by the Arabs were the following: Mweni-Mteti, Karambo, Mwandawanga, Mwaramura, Karoti, Kasangula, Mwanyongu, Malema, Karanga, Ngerenge, Fumbo, Mfuni, Chirapura, Mwaramba. All the people from these villages who were not killed or captured as slaves were driven either to the hills or to the northern extremity of the lake, where they found temporary protection in the country of the Wa-Mwamba, who are really a section of the Wa-Nkonde tribe.

The writer gives an idea of how matters were at that time in the Lake region, the tidings being brought down from the Lake by the Ilala. Mr. Buchanan, acting Consul, had gone with a party to endeavour to make peace with the Arabs, after which he left for the south. The party on board the Ilala, assisted by natives with guns, and backed up by Wankonda warriors with spears, prepared to attack the stockaded towns of the Arabs, marching from the intrenchment at Karongas to Salema\'s Town, six miles distant. Firing was commenced from behind an ant-heap with an elephant gun and fiery darts, the latter of which set fire to the thatched huts of the Arabs. A ""crow\'s nest"" for Arab sharpshooters was demolished, and it is said that Salema, the head chief, was killed at this time. A rush was to have been made by the besiegers, who were to have been signalled by the leader of the party, but as he raised his arm to signal it was shattered by an Arab bullet, and in the interval the Arabs from another town—Kopa-Kopa—sallied out and attacked the right flank of the whites, but were driven back. A council of war was held, when two came away on the Ilala, and seven whites remained to defend themselves until reinforcements arrived. The writer goes on to say: ""It is not a mere company squabble with the Arabs. It is on their side a war of extermination. They wish to root out from the region the influence of the white people, and while at present it is merely a few of the Arabs who are trying to drive us out, there are sufficient scoundrels round the Lake who will unite, if success is likely, to make it impossible for white men, whether missionaries or traders, to exist. We may soon be fighting for our lives."" The horrors of slavery and Arab atrocity are, he says, ""despite what England may think, very real, and Lake Nyassa is the very centre of the brutal trade."" He is of opinion that ""a gunboat on Nyassa, one on Tanganyika, and a few handy men at the business could make things as snug as possible over thousands of miles. They were a strong party at Mandala, and should give the Arabs a thorough dressing. The towns about to be stormed by a party which goes to the front are well stockaded with bullet-proof wood.""

The party proceeded from Blantyre up the higher course of the Shire River to Livingstonia, the mission station on the promontory at the south end of Lake Nyassa. This station has been somewhat unfortunate to Europeans, and has, therefore, been placed in charge of natives. At Livingstonia serious news was received from Karonga, the African Lakes Company's station at the north-western end of the lake. It was stated that the Arabs had made a wanton attack on the natives, and, after burning several of their villages, had threatened the English station. These outrages were, it seems, quite unprovoked and premeditated. The Arabs in the vicinity were apparently not numerous, but, owing to the policy of refraining from interference in native quarrels, and abandoning stations when attacked, adopted by the English missionaries and trading agents, the Arabs have grown audacious. As a result, the Arab traders are seriously threatening European influence in the region. The news received at Livingstonia was to the effect that the English agents there had been compelled to intrench themselves behind a rough stockade, and were awaiting reinforcements. A relief party was immediately organized, including four Europeans and eleven natives, and proceeded by steamer up the lake to Karonga, which was reached on November 4. Some alarm was felt on arrival, as, in consequence of the precautions adopted by the little garrison, the usual night signal was not given from the station. The reinforcement was apparently not an hour too soon. The whole country round about had been desolated by the Arabs, who had set fire to some reeds, in which many unfortunate natives had taken refuge, and shot the fugitives as they attempted to escape from the flames. Many are said to have been burned. The Arabs, after finishing off the natives, appear to have been in doubt as to the strength of the garrison before the arrival of the relief party, and endeavoured to draw it from its intrenchment by shouts and taunts. Its real weakness became known, however, and there was every reason to believe that had the reinforcements been longer delayed the station would have been attacked.

The increase of Arab power in Central Africa, and enormous growth of slave-hunting and the slave traffic in consequence, are notorious. The German traveller, Lieut. Wissmann, found extensive districts depopulated and burned by the Arabs in the Kassai and Sankaru regions. Then there has been the attack on the Stanley Falls Station. The wave of reviving Arab power which has been spreading westward from the Zanzibar coast is now, it appears, spreading southward also. The first impulse to this extension is said to date from the end of 1883, when for a time our policy of armed intervention on the coast was changed. Every Arab on the coast appears to have regarded this change as an indication that our opposition to the trade had been abandoned. The recent agreement between Germany and Portugal for the division of the country as far as Nyassa, and the limitation of the Sultan of Zanzibar's influence to a coast-zone ten miles wide, have probably also stimulated the Sultan to endeavour to extend his influence to the west beyond the regions claimed by Germany. Arab camps are being placed at commanding points on the slave-routes, and Arabs visit and settle in the villages of the more powerful of the native chiefs. In short, there appears to be evidence that the disturbances on the Tanganyika and Nyassa, and it may be at Stanley Falls, are not due merely to the turbulence of isolated Arab ivory and slave hunters, but are parts of something like a concerted movement. The suggestion certainly seems to throw a new light on the action or inaction of Tippoo Tib at Stanley Falls, and on the appearance of Arabs west of the Aruwimi on the Welle-Makua."", 'last_edit_date': '1888-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1888#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SLAVE-TRADE IN EAST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Reports from East Africa state that the slave-trade is reviving on the shores of Lake Nyassa and along the banks of the River Shire.

D. Young, R.N., and an ""Examination of a Route for Wheeled Vehicles between the East Coast of Africa and Ugogo,"" by the Rev. Roger Price. Sir R. Alcock presided. Mr. Young had been deputed by the Free Church of Scotland to navigate Lake Nyassa in a steamer specially constructed for the purpose. This vessel, called the Ilala, having been carried in sections and by negroes to the border of the lake, was put together there, and on October 12, 1875, was launched and commenced her voyage. Many storms were encountered, but, on the whole, the voyage was prosperous, and had the effect of impressing the Arabs with the notion that the English were about to take possession of the lake, and thereby to put an end to the slave-trade. Mr. Young hoped that this idea would be justified by the opening on our part of a legitimate trade in the various valuable products of the interior. At present slaves formed the main objects of commerce, encouraged by the chiefs, who offered their ivory with one hand and the slaves with the other. The slaves carried the ivory down to the coast, and then both were shipped by the Arabs. The steamer touched at more than one village which had been destroyed by the Arabs, and the inhabitants massacred; it being their practice to kill all their prisoners who were not suited for export.\n\nThe paper described the scenery that surrounded Lake Nyassa as being of the most picturesque and magnificent character. The second paper detailed the establishment by Mr. Price of a new route into Central Africa, which avoided the low marshy grounds in which so many of our African travellers had succumbed to the pernicious influence of the climate. Mr. Price travelled safely in a light cart drawn by four bullocks a distance of 200 miles to Ujiji, on the upper plateau, having traversed a beautiful country, and received every assistance from the natives. Mr. Price pronounced the route he had travelled to be less difficult than the bullock road from Graham\'s Town to Algoa Bay. After the usual discussion, in the course of which Dr. Cockerell, Bishop of Edinburgh, animadverted in strong terms on the complicity of the Portuguese authorities in East Africa with the slave-trade, and Sir Bartle Frere warmly eulogized the readers of the papers, the proceedings terminated with votes of thanks to Messrs.

On the west side are the stations at Cape Maclean and Bandawe, with sub-stations, amongst which is a mission to the Angoni, a marauding tribe of Zulu origin. Dr. Laws at Bandawe has won the confidence of the people. Some 500 or 600 people assemble in his schools, in which numbers of children are taught daily. From the sense of security which a mission station gives, a considerable population has settled in the neighbourhood, and they are offering to build schools themselves if Dr. Laws will supply the teachers. All this work is threatened if the African Lakes Company is to be subject to hindrances on the river below. There is another danger, that which arises from the impatience of the Arabs at the presence of Europeans, and their influence on the lake. For some time there seems to have been an abatement of those horrors which Dr. Livingstone describes as perpetrated by Arab slave traders. In all probability this has been caused by the presence of missionaries and traders, with their steamers on the lake. But surely we are not going to offer the spectacle to Europe of Lake Nyassa, discovered by English enterprise, on which subjects of Britain, alone of European Powers, have settled for purposes of trade or the higher purposes of religion, abandoned to the Arabs and the slave trade.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the Universities' Mission has begun work on the east side of the lake. Three years ago a steamer was sent out for its use in parts and put together at Matope, on the Shire; a mission station has been formed at Likoma, an island in the lake five miles from the shore. This island seemed to be healthier than the shores of the lake, and its bays afford anchorage for the steamer. Though the island is small, the population is probably nearly 3,000. The plan proposed is to form a central school on this island and a station for English missionaries, and to establish schools in the towns on the shores. A few young men from the freed slave school at Zanzibar have been sent to live in these towns and open schools, and it is hoped more will follow this year. All this work must depend very largely on there being a way to the sea by which supplies may be received. The great danger to the mission threatens on this side from the marauding tribe of the Magwangwara. The Bishop and missionaries have visited these people, who sweep the whole country for 500 miles in their raids, and at present they are on friendly terms with the mission. But it is reported that they have made a league with the Arabs who pass through their country, and it is possible that under pressure from them they may become dangerous to the work.

Mr. J. E. Carlyle, of 23, Talbot-road, Bayswater, informs us that more recent information, up to January 2, has been received from Mr. Stewart, C.E., who is in charge of the construction of the road from Lake Nyassa to Lake Tanganyika, the scene of the recent encounter. This is of a more hopeful character. Mr. Stewart, with the aid of some British mechanics, &c., lately began this road, taking as a basis Chiwinda's village, some ninety miles to the west of the north end of the Lake Nyassa. He had also with him a number of civilized and Christianised natives from the south end of the Lake. The road is being formed by the African Lake Company. It is not a missionary enterprise, although working in co-operation with the missionaries. Chiwinda being inland, caravans to the Lake are necessary to bring up stores. Several of these had safely passed, but these were either personally conducted by white men, or were exclusively composed of the more civilized natives. On the last occasion there was no white man, and there were a number of rawer natives from Chiwinda's village. The disaster occurred at a village on the way, belonging to Mombwera, a chief. Mr. Stewart confirms the statement that nineteen are missing, eleven of them being the more civilized natives, eight being from Chiwinda, and four only escaping. As to the nineteen missing, Mr. Stewart is not certain that some of them may not have been enslaved by the slave-gangs who have lately penetrated into the district, and are using their influence against the Europeans. Mr. Stewart believes that the road party had been guilty of little or no provocation, though there may have been some pilfering as regards Chiwinda's men. They were suddenly and savagely attacked, and three killed in the presence of the chief. Chiwinda felt naturally outraged at the loss of his men, engaged, as they were, in the service of the Company. He let Mr. Stewart know that if they would not aid him in obtaining satisfaction, he would certainly fight them. An expedition was organized, mainly with the aid of the principal chief on the Rombushe River—other chiefs around also volunteering their services. Mr. Stewart was, however, most desirous that the reprisals should not be of a severe character. The tribe had ample time given them to escape, and one life only was lost in a skirmish. A number of huts, however, were burned, and a banana grove destroyed. That the retaliation was not severe, is evident from the desire since expressed by Mombwera to make peace with the white men, and to offer them cattle as compensation. Mr. Stewart has meanwhile retired from Chiwinda, transporting safely back all his goods to the Lake, leaving, however, some cloth to Chiwinda, and some gifts for the relatives of the massacred men. He thus escapes further entanglements with Chiwinda. Nothing daunted, he proposes resuming operations this month (April) or next, although at the north end of the Lake there are still collisions of rival chiefs which may prove harassing. He has wisely decided to make the Lake the next time the basis of his operations, beginning at Karonga. He will thus have his road behind him, and will not for a time need to engage many porters. Should he succeed in making this road, there will be a line of route, rivers, lakes, and roads, extending to about 2,000 miles, from Quelemane, on the Indian Ocean, by the Zambesi Shia and Lake Nyassa, to the northern extremity of Lake Tanganyika."", 'last_edit_date': '1882-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1882#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.697, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East and Central Africa Foreign Slave Trade', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sometimes the wind causes the mouths of the wells to be filled with sand.

The statement of these men is somewhat alarming, and presents a new feature in the history of plunder and brutal treatment to persons which from time to time are reported to us as taking place on that river. The circumstances of the case are as follows: Towards the latter part of March last, Sallah, Corveh, and Siamah, traders, left Hortey, a small town in the vicinity of Quittah, under passport from the Government officer there, to proceed with three canoes, loaded with salt and cowries, to the Volta, bound for Salagha; on their way they landed at Engabee, a small town on the margin of the Volta, belonging to Dagado, King of Panto, in the Crepee country; and whilst in this place, a number of Houssa men, armed with guns, spears, bows, and arrows, having their drums beating, and headed by one Otuman Katto, came there; Otuman Katto then made them to understand, through the head men of Engabee, that he was authorized by his Excellency the Governor, by King Dagado, and by King Quajoe Dey, to prevent Ahwoonahs and Acquamoos going to Salagha; and that King Dagado and King Quajoe Dey having obtained the sanction of the white men to put to death all Ahwoonahs and Acquamoos who may come to their country, Sallah and his companions are to consider their heads as forfeited. At his command, these men were at once seized by the Houssas, and their hands held fast behind them to be bound, when the head men and people of Engabee interceded; a price was then set on them, and the sum of 330 heads of cowries, equal to 16l. 10s. sterling money, was paid to Otuman Katto, who then ordered them to return to their country. Such is the statement of these men. The Acquamoos men who were amongst them have also been plundered; but, for want of space, we are obliged to pass over that subject for the present. The question naturally presents itself, how long will such a state of things be allowed to continue in the Volta, and whether the Executive authorities on the Coast would not help to remove this evil in the way of trade?\n\nKing Dagado's territories are, in fact, not within the limits of the Protectorate, and the authorities on the Coast may be excused for taking no cognizance of offences which are committed in places beyond their jurisdiction; but the boldness and frequency with which these offences occur in the Volta, and the evil effects this may have on the trade there, demand the sympathy and interference of the authorities, for these offences are committed always by persons from the Coast, without the participation of the native chiefs."", 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1882#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

For illustrative purposes here we will employ Durand's medium and low estimates$^{29}$ (the latter because it will be argued later that it may be closer to the truth than the new constant population estimates). Concentrating on four time periods, the sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth centuries, and calculating annual average rates per thousand base popula› tion, the medium estimate yields emigration rates rising to 0.5 in the eighteenth century and falling to 0.4 in the early nineteenth, while the low estimate for the same dates climbs to 0.9 only to fall to 0.6. For sub-Saharan Africa during these two periods, the medium estimate rates would be 0.6 and 0.4 and the low estimate rates 1.1 and 0.6. However, most slaves came from restricted parts of the Atlantic coast of Africa, mostly from Senegal to Angola, with the great majority originating from birthplaces within 500 km of the coast. Assuming these areas to have had about one-third of the sub-Saharan African population, we can calculate rates for the whole four time periods of 0.1, 0.6, 2.5 and 1.8 according to the medium estimates and 0.2, 0.8, 3.1 and 1.9 according to the low estimates. To these should be added extra deaths occasioned by slaving.

Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities.

Similarly, Nguni dynamism was premised upon their ability to incorporate and extract surplus from their large pool of captives. 51 Allowing for local variations, a broad pattern of economic dislocation resulting from the slave trade is nevertheless discernible. The violent disruption of much of the rural economy, the export of many of the most productive members of the indigenous societies, the inadvertent introduction of highly contagious diseases, and the growing dependence of the Central African economy on the world trading system intensified the process of underdevelopment. It is true that this process was accompanied by the dissemination of new crops such as tobacco, maize, rice and cassava, the introduction of modest technological innovations like the Chikunda traps, granaries, and weapons, and the expansion of some local industry. But these were relatively insignificant developments when placed in juxtaposition to the economic retardation of the region as a whole. 52 Little needs to be said about the unprecedented level of destruction that While slavery had been a feature of many Central African societies before the slave trade, preliminary evidence suggests a growing tendency to acquire captives to extract surplus which the aristocracy used to maintain its privileged position.

First, the manner in which slaves were procured tended to destroy social and political structures. Social outcasts, offenders against the law, were sold into slavery. A few persons were sold in times of famine or for debt. But the majority of slaves were apparently taken by kidnapping, raiding and wars. The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda. Accordingly, the extensive influence exercised by the Aro over Igboland through its oracle did not become an integrative force.$^{9}$ The element of violence inherent in Aro addiction to the slave trade thus distinguished their influence from the earlier ritual influ› ence of the Nri people over wide areas of Igboland.\nIn the economic sphere also, the disruption to normal agricultural activities must have been considerable. In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars.

In the freer economies of the early nineteenth century, underpopulation was definitely a factor of under› development.

In those parts of Africa where Africans were not allowed to grow cash crops such as Kenya and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), as Colin Leys has shown, 'within the space of a generation they had effectively been converted from independent peasants, producing cash crops for the new markets, into peasants dependent on agricultural wage-labour'. 27 Sixthly, the commercialization of land already referred to led to the illegal sale of communal lands by unscrupulous family-heads and to increasing litigation over land which caused widespread poverty especially among the ruling houses. In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A common pattern of the movement of cultural forms and their concrete manifestations, the incident provides an apt model of survival, even renewal of cultural values in the face of religious and other more socially intensive forms of domination.

The slave trade had intensified internecine warfare for over two centuries, leading to cultural devastation on an unprecedented scale. Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent. Different methods of foreign control or interaction with the African populace naturally evoked or created different cultural responses from the displaced African.

They created conditions for the truly displaced African in the most literal sense of the word.

Plantation slavery emerged, either in the form of slave settlements in the rural areas managed according to customary law on the Guinea coast, or Islamic law in the Muslim areas, or approximating to American-type plantations in the Indian Ocean islands. With the increased use of people of slave origin as warriors and in administrative positions at various courts, it has been estimated that in many parts of Africa slave populations could range between 25 and 50 per cent of the total population.$^{19}$ Although there were examples of slave revolts, and the particular example of the Lozi who threw off their Kololo overlords,$^{20}$ generally the slave populations did not form a distinct class. The bulk performed menial jobs, largely as agricultural labourers. However the substantial groups of warriors and domestic slaves, and the significant few who rose to positions of trust and power as successful warriors, traders or administrators, and the variations in their fortunes and life styles, made combination as a class of slaves very difficult. Only in places like Old Calabar, where the slaves were permanently alienated, with little inclination to integrate them culturally, and with a tradition of competition among the ruling elite to show off wealth by the number of slaves killed in funeral ceremonies,$^{21}$ did the slaves in the agricultural villages combine in a secret cult to demand improved conditions.

It was a most distressing sight to witness the arrival of these poor creatures; and it is necessary to make a few preliminary remarks in order clearly to understand the difficulties with which the medical officers had to contend. The appearance of the slaves when landed was most striking. In some the expression of the countenance indicated sufferings, moral and physical, of the most profound and agonising nature. Others of them gazed vacantly around them in the most utter helplessness. Occasionally, among the newly-arrived groups all sense of suffering was merged in melancholic or raving madness. The wizened, shrunk, and skinny features were lighted up by the hollow, feverish eye. The belly was, as it were, tacked to the back, whilst the hip-bones protruded, and, in some cases, became the seat of foul, sloughing ulcers. The hand and skinny fingers seemed much elongated by the great and neglected growth of the nails, and they were so deplorably emaciated, that the skin appeared tensely stretched over, and tied down to the skeleton. The legs refused to perform their functions, and they reeled and tottered about from sheer debility. Their squalor and extreme wretchedness was heightened, in many cases, by the particoloured evacuations with which their bodies were besmeared. When large numbers of the sick were suffering from dysentery, the condition of the wards and yards in the morning was extremely loathsome. This was in a great degree unavoidable, as the sick were too weak to crawl from their mats to the commode, although everything was done under the surgeons\' orders to keep the wards as clean and wholesome as the crowded state of the hospital would admit of."" In a word, ""the moral and physical causes of depression were often so overwhelming, and so intensely concentrated, that the combination produced disease in such formidable shapes as to be beyond remedy. The mortality was consequently very great; many persons brought to the hospital in the last stage of disease died a few hours after their arrival; others even expired by the way. A large proportion died within a few days; and as the names of all these persons were recorded in the hospital books, the percentage of deaths was thereby largely increased.""\n\n*(To be continued.)*'}, {'id': 1083, 'article_title': 'FEZ', 'full_section_title': 'FEZ', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1867#article-20', 'issue_date': '23_04_1867', 'content': ""Contrary to the decrees in force, the present Governor, Halim Bey, promotes the commerce in slaves in a most open manner.

Rua, a very large section of country north and west of Cazembe\'s, but still in the same inland region, is peopled by men very like those of Insama and Cazembe. An Arab, Syde Bin Habib, went to trade in Rua two years ago, and as the Arabs usually do where the natives have no guns, Syde Bin Habib\'s elder brother carried matters with a high hand. The Rua men observed that the elder brother slept in a white tent, and, pitching their spears into it by night, killed him. As Moslems never forgive bloodshed, the younger brother forthwith ran amuck on all indiscriminately in a large district. Let it not be supposed that any of these people are like the American Indians—insatiable, bloodthirsty savages, who will not be reclaimed or enter into terms of lasting friendship with fair-dealing strangers. Had the actual murderers been demanded, and a little time been granted, I feel morally certain, from many other instances among tribes who, like the Ba Rua, have not been spoiled by Arab traders, they would all have been given up. The chiefs of the country would, first of all, have specified the crime of which the elder brother was guilty, and who had been led to avenge it. It is very likely that they would stipulate that no other should be punished but the actual perpetrator. Domestic slaves acting under his orders would be considered free from blame. I know of nothing that distinguishes the uncontaminated Africans from other degraded peoples more than their entire reasonableness and good sense. It is different after they have had wives, children, and relatives kidnapped; but that is more than human nature, civilised or savage, can bear. In the case in question indiscriminate slaughter, capture, and plunder took place. A very large number of very fine young men were captured and secured in chains and wooden yokes. I came near the party of Syde Bin Habib, close to the point where a rent in the mountains of Rua allows the escape of the great river Lualaba out of Lake Moero. And here I had for the first time an opportunity of observing the difference between slaves and freemen made captives. When fairly across Lualaba Syde thought his captives safe, and got rid of the trouble of attending to and watching the chained gangs by taking off both chains and yokes. All declared their joy, and perfect willingness to follow Syde to the end of the world or elsewhere, but next morning twenty-two made clear off to the mountains. Many more, on seeing the broad Lualaba roll between them and the homes of their infancy, lost all heart, and in three days eight of them died. The had no complaint but pain in the heart, and they pointed out its seat correctly; though many believe that the heart is situated underneath the top of the sternum or breast-bone. This to me was the most startling death I ever saw. They evidently died of broken-heartedness, and the Arabs wondered, \'seeing they had plenty to eat.\' I saw the others perish, particularly a very fine boy of ten or twelve years of age. When asked if he felt ill he put his hand correctly and exactly over the heart. He was kindly carried, and as he breathed out his soul was laid gently on the side of the path. The captors were not unusually cruel. They were callous—slaving had hardened their hearts. When Syde, who was an old friend of mine, crossed the Lualaba, he heard that I was in a village where a company of slave traders had been furiously assaulted for three days by justly-incensed Babeemba. I would not fight nor allow my people to fire if I saw them, because the Babeemba had been especially kind to me. Syde sent a party of his own people to invite me to leave the village by night, and come to him. He showed himself the opposite of hard-hearted; but slaving \'hardens all within, and petrifies the feelings.\' It is hard for the victims, and for the victimisers.'}, {'id': 2293, 'article_title': 'LETTERS OF DR.

It is excessively troublesome to the wearer, and when marching two yokes are tied together by their free ends, and loads put on the slaves\' heads besides. Women having in addition to the yoke and load a child on the backs, have said to me on passing, \'They are killing me; if they would take off the yoke, I could manage the load and child, but I shall die with three loads.\' One who spoke thus did die, and the poor little girl, her child perished of starvation. I interceded for some; but, when unyoked, off they bounded into the long grass, and I was gently blamed for not caring to preserve the owner\'s property! After a day\'s march under a broiling vertical sun, with yokes and heavy loads, the strongest are exhausted. The party of twelve above mentioned were sitting singing and laughing. Hallo, said I, \'these fellows take to it kindly; this must be the class for whom philosophers say slavery is the natural state;\' and I went and asked the cause of their mirth. I had to ask the aid of their owner as to the cause of their mirth.\n\nmeaning of the word *rukka*, which usually means to fly or leap.

The chorus then struck in was the name of the man who had sold each of them, and then followed the general laugh, in which at first I saw no bitterness. Perembe, an old man, of at least 104 years, had been one of the sellers. In accordance with African belief, they had no doubt of being soon able, by ghost power, to kill even him. Their refrain was—\n\n""Ob, ob, oh!  \nBird of freedom, oh!  \nYou sold me, oh, oh, oh!  \nI shall haunt you, oh, oh, oh!""\n\nThe laughter told not of mirth, but of the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter.

Thetis, the ship which brought the 240 rescued slaves to the Church Missionary Society's new settlement near Mombasa in September last. The letter relates how the poor creatures were rescued from the slave dhow, and how they were handed over to Mr. Price, and being from the commander of the Thetis himself, will no doubt be read with great interest and satisfaction:—\n\nH.M.S. Thetis, at Sea, Sept. 12, 1875.\n\nOn September 9, we were standing leisurely across to Madagascar, under sail, having put our fires out, when a sail was reported from the masthead standing the same way as ourselves. As the wind was light, and there was no chance of coming up with her before night under sail only, I ordered steam to be got up, and about 2 P.M. we were in full pursuit. We did not come up with her until about 5.30, when the number of Arabs on her poop, the absence of colours, and certain erratic movements of her helm, had already raised strong suspicions in our minds against her. The first lieutenant boarded her in one of the cutters, and almost immediately after we had the satisfaction of seeing him take her in tow to bring her to the ship; in short, there was no necessity to ask for papers, for a momentary inspection was sufficient to satisfy the boarding officer that the dhow was a full slaver, so we at once set to work to bring her human cargo on board.\n\nIt was a long business, and by no means an agreeable one, upwards of 300 souls being taken from her hold. Out of this number about sixty were Arabs and crew, and the remainder slaves. She had been only three days out, and therefore it may be supposed that the cargo were in comparatively good condition. Still many of them were in a very emaciated state, and three have died since we received them on board. One poor old woman, whom I found lying on her back in the hold, was at first thought...\n\nto be dead, but on her being lifted up she commenced screaming violently, and struggling with the men who were carrying her out of this pest-house. She is now quite well, and in her right mind. The slaves were stowed on two temporary decks, each about three feet high, the upper one being roofed over with cocoa-nut leaves. Of course the poor creatures could not move from the place where they squatted, and the stench in the lower tier was of such a nature as to make one wonder how any human being could live there for an hour, and yet it would probably have been a full week before they were released had they not fallen in with the Thetis. After clearing her out and taking as much of her provisions as we thought necessary, we set her on fire in several places and put twelve pounds of powder in her hold. In a few minutes we had the satisfaction of seeing this explode, shortly after which this vile craft went to the bottom, never again to carry a living freight.""}, {'id': 4727, 'article_title': 'SLAVE HUNTING IN THE SOUDAN', 'full_section_title': 'SLAVE HUNTING IN THE SOUDAN', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1883#article-23', 'issue_date': '01_11_1883', 'content': 'Mr. Felkin, in his work on Ugundi and the Egyptian Soudan, has given a brief description of a Slave-hunt, or razzia, which we may briefly summarise.

There are various tribes of black men, specially the cannibal Niam-Niams, so graphically described by Dr. Schweinfurth, who are even more fiendlike than the Arabs. Moreover, the slave-hunters\' armies are composed of slaves who are often more ferocious than their captors. When a party of slave-hunters wish to make a raid, they visit some friendly chief, and by presents and promises cajole him to assist them in their terrible work. They then join forces and prepare to attack some neighbouring tribe, whose cattle are to be given to the black and friendly allies, whilst the Arabs carry off the human spoil. Then in the early morning, before the sun has risen, the combined forces steal upon their sleeping and unsuspecting victims. Some of the huts and houses are first fired, and then in the confusion which ensues, the men capable of bearing arms are shot down, and the old of both sexes are butchered with every refinement of cruelty, and all the young men, young women, and children are chained and yoked together to be driven off and sold as slaves. In the long and painful march fresh horrors are of hourly and daily occurrence. Those who fall out of the line, and can no longer drag the heavy and ponderous sheebah, or wooden yoke, are murdered in cold blood or left to perish of hunger. Women, who are nursing, have their babies dashed against a stone before their eyes, as it is known they could not carry their burden for many days. In order to strike terror into a tribe, it is a common practice to seize the headmen, and after burying them up to their necks with their faces towards the fierce African sun, to cut off their eyelids, and leave them to die in torments.

This trade, once inaugurated, was carried on by the Egyptians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and Europeans down to the end of the last century, when the revival of human feeling urged certain philanthropists in England to move towards the abolition of a great evil. But during all this period the negro himself was as much to blame as the white and yellow men; indeed, it was probable that negroes were enslaving negroes long before Egyptian or Arab bought black servants from the negro chiefs, and at the present day there would be no slavery in Africa if an approval of slavery were not present in the philosophy of the negro tribes of Africa. Slavery and the slave trade, with the tribal wars and their attendant insecurity, had been the cause of Africa's backward condition, and if ever that Continent were to be raised to the civilisation of Europe, slavery and the slave trade must be extirpated. The two great slave markets which, until a few years ago, had existed in America, and in Turkey and Persia rendered the inducements to slave traders so great that the guarding of the coasts of Africa by British cruisers only checked the trade in a very slight degree; and even now many slaves were sent to Arabia, Persia, and Madagascar. In the present day, however, Africa was the main consumer of its own slaves. The most remarkable revival of the slave trade and occurred in German East Africa. The Germans, under Major Von Wissmann, began by suppressing a revolt of the Arab slave dealers, which led to the almost complete extinction of the oversea slave traffic on the German coast of East Africa; but the organisation of a strong government led to the rapid settling down of the Arabs as great landed proprietors, with an unlimited number of slaves to work their plantations. Legally slavery could not exist in German territory, but in such a wide and sparsely populated region it was impossible to prevent it in fact; and as the slaves were ordinarily well and kindly treated, it never occurred to them to want to leave their masters or to better their condition. It might be asked where, then, was the harm of slavery? The harm lay in this, that slavery commenced with an initial evil. The speaker then drew a picture of the loss of life, devastation of countries, and breaking of family ties which attended a capture of slaves. This depopulation of whole regions was attended with another evil, the return of the dreaded tsetse fly; and the surest way of extirpating this pest was to encourage population in the fertile districts of Central Africa. They must not expect much from the people themselves.

In the new traffic, organised for the markets of the East, the black that has just been severed from his family and deprived of his liberty, while suffering unheard-of cruelties, must traverse the vast plains of sand which separate the interior of Africa from the borders of the Mediterranean, in order to arrive at the place of his future servile existence.\n\nThe desert, with its scorching sands, devoid of verdure and springs, with its storm-driven dust that buries caravans, seems more terrible than the ocean, and to cross it requires a more lengthened period.\n\nFrom the town of Tripoli to the Lake Tchad, there are nearly twenty degrees—an extent of land more than twice and a half the length of Great Britain. It is by this route that the convoys of negroes are driven by their pitiless masters, condemned, under the burning sun, to the tortures of thirst, hunger and fatigue. It is a long funeral march in the midst of the solitude of the desert.\n\nFrom time to time one of the miserable company falls, to rise no more; his fellow-prisoners make no halt to cover his body even with a little sand. Let it not be supposed that this is a picture of the imagination only. Monsieur Rohlfs, who was an eyewitness of these things during his explorings between the years 1865 and 1867, and who was the first to denounce these mysteries of crime, gives them to us in frightful detail:—\n\n""On both sides of the road,"" he says, ""we see the blanched bones of the victimised slaves—skeletons still covered by the haikoun, the clothing of the blacks. The traveller who knows nothing of the road to Bourno, has only to follow these scattered remains, and he will not be misguided.""\n\nThe merchants take a singular precaution, lest the slave should rob them of a few drops of water: they place the leathern bottle in such a position, that the orifice is turned towards the head of the camel that carries it. The animal, which is itself athirst, begins to cry as soon as the precious vessel is touched, and thus the attempt to partake of its contents would be discovered. Thus thirst, as well as bodily fatigue, has innumerable victims.\n\n* ""The Slave Trade in Africa in 1872. Principally carried on for the supply of Turkey, Egypt, Persia, and Zanzibar.""

Rua, a very large section of country north and west of Cazembe\'s, but still in the same inland region, is peopled by men very like those of Insama and Cazembe. An Arab, Syde Bin Habib, went to trade in Rua two years ago, and as the Arabs usually do where the natives have no guns, Syde Bin Habib\'s elder brother carried matters with a high hand. The Rua men observed that the elder brother slept in a white tent, and, pitching their spears into it by night, killed him. As Moslems never forgive bloodshed, the younger brother forthwith ran amuck on all indiscriminately in a large district. Let it not be supposed that any of these people are like the American Indians—insatiable, bloodthirsty savages, who will not be reclaimed or enter into terms of lasting friendship with fair-dealing strangers. Had the actual murderers been demanded, and a little time been granted, I feel morally certain, from many other instances among tribes who, like the Ba Rua, have not been spoiled by Arab traders, they would all have been given up. The chiefs of the country would, first of all, have specified the crime of which the elder brother was guilty, and who had been led to avenge it. It is very likely that they would stipulate that no other should be punished but the actual perpetrator. Domestic slaves acting under his orders would be considered free from blame. I know of nothing that distinguishes the uncontaminated Africans from other degraded peoples more than their entire reasonableness and good sense. It is different after they have had wives, children, and relatives kidnapped; but that is more than human nature, civilised or savage, can bear. In the case in question indiscriminate slaughter, capture, and plunder took place. A very large number of very fine young men were captured and secured in chains and wooden yokes. I came near the party of Syde Bin Habib, close to the point where a rent in the mountains of Rua allows the escape of the great river Lualaba out of Lake Moero. And here I had for the first time an opportunity of observing the difference between slaves and freemen made captives. When fairly across Lualaba Syde thought his captives safe, and got rid of the trouble of attending to and watching the chained gangs by taking off both chains and yokes. All declared their joy, and perfect willingness to follow Syde to the end of the world or elsewhere, but next morning twenty-two made clear off to the mountains. Many more, on seeing the broad Lualaba roll between them and the homes of their infancy, lost all heart, and in three days eight of them died. The had no complaint but pain in the heart, and they pointed out its seat correctly; though many believe that the heart is situated underneath the top of the sternum or breast-bone. This to me was the most startling death I ever saw. They evidently died of broken-heartedness, and the Arabs wondered, \'seeing they had plenty to eat.\' I saw the others perish, particularly a very fine boy of ten or twelve years of age. When asked if he felt ill he put his hand correctly and exactly over the heart. He was kindly carried, and as he breathed out his soul was laid gently on the side of the path. The captors were not unusually cruel. They were callous—slaving had hardened their hearts. When Syde, who was an old friend of mine, crossed the Lualaba, he heard that I was in a village where a company of slave traders had been furiously assaulted for three days by justly-incensed Babeemba. I would not fight nor allow my people to fire if I saw them, because the Babeemba had been especially kind to me. Syde sent a party of his own people to invite me to leave the village by night, and come to him. He showed himself the opposite of hard-hearted; but slaving \'hardens all within, and petrifies the feelings.\' It is hard for the victims, and for the victimisers.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1872#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SLAVERY AND THE SLAVE-TRADE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""It would be impossible to give more than the barest outline of the efforts of England in Central Africa, unhappily at present so little crowned with success.

A few days since a slave was seized by a number of freemen, and dragged to the beach, close to our mission; they were about tying his legs together, but when they saw me descending the hill, they hurried him into a canoe, which was taken out into the middle of the river; the poor fellow was thrown into the water, but, being a swimmer, he tried to hold the canoe, but was beaten across the head with paddles and sticks. When I saw that they wanted to murder the man, I had my boat got ready, and was just rushing off, when Mr. Thomson came along in his boat. We pulled hard, but the cruel demons of men had broken the skull and marked the water with the man\'s blood; the poor fellow sunk just as Mr. Thomson was about to stretch out his hand to rescue. When the men in the canoe saw him sink, and that we were too late, they gave a savage shout of triumph. They landed amongst a large crowd of people on the beach; I followed them, and told them of their sin, and that it would be remembered against them.""\n\nIn another letter Mr. Smith continues the narrative: ""The slaves, who are powerful in numbers, were very angry, and banded themselves together the following morning and made an attack on the town, driving the freemen and their masters before them. Those who had committed the deed took shelter on mission-ground. The \'country-fashion,\' or superstition house, was burnt down; nearly all the plantain-trees were destroyed and two men wounded. Much consternation and danger prevailed. We were afraid other depredations would occur. Several headmen from A\'kwa town, myself, and two or three members, went amongst them, and got them, after much difficulty, to retire to their own quarters. Much inconvenience was felt by prohibiting the wives of the freemen going to their farms and obtaining food. Many were their threatenings, and it is a mercy no lives were lost; we were amongst them continually, heard their complaints, and sought to satisfy them. In a few days King A\'kwa returned home, had a meeting, and settled the serious palaver. Had the freemen been equally willing to hear us as were the slaves, they would have saved much suffering and the life of the young man would have been saved also.

The whole crowd of the natives present, anticipating the plunder which the wreck would afford, appeared exceedingly anxious that the vessel might run ashore. They jumped for joy, invoking their Fetish to cause the vessel to wreck. After an unsuccessful effort, the crew abandoned the vessel, and came on shore in a small boat with a few bags and boxes containing their clothes; but no sooner did they land on the beach, than a great crowd of natives rushed to the boat and carried off whatever they could lay their hands upon. The owner, John Wood, was himself among the number of his crew, and I understand that his box, containing a large amount of money and other valuables, was carried away by those ruthless people.

It also notes the Muscat Arabs' virtual monopoly on the slave trade from Zanzibar, with the market handling up to 70,000 slaves annually by the 1860s, although these figures may be exaggerated. The Hamerton Treaty of 1847, aimed at banning slave exports beyond the sultan's dominions, underscores the presence of anti-slavery efforts, though it fell short of curbing the demand for slaves. In contrast, The African Times articles provide specific details on the capture of numerous slaves by anti-slavery efforts, such as the liberation of 1,326 slaves by Captain Elton and over 500 by H.M.S. London since October 1880. Prominent figures like Captain Charles J. Brownrigg and Captain F. F. Fegen were involved in these operations, and influential public figures such as Sir Bartle Frere and Sir Thomas Buxton advocated for the trade's suppression. The articles also describe the capture of powerful slave traders like chief Mucuse and the organized nature of slave caravans, involving thousands of armed men and large numbers of slaves. Together, these sources illustrate the extensive and organized nature of the East African slave trade and the significant efforts to combat it.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that support the claim regarding the large-scale and organized nature of the slave trade in East Africa.

By the time Sayyid Said had transferred his economic interest to East Africa, the slave traffic to Mauritius had been reduced by British intervention and the island had even been taken over by them in 1810. But Seyyid Said encouraged the expansion of clove and coconut plantations in Zanzibar and Pemba. By the time he transferred his capital to Zanzibar in the 1840s, clove plantations were already the domi› nant economic activity and were mostly operated by slave labour. This created a class of landowners, originally mainly Arabs, but by the 1860s including indigenous Shirazi and Indians as well. By the 1860s it is estimated that the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba were absorbing about 10 000 slaves per annum. This was in addition to those supplied to other markets (largely Arab) abroad. It has been estimated that by the 1860s the Zanzibar market alone was handling as many as 70 000 slaves per annum and that the heaviest traffic started after 1840.$^{1}$ Although these figures may have been greatly exaggerated, they do indicate that the slave trade has increased tremendously by the middle of the nineteenth century.\nThe second commercial commodity exported from East Africa was ivory. In Chapter 9 we saw how its market was beginning to expand in the first decades of the nineteenth century due to increased demand in the industrialized West, apart from the traditional market in India. Previously Europe and the USA had obtained their ivory from West Africa. The demand for East African ivory, however, increased when it was discovered that it was of better quality (softer) and therefore more suitable for making luxury goods, such as combs, billiard balls and piano keys, which the richer classes were demanding. All British efforts to control this trade directly from East Africa failed because Indian merchants were already well entrenched in conducting the trade through Bombay from where it was re-exported to Europe. Only a few American traders were able to establish themselves gradually in Zanzibar as the most important Western traders, although they remained heavily dependent on the Indian merchants.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The Middle East and south-east Asia 5', 'content': ""Ethiopians were highly prized in Arabia and India on account of their intelligence and appearance.

The slaves were carried in caravans of several hundreds and transported to the Ethiopian coast for shipment at the ports of Berbera, Zeila, Tajura, Assab, Obock and Massawa, from where they were ferried across the Red Sea to the ports of Jeddah, Mocha, and Hoideida.

In the early nineteenth century, Muscat was the greatest clearing house of the traffic to the Gulf, Persia, Irak and India, but as the century wore on its dominance was to be challenged by the port of Sur to the southward. The majority of the slaves landed at Muscat were sold within Oman itself. The rest were bought by agents from the Trucial Coast, notably the Kawâsim, for resale on the coast or in the markets of Persia, Irak, Bahrain, Kuwait, Hasa and Nadj. From Muscat and Sur, slaves were also conveyed to the ports of SindhTKutch, Kathiawar and the Bombay Presidency, in Bahraini, Kuwaiti and Indian bottoms. Those intended for the Persian market were landed at Bushire as well as brought across the Gulf to Lingah from Sharjah.

The Yao penetrated into the Lake Nyasa region during the first half of the century and, after 1850, entered the Shire valley in search of new markets among the Manganja and Chewa. Simultaneously, they established commercial ties to the Indian Ocean port of Ibo, which became a major export centre.

All three groups continued to emphasize the ivory component of the trade as well and in the case of the Bisa traders it remained the dominant export commodity. 26 By the middle of the nineteenth century Central Africa had become a major supplier of slaves. Annual exports from Quelimane to Brazil, for example, had increased by 400 per cent between 1800 and 1835.$^{27}$ The newly developed port of Ibo on Mozambique Island, and Kilwa, were doing a booming business, while the post-1844 resurgence of the sultanate of Angoche was directly related to its entrance into the slave trade, and even the southern Mozambican ports of Inhambane and Lourenço Marques, largely ignored by European slavers, became important sec› ondary entrepôts.$^{28}$ Zanzibar remained the principal recipient of these captives, with annual imports increasing from 10 000 per annum in 1810 to at least 20000 in 1850.$^{29}$ Paralleling this growth was a proportionate increase in ivory exports. 30 As the involvement of Angoche suggests, the economic pre-eminence of the Yao, Chikunda and Bisa did not go unchallenged for long.

It was taken via chains of dealers, or the usual supply channels, to the distribution points.$^{27}$ There again, transactions were governed by well-tried procedures. The price per slave had been fixed in advance in the local money of account, the copper bar, equivalent to a specific quantity of goods - the same as in earlier periods. In 1825 and 1829 men and women were worth 67 bars, and the price went down as low as 45 or 50. In terms of the value of the landed cargo, the price per slave was 33 Spanish dollars, of which 8-10 per cent went to the distributors by way of commission. At Duke Town, Duke Ephraim's city in Old Calabar, the heads of other more or less rival houses, Egbo Eyo, Tom Honesty and Ogan Henshaw, helped to make up cargoes with slaves or foodstuffs. Forty thousand yams cost 2000 bars, the price of forty slaves. Around 1830 the biggest share of the trade was reputedly carried on at Bonny. 28 Estimates of the volume of the slave trade during the sixty years of the abolitionist period can only be in terms of orders of magnitude.

Their learned observation endorses the popular view. But the proposition needs explanation. Humanitarianism is a Western ideology, and it is unlikely to have found any place in the minds of African distributors of the time - with very rare exceptions. But this does not mean that they were constitutionally incapable of giving up the trade, as Western supporters of slavery maintained. The continuance of the supply of exportable manpower from Africa can be logically explained in economic terms. That the distributors were black and the exporters white is irrelevant: it was a paying proposition, profitable to both trading partners, whose sole object was to make money. That was the situation at the grass roots. The continuance of the supply is to be explained in terms of the efficient working of an integrated system: and what Africans were resisting was the disruption of this system. For one thing, it would have ruined the established business of the distributors,$^{31}$ who had no other prospects, to say nothing of the chain of repercussions it would have set off on the social and political structure, both locally and further afield. In other words, so long as the barter system between the hinterland and the coast, and the coast's foreign trade, had no clear alternative to the slave trade, opposition by African slave-traders to its suppression was dictated strictly by the imperative needs to avoid commercial chaos.$^{32}$ The supposed complicity of the African distributors was no more than a reflex reaction to the immediate economic situation. This also explains the fall in the selling price of exportable manpower: it was the market's defence against growing pressure from the forces of suppression. The latter thus helped to contribute to an unsatisfactory situation. This argument needs to be modi› fied when the exportation of Africans to the north or east is considered. While the economic interests of the slave hunters and distributors are selfevident in this case too, it is hard to see what kind of economic compensa› tion accrued to the countries that were plundered.

This interaction of peoples of varied backgrounds merits further study. 10 The annual pilgrimage to Mecca also played an important, albeit a seasonal, role in the involuntary and voluntary movements of Africans to the Middle East. Many West African pilgrims reached Mecca via the Cairo caravan or by way of the Red Sea ports of Suäkin and Massawa, thereby constituting small diaspora communities."" Ever since the time of the great Malian King, Mansa Müsä, such wealthy African pilgrims were \'accompanied by a number of slaves, some of whom [they sell] on the way as a kind of traveller\'s cheque - to pay the expenses of [their] journey\'. 12 Therefore it was no accident that Mecca emerged as the chief market in the Arabian peninsula.

In areas dominated by British and Dutch colonial powers, especially in India and the Malay archipelago, slaves, including Africans, provided the base of a plantation economy similar to that found in the Americas.

Indecisiveness by the abolitionists left Portugal and Brazil to carry on the illicit trade south of the Equator at their leisure, and exportation was sometimes as high as in the eighteenth century.

Elsewhere, the prevalent ethos was acculturation and integration into the society through individual households. While the degree of integration was clearly limited - as witnessed by the number anxious to be redeemed or, having been emancipated by colonial laws, who were anxious to return to their original homes - it was real enough to suggest that the dynamics of change in most of the African communities was the tension of age and sex within each household, and of status and competition for power between the lineages and kinship groups, rather than between broad classes in society.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Abolitionist ideology was not African in inspiration.

In Dahomey, on the other hand, the slave trade was one of the mainstays of the ruling house, which delegated the running of it to its chief vassals. In 1818 King Gezo, who was in debt to the Brazilian mulatto Francisco Felix Da Souza, appointed Da Souza as chacha, a 'white-man's chief who acted as an economic adviser and administrator of the Whydah trade. This office survived the death of the first chacha in 1849 and was inherited by Da Souza's son. It was management on a grand scale: the chachas kept a stock of Western goods, offset bookkeeping debits and credits, prepared cargoes in advance to facilitate speedy loading, collected taxes, checked the movements of white foreigners, and provided entertainment for their customers. This economic apparatus was capable of being adapted to other types of produce. Produce for the slave trade, which was in the hands of the chiefs, was secured by annual military expeditions, not always victorious, against the neighbouring countries, principally the Yoruba. It also came from the Central Sudan - whence captives were distributed, moreover, to the north and to Egypt - by caravans, which split up their loads at the border: the blacks earmarked for export, who were strong, were kept aside and incorporated in the ordinary porterage teams.$^{25}$ Further east, from Badagry to the borders of the kingdom of Benin, prolonged strife among the Yoruba people glutted the Whydah market.

The main sources of supply, however, were not only the great djihäd conducted by the Muslim leaders of the north and the conflicts in Mossi territory. The trade was also fed from a host of channels that sluiced off slaves from peoples belonging to hundreds of chieftaincies, from the territories of the Tuareg to the areas bordering the trading posts on the coast.

Captain Woodward was informed by Mr. Holmwood, Consul-General, that of the 13 Arabs on board the dhow nine were the most notorious slave dealers in Pemba, and in all there were upwards of 20 armed men, the arms being Snider rifles and swords. Of the 13 Arabs, 11 were killed, and two succeeded in reaching the shore, one of whom died subsequently of his wounds, and the other escaped, but measures have been adopted for his capture. During the action four of the boat's crew were severely wounded, one of whom has since died. The following are the names of the crew: Frederick J. Russell, captain, mizen top (wounded); Joseph E. Greep, leading seaman; Henry Ward, A.B.; Benjamin E. Stone, A.B. (dead); Thomas Hall, A.B. (wounded); Frederick Blanchard, A.B.; John W. Pearson, A.B.; James J. Blyth, private R.M. (wounded). On receipt of Captain Woodward's despatch, it was laid before the Lords of the Admiralty, who, to mark their appreciation of the gallantry displayed, have promoted Lieut. Fegen to Commander, and Russell and Greep to warrant officers. The other seamen are to be advanced to petty officers' ratings if they possess the necessary qualifications, and the marine to corporal.""}]","[{'document_title': 'Meeting at the Mansion House, London, respecting the Slave Trade in East Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""An influential public meeting has been held at the Mansion House in relation to the East African slave trade, and to concert measures for its entire suppression.\n\nSir Bartle Frere, upon whom the Lord Mayor called, in moving the first resolution, said that the slave trade, which had been suppressed in the West Indies, was carried on with vigour on the East Coast of Africa, and partly under the unconscious protection of the British Government. Before we had anything to do directly with the government of India, or any colonies in Africa, there was an immense trade, and healthy and vigorous, which had been going on for ages between East Africa and India. The early navigators tell that they found there considerable freedom, a certain amount of civilisation, and a very large amount of trade with India. A century after that the country had been for the greater part occupied by the Portuguese, in some part by Englishmen, and its commerce and prosperity had declined. Something had been done since then to revive a legitimate trade there, and there was a very considerable trade with other countries in Europe. That trade was capable of enormous development. The unhealthy districts were all on the coast. The interior was well-watered and healthy, and yet the inhabitants had been swept from it within living memory by the slave trade. Large regions had been depopulated, and that was the state in which it was now found. It was since we made ourselves masters of the Indian seas that the slave trade had grown to its present dimensions. It must now be put down. The meeting would, therefore, respectfully urge upon Her Majesty's Government to take steps for the prompt abrogation of those treaties, and to carry out in other respects the recommendations embodied in the report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons to secure an entire abolition of the slave trade in Eastern Africa.\n\nSir Thomas Buxton, who seconded the resolution, said the slave trade papers had from year to year contained a mass of information on the subject, furnished by captains and others, which left no doubt that a tremendous evil was going on; but at present there was little excuse for the ignorance that existed on the subject. Zanzibar was the port through which the trade was carried on. In many cases we had treated the native states of Zanzibar very much in the way we treated the native states of India. We had interfered in their political affairs and their internal arrangements. That and other circumstances showed we had a certain authority in that port and in the islands about it, and if that evil of the slave trade continued, the world would hold us responsible for it in a great degree."", 'last_edit_date': '1872-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1872#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East and Central Africa Foreign Slave Trade', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sometimes the wind causes the mouths of the wells to be filled with sand. When this is the case, some of the negroes, not having sufficient strength to wait until the needed clearance is made, die; and their companions have barely the strength to remove the corpses.\n\nThe traveller whose name we have before mentioned, relates that he met with a certain spring surrounded with what might emphatically be called a field of the dead: there bones were laid about in heaps. His servants, who had drawn water from this spring, without observing it, carried off in the bucket the skull of a man. These human skeletons, mingled as they are with the bones of the lower animals, are the remains of slaves.\n\nOn leaving these frightful solitudes, where man is proved to be more merciless than the desert, reaching the zone of the forests, the eye is rejoiced at the sight of rich vegetation, flowers and lakes, these latter giving to the soil an endless source of fertility.\n\nBut in the midst of Nature, which God has made so rich, sorrowful reflections come over the mind. This privileged land is the theatre of slavery, and the home of the man-hunter. The large city of Kouka, in the vicinity of Lake Tchad, the capital of Bornou, is one of the greatest marts for this human merchandise.\n\nOn the Square, the best adapted for the slave-markets, one is sure every day to find several hundreds; but on Monday, the great sale day, they may be numbered by thousands; the blacks are there exhibited in their pitiable plight, partially covered with miserable tatters. The wholesale merchants and connoisseurs have no need to be attracted by a more delicate exposition, such as that which one would meet with in a retail purchase.\n\nThe slave is examined with care, taking measure of his height, opening his mouth, counting his teeth, asking questions about his appetite, &c., &c. The price demanded is according to his age, strength and colour of the prisoner, and varies from half a sovereign to five pounds for the current merchandise. Is this all that a man is worth, and is this the estimate put on human liberty? There are other markets at which the slave is considered of still less value.\n\nBut whence come all these wretched beings? It is here that the Eastern traffic is presented to us under a particular aspect, such as it did not assume on the western coasts of Africa in the organised commerce of slaves. Man-hunting, which supplies the victims for these markets, is not only encouraged by the brutal ferocity of the chief of a tribe; it is considered an act commanded by religion.\n\nThe Sultan, who goes to make razzias at the head of warriors, with whom he divides the booty, by an impious aberration believes that he performs a pious work in spreading devastation around him.

The market is with them a great institution, and they work hard and carry far in order to have something to sell. Markets are established about ten or fifteen miles apart. There those who raise cassava, maize, grain, sweet potatoes, exchange them for oil, salt, pepper, fish, and other relishes; fowls, also pigs, goats, grass-cloth, mats, and other articles change hands. All are dressed in their best—gaudy-colored, many-folded kilts that reach from the waist to the knee. When 2,000 or 3,000 are together they enforce justice, though chiefly women, and they are so eager traders they set off in companies by night, and begin to run as soon as they come within the hum arising from hundreds of voices. To haggle, and joke, and laugh, and cheat, seems to be the dearest enjoyment of life. They confer great benefits upon each other. The Bazenya women are expert divers for oysters, and they sell them and fish for farinaceous food from the women on the east of the Lualaba, who prefer cultivating the soil to fishery. The Manyuema have always told us that women going to market were never molested. When the men of two districts were engaged in actual hostilities the women passed through from one market to another unharmed; to take her goods, even in war, was a thing not to be done. But to these market women the half-caste directed their guns. Two cases that came under my own observation were so sickening, I cannot allow my mind to dwell upon or write about them. Many of both sexes were killed, but the women and children chiefly were made captives. No matter how much ivory they have obtained, these ""Nigger Moslems"" must have slaves, and they assaulted the markets and villages, and made captives, chiefly, as it appeared to me, because, as the men ran off at the report of guns, they could do it without danger. I had no idea before how bloodthirsty men can be when they can pour out the blood of fellow-men in safety. And all this carnage is going on in Manyuema at the very time I write. It is the Banians, our protected Indian fellow-subjects, that indirectly do it all. We have conceded to the Sultan of Zanzibar the right, which it was not ours to give, of a certain amount of slave trading, and that amount has been from 12,000 to 20,000 a-year. As we have seen, these are not traded for, but murdered for. They are not slaves, but free people made captive. A Sultan with a sense of justice would, instead of taking head money, declare that all were free as soon as they reached the territory. But the Banians have the customhouse and all the Sultan\'s revenue entirely in their hands. He cannot trust his Muhammadan subjects, even of the better class, to farm his income, because, as they themselves say, he would get nothing in return but a crop of lies. The Banians naturally work the custom-house so as to screen their own slaving agents; and so long as they have the power to promote it, their atrocious system of slavery will never cease. For the sake of lawful commerce it would be politic to insist that the Sultan\'s revenue by the custom-house should be placed in the hands of an English or American merchant of known reputation and uprightness. By this arrangement the Sultan would be largely benefited, legal commerce would be exalted to a position it has never held since Banians and Moslems emigrated into Eastern Africa, and Christianity, to which the slave trade is an insurmountable barrier, would find an open door.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1872#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'PARLIAMENTARY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Lord STRATHEDEN (the consistent enemy of the abominable slave trade in East Africa) moved an address to Her Majesty, praying that such measures as were necessary to assist the cruisers employed in the repression of the slave trade on the eastern coast of Africa might be adopted.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1872#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East and Central Africa Foreign Slave Trade', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The accusation is a solemn one.

In order to understand the abominations connected with the Eastern slave trade, we must rid ourselves of our European ideas, and enter a new world, in which men and events have in store for us more than one subject of surprise.\n\nIt is easy to form an opinion as to the importance of this slave traffic in this region, when we know the extent of the caravans that convey the negroes from Kouka. During many weeks, the preparations and the departure fill the capital with noise and bustle. Long files of camels are laden with provisions, two thousand armed men serve as an escort, and the human flock altogether counts four thousand heads. For the Sultan, for his horsemen, for his wholesale merchants, for the entire city, the caravan season is a great annual festivity; for the slave, it is the moment of banishment, the renewal of sufferings, and perhaps the eve of his death. Very speedily all this multitude has taken a northern direction, and soon it disappears from the side of the desert.\n\nBut this crowd of unhappy beings, these miserable creatures of all ages—children, young men, old men and women—where are they going? What agricultural or industrial labour demands them from the Eastern coast? What route will they take, since the north of Africa, the borders of the Mediterranean, belong to those Powers which proscribe the traffic?

I had been superintending the issue of loads and departure of the caravan from camp, and was just overtaking the head of the Safari, when I met two or three suspicious-looking men with guns, and saw others skulking in the forest. I did not at once perceive the situation, but noticed the embarrassment of the men, the presence of several very young children (infants) which they were carrying, and that the caravan, instead of passing us in the broad path, was disappearing man by man as they came up into the jungle. I demanded the reason for these things and accused them of being a slave caravan, which they strongly denied. I took away their guns and made them prisoners till I should prove the truth of their words, and sent Mr. Wilson on ahead to ascertain what he could, and capture any if he found they were a slave caravan. Mr. de Winton searched the bush, and I returned to the rear of the Safari to send word back to Shukri and the search party (who had returned to our previous camp to look for the missing Soudanese) to be on the look out and capture all they could. We found it was undoubtedly a slave caravan. The headman in front says he saw fifteen girls in slave sticks, and we captured and liberated one man in a slave stick, and also found one woman slave and three young children, two being emaciated with starvation. These I took on with me, together with a number of prisoners we captured. The common porters I released (taking away their arms), and retained two men of superior rank and a boy as evidence. These men I sent down to the coast under Mr. Auburn\'s charge as prisoners from the Kibwezi, together with full details and evidence gathered from them and from the other prisoners whom I had released as to the names of the owners and leaders of the caravan, &c.

Sir Bartle Frere and other equally distinguished modern advocates of the abolition of the slave trade, have been driven by their own experience to advance the same view; and the chief purpose of Mr. Cooper\'s book is to submit—which we think he does conclusively—that, were our Government to take up the question in earnest, the task of inducing Mohammedan Powers to abolish slavery would prove less difficult than is alleged.\n\n""The principal countries on behalf of which the present African slave trade is carried on are Turkey, Egypt, Persia, Tunis, Morocco, and Madagascar.

How is it, then, that the slave trade is still carried on in those countries, in violation both of law and treaty engagements?

Captain Elton\'s first batch of letters, dated February 10-23, relate to his visit to the Samanga district, and here he liberated 1,326 slaves, with the option of remaining with their former masters or gaining an independent livelihood by their own exertions. Regarding this district, he says that slave-holding and dealing in slaves are now so completely upset and pronounced to be illegal, and so severely do such transactions expose the Indian to direct pecuniary loss through repudiation on the part of those he may be doing business with, that a total abandonment of all commerce with the traffic must result if the present vigilance is maintained; for in such case the one tie between the Arab and Swahili and the Indians being severed, the latter in sheer defence is compelled to look for justice and protection to the British power. As formerly carried on, the Indian connection with the slave traffic was mainly represented by three classes of traders—viz.: 1. The Custom House officials, who received the duties on slaves, and were often willing partners in large ventures. 2. The well-to-do merchants, who advanced guns, cloth, beads, and money to Arabs and Waswahili, and also to the third class. 3. The smaller Khojah and Battiah speculators, who traded in slaves in the immediate neighbourhood, and supplied goods to Mrima kidnappers and other riff-raff of the Coast at an enormous rate of interest. Of these classes, the first is out of work, as no duty is paid on slaves, either to the Custom House, the Sultan, or the local authorities; and the wealthier Battiahs are now too fearful of detection to engage in such dangerous work as supporting the dealers. The second has suspended operations of late; but the third, tempted by high and immediate profits, continues operations on a reduced scale. As a specimen of the trade carried on by the third class, Captain Elton describes the case of a Battiah, who, during his temporary absence, had four slaves brought into Kilwa by a party of his own men (freed only a few days previously), and deliberately sold the whole four to a caravan leaving for Pangani. ""His defence,"" says Captain Elton, ""was that he gave his men cloth to trade for ivory only, and that, instead of obeying orders, they bought slaves, whom they sold to repay him for the loss of his goods. This defence was simply ridiculous. Ivory is not to be so readily purchased just beyond the town, and, moreover, the Battiah accompanied his men to the house of the public auctioneer, quarrelled over the price offered there, and subsequently sold directly to the leader of the gang, leaving the next morning, for a higher sum. Unfortunately it was too late to recover the slaves, but I inflicted a fine of 400 dollars, trying the case with assessors, one of whom was a prominent man of the offenders\' own religious sect.""

From Dar-es-Salaam the caravan route was followed, via Kisiju and the Kwale settlements, to Kilwa Kivinje, and the copal fields, and the Rufiji river (struck at the Fords of Mpenbwe), reported on. All the Mungao trading stations on the coast were next inspected in Her Majesty\'s ship Daphne, as far south as Mkindani Bay, the Rovuma settlement being deserted in consequence of local disturbances. A month was occupied in Kilwa and its vicinity, and subsequently Kondachi and the towns on the Mrima opposite to Zanzibar were visited. The annexed return will show the practical results—1,409 slaves have been registered and freed; 499 of whom have commenced life anew; 920 remained with former masters, and I believe a very heavy blow has been struck at the slave trade. Some few cases of concealment have necessarily escaped detection, but the scandal of slave-holding by British subjects on the 300 miles of sea-board travelled over may be considered virtually at an end, although it cannot be disguised that occasional inspection and prompt punishment in cases of offence against the law will be necessary to prevent matters gradually sliding back into the old groove. Active support and money-lending for the purposes and ends of the traffic by the better class of Khojah and Battiah merchant has beyond doubt ceased; neither, do I think, will it be renewed. The pains and penalties attached to complicity with the trade are known to all, and the Indian will hesitate before placing himself in the power of the Arab and Swahili, who can at any moment repudiate his debts and procure his creditors punishment. One of the results of the policy adopted has been to throw the Indian merchants more completely under our protection; their only link with the Arab Government being broken, a strong anxiety is evinced for increased consular superintendence of the coast and a suppression of the injustice exercised by the local authorities.""', 'last_edit_date': '1874-08-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_08_1874#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'REVIEW.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Slave Catching in the Indian Ocean.

Not that it is by any means perfect, for it has very grave defects. There is too much matter only incidentally connected with the work, set forth in the title; and the author has been led into very serious error when he refers to West Africa as affording evidence in support of some of his arguments and propositions, which we expect will meet with severe handling by our anti-Slavery friends. Our own abhorrence of that loathsome thing—the East African Foreign Slave Trade—is so deep and entire, that any at- tempts to diminish the just indignation aroused by the but-too- well authenticated records of its atrocities, has a painful effect on our mind; and there are such attempts in Captain Colomb\'s ""Slave-Catching in the Indian Ocean."" If, therefore, we re- commend the book, notwithstanding what we condemn in it, our friends will understand that we regard it as containing some- thing outweighing its demerits. The preliminary matter extends over above 100 pages. It is only at page 112 that our author leaves Bombay on his slave-catching cruise. His notices of the Arab towns and coast extend to page 184. There the real action of the book begins. The author describes five ships appointed to that season\'s Slave Trade suppression in the Indian Ocean, as being so placed, and having such cruising ground, that they formed what might be called a spider web for entangling the guilty Arab dhows. H.M.S. Dryad, under the command of Captain Colomb, R.N., formed the northern lines of this web; and here the volume becomes one of great interest to those who have at heart the entire suppression of the East African Foreign Slave Trade.

Sturge (Chairman of the Anti-Slavery Society), and a number of clergy and laymen intimately and personally acquainted with the horrors of the African slave-trade. The Chairman said that the English people were at heart sound in maintaining the view held by our forefathers with respect to the iniquity of slavery. It was supposed by some that slavery was abolished, but that was far from being the fact. Although from the West Coast of Africa there was not as large an exportation of slaves as there used to be, still there was a very large exportation from the East Coast, and there was a great deal of slavery on the continent of Africa itself. Another field of slavery was Brazil, and the President of the Anti-Slavery Society and some colleagues were working in order to redeem that country from the taint of slavery. They were looking forward very hopefully to the day when Brazil would no longer be a slave country. Slavery also existed in Egypt. It was not in connection with agriculture that the slavery in Egypt prevailed, but it was associated with their domestic relations, the slaves being used in the household as servants, and purchased by wealthy persons as members of their harems. The Anti-Slavery Society hoped that the position of England in Egypt was such that her influence could be used to do away with all slavery in that country. The Society had been cordially supported by Lord Granville, and they had the entire sympathy of Lord Dufferin, who had expressed the view that it might be possible to introduce the seven years' system, so that at the end of seven years the slave-trade of Egypt might be abolished. Lord Granville, on the other hand, looking at the state of the Soudan, asked whether it would not be possible at once to make an end of slavery. The Society would use their influence to support the view of Lord Granville. They hoped that the great influence of England in Egypt would not be used to retain in power any Government which still permitted man to hold in captivity his fellow-man. Arrangements had been made for Mr. Baker to go to the Soudan to represent the Government in that portion of Egypt. He would have the power not merely to remain at Khartoum, but to act as a roving consul in that district; and from him the Government would be able to obtain full information of all that was going on. There were many other districts which needed to be carefully watched by the society. They hoped to see gradually developed among the nations of the world the civilization which Englishmen enjoyed, and, by the abolition of slavery, to remove one of the greatest barriers to the success of missionary work and the spread of the Gospel. The Rev. Horace Waller (late of South Africa, and a friend of Dr. Livingstone) gave details of the slave-trade in Africa, and said that it was now more rampant than ever in the centre and on the Eastern Coast of Africa. The Rev. C. T. Wilson (late of Uganda) spoke of the horrors of the slave-trade, as did also Archdeacon Farler (of Zanzibar), who said that he was greatly surprised at the ignorance of intelligent persons on the subject of slavery, many of them believing that it had been entirely put down by the English Government."", 'last_edit_date': '1883-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1883#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'East African Slave Trade', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Officials. As shown by my previous reports, slaves continue to be marched up from Kilwa, almost daily and by hundreds, over the Kisuju-road, North, destined for Zanzibar, Pemba, Lamu, and Brava. Smuggling is rife from all the Mrima between Mboamaji and Waseen, and preparations, it is said, are made on a large scale to run, with the change of monsoon, to Arabia and the Persian Gulf. The transport by sea has, in fact, been replaced by the inland route. The removal of all Customs duties is an advantage to the dealer. Formerly he had to pay 2 dols. 50c. to the Sultan\'s dues on each slave, besides chartering a vessel at a heavy rate, for which freight was paid in advance, and in order to get clear of Kilwa, was compelled to borrow money at a ruinous rate. He was invariably in debt in former days; now he finds himself working on his own capital. After the treaty, he at once repudiated his accounts with the Indian merchant, and as an experiment marched his slaves to the north, where he sold them at a large profit, returned by sea to Kilwa, and was able to take advantage of the immense rise in prices owing to the demand for labour in Pemba. As a result, the slave-trader who a year ago was heavily in debt and trammelled in every way, is now a capitalist, and able to pay cash for the goods required to equip his next large venture towards the Nyassa or the country at the back of the Upper Rufiji. He no longer asks for credit, and it is not the merchant\'s business to inquire whether his ready-money customer is engaged in the traffic. At Brava and Lamu slaves are in large demand, and Pemba is still unsatisfied; neither will Arabia and the Persian Gulf be contented to forego their usual supplies. Hence it is positive every encouragement is given to reckless smuggling. Should ventures from these ports succeed, a large access of capital will be the result; but even if they fail, sufficient capital is in hand from the immense profits of the past year to carry on the trade in 1874-75.

Our trade with the West Coast of Africa had gone on since the time of the Tudors. For centuries that trade was in slaves, and its increase was slow; but after several blows had been struck at that trade—among others by the liberation of slaves in the West Indian Islands, in America, and in Cuba—instead of their being any injury done to our commerce, our trade with the West Coast of Africa increased by leaps and bounds. It was only in 1850 or shortly after that we attacked a great nest of slave dealers in Lagos, and in 1861 it was made a British colony. Up to that time there had been no trade there except in slaves; but last year the trade of Lagos amounted to £357,831 imports, and £538,980 exports. And yet only thirty-eight years ago that place was of absolutely no value to us for legitimate commerce. On the Gold Coast slavery had been practically abolished by the British Government, but yet there was a good deal still existing owing to the native customs of the people. Even if the export of slaves from Africa was prevented entirely, the internal trade in them would still be enormous.\n\nFormerly the slave trade was subsidiary to the ivory trade, but when porters were no longer wanted for the latter, the former remained, only the men were killed and the women and children carried away. It had been said that domestic slavery must be allowed, and that was a very difficult question to settle. In his opinion, we should, as in India, abolish the legal status of slavery, but should not rout out all the households where no complaint was made. As long as domestic slavery existed there would be a market for slaves. We must have nothing to do with slavery; while the slave trade continued it was impossible for legitimate commerce to go on as it should! If the slave trade were done away with, they would find that all other trade would flourish.\n\nIn answer to questions Commander Lovett Cameron said he had avoided speaking of the Germans for diplomatic reasons.\n\nHe had a plan for the total abolition of slavery in Africa, which he hoped to explain shortly. It was, in brief, to establish a barricade across the country by the way of the lakes, and to get authority to maintain order on that line.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, on February 26, presided over a large meeting, held in Exeter Hall, when two African explorers, Commander Cameron and Captain Hore, were announced to speak.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-03-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_03_1889#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""The difficulty was that subsistence farmers had few needs and often felt that regular employment savoured of slavery$^{5 6}$ and that these tasks were women's work.$^{57}$ Europeans, frustrated by seeing large profits slipping away from them, had little sympathy with such attitudes: 'fear had to take the place of ambition or covetousness as the motive sentiment inducing them to labour'.$^{58}$ The solutions were primitive and often brutal. For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces.

A more accurate judgement in this writer's opinion is not that colonialism did not do anything positive for Africa, it indeed did. But Europeans did make huge profits in Africa through mining companies, trading houses, banks, shipping lines, plantations and concession companies. Moreover governments held substantial foreign reserves from the colonies in metropolitan countries which must have provided some of the capital for metropolitan development. Finally, metro› politan industries benefited from cheap raw materials obtained from the colonies and profits made from the export of manufactured goods. When all this is compared with what the African owners of the land, peasant agriculturalists and mine labourers obtained, and the fact that whatever infrastructural and social facilities that were provided had to be paid for by the colonies themselves, one cannot but marvel at the raw deal which colonialism thrust on Africans. Moreover, whatever colonialism did for Africans in Africa, given its opportunities, its resources and the power and influence it wielded in Africa at the time, it could and should have done far more than it did. As even Lloyd admits: 'So much more might perhaps have been done had the development of backward territories been seen by the industrial nations as a first priority'.$^{49}$ It is precisely because colonial rulers not only did not see the development of Africans as their first priority, but did not see it as a priority at all that they stand condemned.

As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ...

They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

The first of these was the creation and widening of the gap between the urban centres and rural areas that developed during the colonial period. The phenomenal growth of the population of the urban centres that we noted above was not the result of the natural increase of the urban population but rather of what has been described as 'push-pull forces',$^{32}$ the continuous pull of young men and women to the urban centres by the need for education and employ› ment and the push from the rural areas, as C. Coquery-Vidrovitch has shown above (Chapter 15), by famine, epidemic, poverty and taxation. Moreover, since the Europeans tended to live in the urban centres, all those facilities that improved the quality of life enumerated above were established only in those areas. The rural areas were therefore virtually neglected, which, in turn, accentuated the drift from one to the other. A huge gap exists even today between urban and rural areas in Africa and there is no doubt that it was the colonial system that originated and widened this gap.\nNor did the migrants find the urban centres the safe and rich haven that they had expected. In no town were the Africans accepted as equals and fully integrated. Moreover, nowhere did a majority of them find jobs or decent accommodation.

Though there were European settlers in the North African states and in South Africa before the colonial era, there is no doubt that not only did the number of these people increase but European and Asiatic settlers were also introduced into East and Central Africa and parts of West Africa during the colonial days. As M. H. Y. Kaniki has shown above (Chapter 16), the number of Europeans in Kenya rose from only 596 in 1903 to 954 in 1905, to 5438 in 1914 and to 16663$^{ m x}$9$^{2}$9;$^{tnat m}$ Southern Rhodesia increased from 11000 in 1901 to over 35000 by 1926,$^{33}$ and that in Algeria from 344000 in 1876 to 946000 in 1936. But in many areas in East, Central and North Africa, what made their presence so inimical to Africans was that the Europeans came to occupy most of the fertile lands, while the Asiatics monopolized the retail and wholesale trade. In West Africa, too, the Asiatics - Syrian, Lebanese and Indians - whose population increased from only 28 in 1897 to 276 in 1900, 1910 in 1909, 3000 in 1929 and to 6000 by 1935 also drove out their African competitors.

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure.

These have remained in many areas and underlie some of the civil wars and rivalries that have occurred in some independent African states. The neglect of higher education and technical training also compelled some Africans who could afford to do so, to send their children to the metropolitan countries as well as to the United States, and it was such people who, partly from their varying experiences of racial discrimination and, even more important still, their deeper appreciation of the evil nature of the colonial system, became on their return, as will be shown in the next volume, the most bitter critics of the system and the leaders of the anti-colonial or nationalist movements.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.725, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'The persistence and transformation of African cultural values in Latin America and the Caribbean', 'content': ""The forms of resistance already noted during the colonial period, when small numbers of fugitive slaves including half-castes banded together and attempted to live outside the system imposed by the colonizer, emerged in the late eighteenth century.

This integration is revealed in a variety of ways, encompassing the songs of African religious groups in Cuba and Brazil, the rhythm of African instruments$^{74}$ which were effectively incor› porated in the musical culture, the art of African cooking, the utilization of certain African techniques as, for example, in Haiti, the use of agricultural implements such as the hoe among others, and the transmission of religious values and philosophies of life.

African dance, art, music and traditional religious systems held their own and such borrowings and adaptations as were made by Africans were not only selective but also, to borrow M. J. Herskovits' terminology, 'additive' and not necessarily 'substitutive'. 56 Thus, in the rural areas and even to some extent in the urban ones, new beliefs, new gods, new utensils, new artefacts and new objects were added to the old ones. Certainly, in these areas, many Christians did and still do retain their belief in their traditional gods. Indeed, in the field of religion, if anything, it was the European religion that was rather Africanized as is obvious from the rituals, hymns, music and even doctrines of some of the syncretic and millenarian churches and not the other way round. What is even more important, the ground that was lost even in the urban centres in the field of culture has virtually been regained. Today, African art, music and dance are not only taught in educational institutions of all kinds but are now in boom in Africa and gaining recognition in Europe.

We have four seats of government there: Sierra Leone, now as chief, with Bathurst, Cape Coast, and Lagos. We need not insist that education is absolutely necessary to this progress. We might as well set about demonstrating that food and drink are indispensable to the support of animal life. To build up a civilised nation without first creating an educated class is a moral impossibility. In such a class alone can the seed of civilisation germinate, and by it alone can this new principle of life be developed. When, therefore, the declared enemies and traducers of Africa set forth that education there is an engine of demoralisation, we cast aside the ignorant assertion with the contempt it deserves. They might as well pretend to maintain that the antecessarian inhabitants of these islands, with their paint and feathers, their human sacrifices, and other superstitious abominations, were a nobler people, and presented a more agreeable object for contemplation, than the present British subjects of Queen Victoria. Let us have done at once and for ever with these perverse and contemptible absurdities, and look the educational position and requirements of West Africa boldly in the face. We cannot get rid of the solemn obligation that rests upon us by ignoring or evading it. There it is; and it will crop up more and more as we neglect it. Enough has been done, in despite, we may say, of the Government—and shame it is that we should have reason to say it—to make it impossible for us to recede. With the Christian part of it we have happily nothing to do. Our noble Missionary Societies have taken care of that. By their devoted exertions a certain amount of education, coupled happily with religious teaching, has been bestowed. The Anthropologists say this has brought in added vices instead of new virtues. This is a foul falsehood. Civilised vices there are, no doubt, as there are in Great Britain, but such as they are, they are a step in advance of the savage native abominations, and come not with the missionaries, but have been introduced and propagated by Anthropologists and their admirers and adherents, slave-traders, believers in Mohammedan perfection, lovers of Mohammedan indulgencies, and enemies of Christianity and its blessed precepts. We do not look to them for the solution of the problem of African material and moral regeneration even; for if we did, we should look in vain. We might as well expect to find the sewage-fouled mud of our polluted river-shores producing precious gems. We must look to other sources, and we can find these nowhere else but in a continuance and increase of Christian teaching combined with adequate means of education first introduced and supported by Government. We do not wish to alarm the Treasury or the House of Commons. We know that in the present temper of our executive, and of prominent public politicians of all parties as regards Africa, there is no hope for us in them now; nor do we see ground for such hope during long, long years to come, unless the really Christian portion of our population awake to their great responsibility, and combine to give practical Christianity, its precepts and its duties, their proper share of influence in the councils of this nation. Meanwhile let us deal with things as we find them, and we maintain that there is sufficient revenue raised in the various British settlements (since, according to present official phraseology, they are none of them colonies now) to enable the several administrations on the West Coast to take some very efficient steps for promoting that education among the people without which we can never expect such a number of them to emerge from barbarism as will suffice to form those self-governing nations which the British Parliament desires, and which we desire, to see established there; that there is sufficient revenue for this, and at the same time for those sanitary improvements almost equally indispensable, and to which we are glad to see something like proper attention is being now paid at Lagos. In our last we briefly noticed, in a letter from Cape Coast, the state of the Government school there, placed under uneducated discharged soldiers as schoolmasters. In another article in this day's paper, we bring again prominently forward as it merits the relative expenditure in Sierra Leone, for Government schools, and for police, &c., the former under 3000l. a-year, the latter 14,000l., the Inspector-General of Police (a recently-established office, and almost a sinecure), having a salary of nearly double the amount per annum of the sum spent on education; and if we turn to Bathurst or Lagos, we find no bright spot there. If this creditable to the British Government? Does it not rather show a most scandalous neglect of duty on their part? Can any one maintain the existence of any real desire in Downing-street to raise the people of these settlements rapidly to a state of fitness for self-government, or, indeed, to elevate them at all in the social scale? We demand education for the people of the West Coast. They have furnished abundant evidence of their capacity to profit by it. If the Church of England Missionary Society can fit a boy taken out of the hold of a slaver to become a bishop—and no one has ever questioned the fitness of Dr. Samuel Crowther, the Bishop of Niger, for this sacred office—if out of similar materials it has been enabled to train so many men for the duties of ministers of the Church, as to have justified it in withdrawing Europeans from Sierra Leone, and giving over the churches to native pastorate—if the Wesleyans can raise efficient native catechists and pastors for the Cape Coast District, we are not to be met by the assertion that there is no encouragement to attempt a general education of the natives. There is every encouragement; their greatest detractors admit that the Africans learn readily and rapidly up to a certain stage; and we have many salient proofs how very far they\n83""}, {'id': 3242, 'article_title': 'Lagos Slave Buyers', 'full_section_title': 'Lagos Slave Buyers', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1876#article-18', 'issue_date': '01_11_1876', 'content': 'Moral Upas-tree of slavery overshadows all Africa. Turn where one will, one finds it poisoning the moral atmosphere, making all that is good to be impossible, spreading violence, murder, disease, misery, destruction, and death everywhere. We thought we had got rid of it within the British settlement of Lagos; but, alas! it seems to be beyond doubt that the abomination is still there. The letter of ""Otitor Koro"" in our last number—a letter not anonymous, but offering every guarantee of being dependable and true in what it asserts—calls us anew to the combat. We did not wait until now to respond to the call. When we first read that letter our spirit was mightily stirred within us, and we wrote immediately such a leader for our October number as the grossness of the evil seemed imperatively to demand from us. That leader, with most of the new and important matter intended for our October number, miscarried in the post—a mishap that was not known until there was then no longer time for remedy. But there is time now for us to expose and attack this abomination. The accursed thing is there, like to the forbidden spoil secreted in the tents of Achan; and there is no possibility of good for or in Lagos until it be brought forth and destroyed. Out with it, out of the tent, or hut, or house, and bring it to public light. Can it be any longer a matter of wonder that we should have had to lament that Lagos has done hitherto so much less than we had fondly hoped and believed it would do in the spread of civilization and Christianity around it, seeing that it is in itself so deeply polluted? If the source be bitter, the waters flowing from it cannot be sweet. The source must be purified. We thought this had been done, so far at least as regards slavery and slave-dealing, when Lagos was declared a British settlement, and a general registration was made of all within its borders who had up to that time been held and possessed as slaves. Shame, shame on those who now stir up within us former memories and recall to our mind the past of Lagos, when the accursed foreign slave-ships were there loading with cargoes of human misery for the plantations of Cuba and Brazil! Shame, shame, ten thousand times shame, that it is not now the greedy foreign pirates who are stimulating the equally horrid greed of the debased heathen Africans of the interior to obtain by war and kidnapping, with their attendant murders, burnings, and desolations, the hundreds and thousands of their wretched fellow-countrymen and countrywomen that were wanted to cram the fetid hold of the slave-ship! It is now people calling themselves civilized Africans, educated Africans, men and women who have been taught in missionary schools, men and women who are possibly attending divine service in churches and chapels, that are violating the most precious precepts of Him on whom they profess to believe for salvation. These, these, alas! are the people who are now stimulating the greed of the interior heathen and inciting them to the perpetration of the old enormities by becoming purchasers of the human merchandise they bring for sale to the markets of Ejirin and Ikorodu. In one respect we are not sorry that our intended leader of last month did not make its appearance in our columns. The letter on the ""Woes of Ijesha,"" &c., which has since reached us, and which we now publish, shows us whence those poor human victims of brutality and lust are derived. Writing of the oppressed and devastated districts of Ijesha the writer, under the signature of ""Okanlogue,"" states that the barbarous oppressors ""look upon the remnant of the people in the country as their fortune, for there is not an Ejirin or Ikorodu market in which the sons and daughters of the soil are not to be found as one of the articles for speculation; besides which, many of them are daily purchased by the cruel King of Dahomey, to be offered in sacrifice at his Customs."" It may be that on reading this extract some of the despicable offenders who are renewing the slave-trade at Lagos, violating the public law as well as the precepts of the religion they profess, will say, Is it not better that we should purchase these people than that they should be sold to Dahomey? No; it is not better. Their motive in buying these victims has not been to save them from the tender mercies of Dahomey, but one of lust or greed. There is not even a shadow of good in the thing; it is hideous and abominable in its every aspect—filthy and loathsome throughout. Away with it; it must and will poison everything around it. There are good men and women in Lagos,—what have they been about to allow this abomination to exist among them? There are British authorities in Lagos, and British laws are in force there,—what have those authorities been about not to enforce those laws? Lagos is not so large a place that those slave-trade practices could be carried on in a corner unknown of by the innocent portion of the community. The sole object in view by the British Government when it annexed Lagos was to extirpate the slave-trade and slavery therein and within the sphere of its influence. The foreign slave-trade is now, thanks be to God, quite a thing of the past in West Africa. There are not any slave-ships now carrying cargoes of human victims to over-sea countries. It cannot be permitted that a new traffic in slaves should be established in Lagos (for those who buy will sell also when lust is satisfied, or money may be made by it) soiling and dishonouring anew the British flag, in defiance of British law and the feelings of the British Government and people, who have done all they could to wipe out the iniquity of their forefathers, who permitted and took part in the loathsome foreign slave-trade. We call upon the British authorities in Lagos to set to work at once and put an end, root and branch, to the slave-trade and slave-holding iniquity that ""Otitor Koro"" has brought under our notice, and which cannot now be any further ignored or winked at. There surely cannot be an ineradicable sympathy with these practices in Lagos; but we must say it seems strange that it should have been found necessary to invoke our aid against them. Be this as it may, our duty was clear. Not only do we denounce it in our columns—not only do we cry shame upon the perpetrators of the evil, and demand immediate action against it on the part of the responsible British authorities in Lagos, but we have brought the hated matter directly under the notice of the Earl of Carnarvon, who will, we are well assured, not lose any time in expressing his disapprobation as regards the official remissness which has rendered it possible for him to be thus appealed to; and his expectation that although the new stain cannot be removed, the pollution will, at least, be effectually destroyed.'}, {'id': 4002, 'article_title': 'THE CHRISTIAN POLICY OF EMPIRE', 'full_section_title': 'THE CHRISTIAN POLICY OF EMPIRE', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-13', 'issue_date': '01_07_1880', 'content': '\n\nsceptre in succession, and to pass it on in ever-widening range of rule until, settled at last on the Atlantic seaboards of Europe, it stretched across the ocean, and added a new hemisphere to its realm. Of this energy one main, one may almost say, as far as the outer form and structure is concerned, the main, organ has been the principle of empire—the constraining, compacting force of the great leaders, and, on a larger scale, the great races of the world. And yet the very saddest chapter of history is the history of empire. Everywhere, and in all ages its page is stained by tears and deep dyed in blood. Caesar is said to have left a million men dead in his trails of conquest, and that represents a great nation\'s wailing; a nation weeping for its children and refusing to be comforted because they are not; while to follow the steps of an Attila, Genghis Khan, a Tamerlane, and mark the unutterable horror that attended their paths of conquest, would make the very blood curdle and the marrow freeze in the bones. And yet, awful as have been the desolations through which the imperial leaders and the imperial races of man have advanced to their triumph, the progress has been as conspicuous, nay, more conspicuous, than the desolation, and the blessing has overspread the bane, so that, looked at from a great height, and on a large scale, it is the advance in power, in culture, in all that makes life worth the living, which attracts and fills the sight. It would be hard to over-estimate the misery which must righteously be laid at the door of empire, but there is one sum which would cast its figures utterly into the shade, and that is the cost of barbarism, anarchy, and savagery to the world. The history of the barbarian realm of our nature, of savage tribes and nations, is unwritten yet. There is no prophet to write, no poet to sing it, but could we read it, the horror of horrors of history would be there. God maintains the principle of empire. He sends forth men manifestly born to rule, and men as manifestly born to be ruled, in every age; but as, with man the transgressor, He chastises the abuse of a noble faculty by the most terrible judgments, so He chastises nations. As of old, He lets men work their will and have their way. But they have hardly taken a step when the avenger is upon them. We are paying now, and shall have to pay, a heavy retribution for one of the most unrighteous and unholy acts of aggression which stain the pages of recent history. Is this association of empire with brutal force and cunning fraud never to be broken—is the grand principle never to be redeemed? And what is its redemption? The principle is very simple, close to hand, like all the most needful truths: ""Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law and the prophets."" No doubt, under present conditions, the full and thorough working out of these Christian ideas is hopeless. We need Christians to make Christian principles powers. But we may recognize the obligation and begin the application of some of its broader principles to our imperial transactions with the people subject to our sway. I fear that we have got into a miserable and demoralising habit of keeping two balances, one for ourselves and our equals, and one for our subjects and dependents. We invade a country under some imagined imperial necessity; we fight battles, we leave the ground thick strewn with dead. No matter how thickly the corpses of our enemies may be strewn on the ground, we take no shame to ourselves and express no sorrow. But if an enemy, using such skill and courage as he possesses, assail an ill-defended post of our army, and covers the ground with the British dead, that is a massacre, and the whole country is stirred to frenzy. Again, we invade a territory at the other part of our empire. We force a resident envoy on a free and unwilling people. He is basely murdered. We move our armies on the capital to avenge the insult by the condign punishment of the perpetrators of the crime. The people rise in arms against us, and bar our progress; we scatter them like chaff, and occupy their city; we seek out, try by summary process, and hang the culprits, and then we proceed to treat those who fought against us as guilty of a crime worthy of death; and so the wholesale hanging goes on. Our invasion, utterly unprovoked, totally needless in the judgment of our very ablest Indian statesmen, is legitimate warfare. The inhabitants who meet us in arms in defence of their homes and their State are rebels and traitors whom we may shoot or hang at will; for which shooting and hanging a stern retribution, we may be sure, will be exacted at our hands. The Christian policy of empire demands from us imperatively an equal judgment—that we measure our foes by precisely the same standards which we claim the right to apply to ourselves. If they fight for home and hearth, they are doing what we have done again and again, and for which we claim the praise of man. I have seen statements lately in military correspondence, and in leading articles of leading journals, which proclaim the brutal policy of empire, which, unless we promptly and truly reform it, will make our empire hateful and loathsome to the subject races, and will challenge its destruction, after the fashion of Babylon of old, root and branch from the earth. But do not misunderstand the matter. Christian policy is the rose-water method of dealing with the interests of men or communities. It may have a very stern grasp in its hand of love, but it insists on the Christian law, ""Look not every man on his own things, but also on the things of others."" Claim no empire, wield no authority which is not as considerate of the rights of others as of your own. Make empire, if the sceptre is in the nation\'s hand, a strong means of uplifting, comforting, and saving all who dwell under its shield. Let it spread, because men see the benediction which it proffers, the glad tidings of peace, industry, progress, and happiness which it brings.'}]","[{'document_title': 'MR.

He knew that the impression they had acquired from various sources was that the beneficent results were enormous; but he had been enabled to see for himself the nature of those results and to draw his own conclusions, and he appeared before them to put a pin into the beautiful iridescent bubble which they had blown for themselves with the materials supplied by the ignorant, the interested, the colour-blind, and the hopelessly biassed. Taking a bird's-eye view of the whole situation in time and space, so that each factor might assume its proper relative position and proportion, he unhesitatingly affirmed in the plainest language that so far their intercourse with African races, instead of being a blessing, had been little better than an unmitigated curse to them. These were strong statements, they would say, and required confirmation. If true, what could possibly have caused this frightful miscarriage of the noblest aspirations of a Christian people? The answer was simply the nature of their commerce with Africa in the past and present.

With equal audacity, a French Cardinal has been preaching a crusade of wrath and vengeance in the name of the Prince of Peace, and calling upon Christendom to unite in sending the fiery cross of blood and slaughter amongst the Arabs in Equatorial Africa. The Pope, too, has lent his countenance and support to this bellicose expedition, although he would, no doubt, tell us that the weapons of his warfare are not carnal but spiritual. Then Britain must needs join in the attack by blockading the coast for the benefit of Germany. It may be asked, What all these armed and warlike proceedings are about? Ostensibly for the suppression of the slave trade, but in reality, for the exploitation of Africa in the interests of European capitalists, speculators, and land grabbers. Religious jealousy inspires many of those modern crusaders, for whose encouragement the holy Father will, no doubt, promise the same reward as his predecessors did to the zealots who attempted to wrest Palestine from the Saracens. An eminent traveller has lately borne testimony to the self-sacrificing life and labours of the Arab missionaries in the Dark Continent. Like the early apostles, they go forth without money, scrip, or change of raiment; entering the villages with the salutation of peace, fraternizing with the natives, and dwelling amongst them as friends and instructors. Under their trading whole tribes have abandoned their hereditary fetish worship, their human sacrifices, their cannibal feasts, their abominable obscene rites, and become converts to the faith of Abraham and Mohammed. Whilst Islam thus exerts such an elevating and beneficial influence, it cannot be denied that the African becomes almost always worse for his intercourse with European traders. For every native who falls a victim to the slave trade, how many are consumed by the more accursed liquor traffic, by the vile, poisonous, maddening concoctions introduced by Germans and Englishmen, who talk in such a sanctimonious manner of the ""sacred principles of humanity and Christianity?"" The Arab slave dealer may kill the body, but is not able to kill the soul; whilst this European spirit-seller sends both body and soul to perdition.

In many cases he rises to the highest offices of State, his race and colour being no impediment to his advancement. In what part of Christendom would the same toleration be displayed? The descendants of those who robbed the poor of their patrimony in Reformation times would be horrified at the idea of a negro filling the position of Cabinet Minister, however grand his abilities might be. The professed abhorrence of English society for the institution of slavery can be estimated at its right value by those who remember the sympathy exhibited by the British nobility and gentry for the slave owning oligarchy of the Southern States during the Rebellion.

It is now nearly twelve months since Lagos was pointed out to us, as at one and the same time carrying on an extensive slave-trade, and recruiting the ranks of domestic slavery within the colony; unchecked, though we never can admit that it could have been unobserved, by the British authorities there; and until then not denounced, or publicly rebuked, either by Christian missionaries or the admitted and acknowledged members of their respective churches. The European missionaries, and the native pastors and teachers, all, we are bound to presume, deeply imbued with the principles and precepts inculcated by Him who preached the Sermon on the Mount, are not few in number; while the communicants in the churches may be counted by hundreds. How is it to be accounted for, that of this not inconsiderable body of British officials and missionaries, and native pastors, teachers, and communicants, not one, until our correspondent addressed us on the subject,—not one, we say, entered the lists against what they know to be as abominable in the eyes of British law, as it is repugnant to the spirit of that Christianity which they all profess? We can only account for it by what seems to be the fact, that as we have stated, the whole atmosphere of Africa is so tainted by the spirit of the slave-trade and of slavery, that to inhale it produces a moral and spiritual torpor, from which only an exceptionally vigorous and sensitive conscience can free itself. Under such circumstances, an independent and uncompromising public Press is manifestly a vital necessity for Africa, if the hope is to be indulged of her ever being reclaimed from that abyss of misery and degradation, of moral filth and spiritual loathsomeness into which she has been plunged, by the long-continued dominion within her of the most debasing superstitions and vices that ever fettered humanity. Regard it as they may in the vitiated atmosphere they breathe on the African Coast, and familiarized as they are with the abominable evil, so as to be perhaps unconscious of its ruinous tendencies, our African readers may rest assured that the material progress which is so important for them as regards their trading operations, depends in a very great degree on the extent to which freedom shall replace slavery. These readers of ours, we are told, comprise every African on the West Coast who has any pretension whatever to be classed as an educated man. We call upon them all to lay this truth seriously to heart. If they desire the development of the resources of the countries that supply the produce in which they trade, they should use all their influence, individually and collectively, against those gigantic paralyzers of human energies for purposes of good, the slave-trade and slavery. Their eye should not pity, their heart should not spare, any one among themselves whose covetousness, or other vile and debasing lusts, may lead him to dishonour the education that has been bestowed upon him, by buying or selling his fellow-creatures. The letters from Lagos and Cape Coast, to which we gave insertion in our August number, show, unhappily, how very necessary it is that we place these truths clearly and constantly before them, so long as God may grant us the energy and means to do so. The Hydra of African slavery must be killed. We have pledged ourselves to a war of extermination against it. Every educated man and woman on the West Coast ought to be active and energetic soldiers in our army. Thanks especially to the exertions of our noble missionary societies, there is now no inconsiderable number of educated women on the Coast; women, Christians too we hope in reality, as well as in profession, in addition to being educated. This great question of the total disappearance of slavery from among them; of that horribly debasing, degrading institution, under which members of their own sex may be purchased—victims in body and soul—ministers to lust and to every brutal passion, for a few pounds sterling, or dollars, or pieces of cloth, or bags of cowries—this question, we repeat, touches them nearly. The position that they and their educated female children may occupy; the greater or less consideration with which they will be regarded and treated, depends in no small degree, on the continuance or annihilation of female domestic slavery. They must—it is inevitable—they must be included, more or less, in the degradation that falls upon their human sisters. We call upon them to regard it as an accursed thing; as striking at the very root of that elevation of themselves in the community, to which their sex has attained in the Christian countries of Europe. We call upon them to look at it as the forbidden spoil in the tent of Achan, bringing a curse upon the whole community to which the culprit belongs. It is quite time that the educated women in Africa, particularly in the British settlements, where they are under the protection of British laws, should make their purifying influence felt in this vital matter. It is for them to cast a halo of purity and of Christian love around; to show in practice as in word, that they love their poorer sisters as themselves. It is only thus that there can be any hope of the purification of African society; any hope of that material as well as Christian advancement, which can alone raise Africa from the degraded position it holds in European opinion; a position owing in no small degree to that abominable slave-trade and slavery, which we call upon them to use their utmost efforts to eradicate.', 'last_edit_date': '1877-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1877#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""A Liberian's View of the African Problem"", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following extracts from a recent letter of the Rev.

I said to some of them: \'You are spending millions of money on a line in which it must be wasted. Europeans cannot do the work which you desire to do in Africa—if your desire is to open up the country and regenerate the people—by the methods at present pursued. You have had for nigh 300 years the unrequited labour of the African in the Western hemisphere, and it may be that all the money you have made through his labour will have to be spent in connexion with his country before anything will be done of permanent utility; but it is a pity that the money, of which you seem to have an unlimited supply, should not be spent in a manner to yield better results.\'""\n\nThe writer continues:—\n\n""To talk of Europeans colonising intertropical Africa is the greatest piece of folly that men with the experience of past generations and the present before them could be guilty. The enterprises in East Africa, both of Englishmen and Germans, are only commercial movements, not colonisation, and are not only liable to but will share the fate which has befallen all great European, secular or religious, movements in equatorial Africa. You rightly consider that the agents in the work of Africa\'s regeneration are the civilised and Christianised negroes now in exile. Mahometanism, notwithstanding the sneers of some and the ignorance of others, is doing a wonderful work in Africa, really preserving the people against the unscrupulous proceedings of European traders and adventurers. The Arabs can do no harm, they as readily follow as lead in negro land. Jesus Christ as a religious reformer and as a regenerator of all the races of mankind was right. These organisations, which undertake to represent Him among foreign races, have not yet half understood Him, and He will not endorse work which not only contravenes the spirit but the letter of his teachings. After Europe shall have been purged of the wrongs which it has inflicted upon Africa, and has got rid of the gold unjustly acquired through the blood of the children of the Dark Continent, then it may be given to these would-be-masters of humanity to see the proper course both for their own and Africa\'s weal.""', 'last_edit_date': '1889-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_08_1889#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH MISRULE IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Under this heading there has lately appeared in the London Daily Graphic a series of illustrated articles, tending to show how demoralizing to the Native mind is much that arises from the present system of British rule and influence in this part of the world. It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

It was impossible that we could allow the article headed ""Slave-trade,"" which we have copied verbatim from the missionary paper, the Iwe Irohin, of Abeokuta, to pass unnoticed. When we see the hitherto consistent friends of the high social morality of the Gospel, and preachers of the universal brotherhood of mankind, for all of whom, if they will accept the salvation He has purchased for them, Christ, our Saviour, died, fall into such grievous error, we mourn bitterly over the declension which we feel we are right in attributing to the heathen influences by which they are surrounded.\n\nIt is not our desire to gain any distinction by argument or invective over our fellow-labourers who have so unhappily yielded for a moment to the power of circumstances. In calling attention to their error, we shall only state that it has deeply grieved many of their oldest friends in this country, who consider they have made their error yet more serious in appending their excuse of slavery to the intelligence of the capture of a slave-ship near Whydah. They know but too well that the heathen of Abeokuta are manstealers. In justifying the practice of slavery to which the heathen cling, and which is working such frightful evils—which is, indeed, at the root of the social degradation of the country—they are, for a fancied momentary benefit, neutralising to a very great extent their powers for good. Any departure from the lofty standard of Christian principle must do this. And by implication, in thus defending slavery, without one word in condemnation of the manstealing practised around them, or of the horrible trade in which the slave-ship whose capture they record was engaged, they may be supposed, although we are sure they had no such intention, to justify both the one and the other.\n\nIf we had previously, which we had not, entertained the least doubt of the correctness of our view, that for the spread of civilisation and Christianity in Africa there must be the influence of a Christian power behind and around the propagators of the truth, that doubt would now have been removed. Such a defence or excuse of slavery would never have been published by a Christian missionary in Sierra Leone, or in Lagos. ""The tendency of Christianity"" is not to ""diminish"" only, but to extirpate slavery, which is diametrically opposed to the great command which our Saviour placed next after the love of God himself. We implore our Abeokuta friends to take the earliest opportunity for defending, in this interesting paper, the real high Christian social morality of the Gospel, and for showing that no man can be really and truly a Christian who is either a manstealer, a slavetrader, or a possessor of slaves.', 'last_edit_date': '1862-11-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_11_1862#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE INTERIOR SLAVE TRADE IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Intelligence has recently reached England that the slave trade, with all its dreadful accessories of burning villages and bloodshed, is carried on close to the very border of the Sierra Leone territory, and sometimes over roads made by British money, although outside the boundary.

But it seems too bad that in order to obtain slaves for the interior the property of British subjects should be destroyed, the Sunday quiet of a mission station disturbed, the congregation scattered, and school children captured, all of which took place recently at Mabang, near the Ribbe river, and that there should be no redress for the wrong-doing. The fact is that in most parts of the extra-colonial territory a painful anarchy prevails, which Christianity alone can rectify. Every tribal dispute is made to feed the domestic slave trade. Should there be a lack of slaves for the market, or should it suit the caprice of the slave dealer, a raid is made on a village much in the same way in which the foreign slave trade was in bygone years supplied.\n\nWhat are the remedies? The great remedy is, of course, the Gospel; but there might be more stringent treaties made with the chiefs and head men, who should be urged to associate themselves for the purpose of putting down the trade.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'REVIEW.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As we have often exposed European misconduct in these countries, we may be allowed to quote F.R.G.S. on the same subject: ""There are about 100 Europeans in the land; amongst these there are many excellent fellows, but—it is an unpleasant confession to make—the others appear to me inferior to the Africans, native as well as mulatto.

In the course of a sketch of his expedition he expressed an opinion that the outlay of vigour and money on the conversion of the natives is worse than thrown away. The negroes who persevere in Christianity, he declares, become disdainful of manual labour. They prefer to occupy themselves with noisy prayer meetings during their intervals of exertion. Most of their time is spent in loitering and in begging of white men. Their general destination, he alleges, is vagabondism, after which they abandon Christianity altogether, and turn professional criminals. Now Mr. Farler shows that Dr. Lenz has brought a universal indictment against missions in Africa, though the limits of his experience prove he is entitled to speak only of a portion. But Mr. Farler has no inclination to leave the Tanganyika and Nyassa settlements, which Dr. Lenz had opportunities of inspecting, under obloquy. He appeals to the effects produced in every locality in which missions have been established, in evidence that the results have not been small, and still less pernicious. To the magnitude of the difficulties the distinction achieved by travellers such as Dr. Lenz testifies. As Mr. Farler says, the explorer traverses the continent with all possible speed. His intercourse with the natives is confined to the employment of them for his own service. Their habits and moral condition are no concern of his. After a year or two he comes back to Europe, to be glorified by all classes of society. Mr. Farler does not deny the courageous traveller has borne hardships; but he asks, if that be praiseworthy, what is the due of Englishmen who expatriate themselves for life in the Dark Continent, not to learn its ways, but to purify them? If there be some meagreness in the results attained, he points out that the obstacles to be overcome are enormous.

He was also a mediator in conflicts between individuals and families. However, there was no shortage of subjects of tension. 59 In the Mossi kingdom of Wagadugu, slaves were made into eunuchs in sufficiently large numbers for it to be feasible to export them northward. In Asante, the quantity of human livestock obtained by the payment of tribute was so great that when the slave trade was abolished, the Asantehene stated that he could not feed the 20 000 captives whom he had on his hands, adding, 'unless I kill or sell them, they will grow strong and kill my people'. 60 It appears, however, that social relations between slaves and their owners were marked by less hostility in societies not having a central power structure. We are told that in the village of Pura, slaves were fed 'just like everyone else'. M. PŁre tells us that in the Lobi country, each submatriclan was divided into two groups: the true-born Weya, and the Dea, who were of captive origin. The latter category included people who had been adopted because they had been found at the door one morning, seeking refuge from famine or raiding. Both categories, however, were fully integrated within the social structure as sources of production and progeny. Accordingly, a slave lived in the same hut as his master, whom he addressed as 'father'; he was a member of the same kin group as the latter and was subject to the same rituals and taboos and engaged in the same work; his owner gave him a wife, he possessed a field, and was entitled to accumulate cowries to the point of buying his freedom or purchasing another man to replace him. What was required of him was that he remain in the same village as his master.$^{61}$ Here we see a clear indication of a deliberate policy of using slavery as a means of strengthening clan or territorial groups."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic tensions > Production and trade', 'content': ""The abolition of the slave trade by Britain in 1807 introduced an element of structural imbalance into this situation, especially in the south, where surveillance was instituted earliest and maintained most strictly, although domestic slavery was tolerated.$^{48}$ During the second half of the nineteenth century slavery expanded very substantially, especially in the Niger bend.

The main sources of supply, however, were not only the great djihäd conducted by the Muslim leaders of the north and the conflicts in Mossi territory. The trade was also fed from a host of channels that sluiced off slaves from peoples belonging to hundreds of chieftaincies, from the territories of the Tuareg to the areas bordering the trading posts on the coast. During the final decades of the nineteenth century, war broke out in virtually every decade and in virtually every region, and war meant captives.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

While sedentary societies that did not have a centralized power structure were the most affected by the convulsions of the time, they took refuge in fidelity to their traditional code of life as an antidote to their trials.\nThe situation of slaves and caste members was much worse in centralized states. The most radical upheaval was undoubtedly the one that occurred in the Fulbe groups: originally nomads under the domination of the Gulmanceba, within a few years after the djiKäd they in turn had become overlords ruling indigenous peoples, or peoples whom they had reduced to the level of commoners, captives and serfs (bellah or remaibe), condemned to the tasks of cultivation and herding.

Similarly, the chiefs of Jiibo received gifts at 'salutations' and levied a tax on salt for which traders were liable. Aristocrats were sometimes attended by hundreds of dependants.

In the sugar and plantation-based economic zones of Brazil, the Caribbean, and the lowlands of Mexico, Colombia and Peru, the rights of slaves as well as free persons of colour tended to be circumscribed in direct proportion to the overall demands of their labour. In the coffee, cattle and fishing areas of south-eastern Brazil, Puerto Rico, eastern Cuba, and the interior provinces of Venezuela and Argentina, social mobility tended to be greater, social distances shorter, and internal class and caste distinctions more relaxed and less formal than in the plantation zones. Meanwhile, in the towns and cities like Buenos Aires, Lima, Sào Paulo, Caracas, Havana, Vera Cruz, Puebla and Mexico City, Africans enjoyed considerable freedom from restraint, and often competed for some of the occupations performed by other free members of the society/These social arrangements affected but did not determine the relationship between AfroAmericans and the rest of the population in the later nineteenth century and the twentieth century.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.604, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The abolitionist period', 'content': 'But since the plantation complex varied throughout the Americas the socializing forces within which the Africans and their descendants would mould their own American culture likewise varied.

The Abeokutans only bring the men to sell, but not any of the women soldiers. This corroborates the report we have heard, that the Abeokutans preferred taking women prisoners to the men, not because they were afraid of the men, but that the women may be kept for wives.\n\nI think the poor women like rather to stop at Abeokuta than stopping at Dahomey. A very short time before going to attack Abeokuta, seven poor young women were killed for having transgressed with men, but the men were spared. On that occasion there were several hundred pardoned for the same cause, but the case of the seven was the worst one; that was the reason they were not spared. Three weeks ago our trade was stopped by orders having come from the King to seize every pot of palm-oil seen carried by any of his subjects for less than half-price, to aid him in buying back his people from the Abeokutans. This order, of course, obliged the oil-sellers to hide their oil instead of bringing it to market. We have been obliged to send messenger after messenger, which has induced him to give up, and now we are getting in better trade.\n\nThe French Commissioner, who went to Dahomey three weeks ago with the Consul, Mr. Dumas, has sent down a circular to report that he has been kept and treated as a prisoner. This report could not be correct, as there is no reason for it. It must have been caused by his being ignorant of the habits of the King and people, and because he has not got the chance * to take his leave of the King to come down, he makes it out that he is detained a prisoner.

To find that person out they made shea butter hot and put it into a wooden bowl. A silver ring, which they put into the hot oil, had to be taken out first, by a representative of every family.

There was an order made before they tried this ordeal that nobody was permitted to rub himself with lemon juice. Now, there was a man who said, that in the night before the ordeal somebody had rubbed him with lemon juice; he did not know who it was, and could not help it.

Moreover, the slave-hunters\' armies are composed of slaves who are often more ferocious than their captors. When a party of slave-hunters wish to make a raid, they visit some friendly chief, and by presents and promises cajole him to assist them in their terrible work. They then join forces and prepare to attack some neighbouring tribe, whose cattle are to be given to the black and friendly allies, whilst the Arabs carry off the human spoil. Then in the early morning, before the sun has risen, the combined forces steal upon their sleeping and unsuspecting victims. Some of the huts and houses are first fired, and then in the confusion which ensues, the men capable of bearing arms are shot down, and the old of both sexes are butchered with every refinement of cruelty, and all the young men, young women, and children are chained and yoked together to be driven off and sold as slaves. In the long and painful march fresh horrors are of hourly and daily occurrence. Those who fall out of the line, and can no longer drag the heavy and ponderous sheebah, or wooden yoke, are murdered in cold blood or left to perish of hunger. Women, who are nursing, have their babies dashed against a stone before their eyes, as it is known they could not carry their burden for many days.

This is the effect of the old Mahomedan influence, and the sword of the knights follows the infidel enemies of the Koran.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-10-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1872#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Re Slave-holding on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—In commenting in your June number last, headed ""The Late Events in Abeokuta, and Responsibility of Slave-holders,"" I noted the following, which I beg leave to quote: ""We have heard of sad atrocities committed by some of them on their slaves in Fernando Po; and Fernando Po is not likely to be an exception."" Dear Mr. Editor, you have been proved in many ways to be a constant friend of the African race, and, knowing your extensive views and philanthropic interest in African affairs, especially the West Coast, I doubt not that you will insert this, which will remove the error produced in the minds of the public by the above statement, that the Sierra Leone men in Fernando Po are slave-holders.\n\nI beg leave also to state that I have been for several years in Fernando Po, and do not know of any Sierra Leone man holding or dealing in slaves; that the aborigines of Fernando Po—the Boobees—though thirty have not yet been civilized out of nearly thirty thousand—are not known to be bartering their children and relatives, as almost all the heathen nations on the West Coast are in the habit of doing; that to err is human. The statement alleged against the Sierra Leone men in Fernando Po is an error, and ought to be declared as such, and be erased from the minds of the public.\n\nI am not insensible of an article inserted in this paper, between 1875 and 1876, referring to a sad atrocity committed on a servant or ""slave girl"" at Fernando Po; but the culprit was neither a Sierra Leone masculine nor feminine.\n\nIt is known generally that Sierra Leone men and others who travel on this coast, especially to the interior, are in the habit of redeeming slaves at different times and under various conditions, some of them when they are about to be killed, others under torture and ill-treatment; many of whom so redeemed have been taken to Lagos and Sierra Leone, and treated as the law provides, enjoying the advantages of civilization, and can testify to-day to this fact. But to know that some are really dealing in slaves, as it is reported, if it be true, is distressing in heart; and I agree with you that they should ""be lawfully tried, and, if found guilty, punished by the Gold Coast courts of justice"" as an example.\n\nH.

The depositions of the witnesses, which are now for the first time published in this country, show that indescribable cruelties were committed by these ruffians and their accomplices, among whom, it will be remembered, was the wife of Williams. Two slave girls were subjected to frightful brutalities, although fortunately only one died. They were tied back to back and severely flogged by the man John, and by Mrs. Williams. Then a troop of school children were actually sent for to continue the flogging, and many of the boys, it appears, supplied themselves with sticks from a guava tree, and shamefully beat the poor girls in the presence of the ex-missionaries and their wives. Subsequently they were cruelly tortured with cayenne pepper; one of them—Amé by name—dying in the course of the night, a bottle of rum being given to the man who buried her to bribe him not to tell what had happened. The culprits richly merited the severe sentences which were ultimately passed upon them; but many readers of the Correspondence will be disposed to think that it was a case which called for the infliction of the extreme penalty of the law, at all events against two of the offenders. The prosecution was beset with difficulties, owing to the fact that the outrages were committed in districts beyond British jurisdiction. Ultimately a Commission was appointed under the Great Seal for the trial of the prisoners, but the Commissioners nevertheless describe this machinery as ""cumbrous,"" and as ""extremely difficult in the working."" We are glad to learn that under the provisions of a new Order in Council the administration of justice in similar cases seems likely to be simplified. A slave-dealer named Astrop gave an extraordinary piece of information to the authorities of the Gold Coast. He declared that every Sierra Leone man who went to the Niger purchased slaves, and that even the missionaries followed this bad example, adding that on many occasions he had ""reproved some of them for ill-treating their slaves."" It is manifest that a charge of this startling nature, given to the world in an official document, cannot be allowed to remain unanswered.—*Daily News.*', 'last_edit_date': '1883-04-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_04_1883#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LETTERS OF DR. LIVINGSTONE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Now, these people, so like ourselves externally, have genuine human souls. Rua, a very large section of country north and west of Cazembe\'s, but still in the same inland region, is peopled by men very like those of Insama and Cazembe. An Arab, Syde Bin Habib, went to trade in Rua two years ago, and as the Arabs usually do where the natives have no guns, Syde Bin Habib\'s elder brother carried matters with a high hand. The Rua men observed that the elder brother slept in a white tent, and, pitching their spears into it by night, killed him. As Moslems never forgive bloodshed, the younger brother forthwith ran amuck on all indiscriminately in a large district. Let it not be supposed that any of these people are like the American Indians—insatiable, bloodthirsty savages, who will not be reclaimed or enter into terms of lasting friendship with fair-dealing strangers. Had the actual murderers been demanded, and a little time been granted, I feel morally certain, from many other instances among tribes who, like the Ba Rua, have not been spoiled by Arab traders, they would all have been given up. The chiefs of the country would, first of all, have specified the crime of which the elder brother was guilty, and who had been led to avenge it. It is very likely that they would stipulate that no other should be punished but the actual perpetrator. Domestic slaves acting under his orders would be considered free from blame. I know of nothing that distinguishes the uncontaminated Africans from other degraded peoples more than their entire reasonableness and good sense. It is different after they have had wives, children, and relatives kidnapped; but that is more than human nature, civilised or savage, can bear. In the case in question indiscriminate slaughter, capture, and plunder took place. A very large number of very fine young men were captured and secured in chains and wooden yokes. I came near the party of Syde Bin Habib, close to the point where a rent in the mountains of Rua allows the escape of the great river Lualaba out of Lake Moero. And here I had for the first time an opportunity of observing the difference between slaves and freemen made captives. When fairly across Lualaba Syde thought his captives safe, and got rid of the trouble of attending to and watching the chained gangs by taking off both chains and yokes. All declared their joy, and perfect willingness to follow Syde to the end of the world or elsewhere, but next morning twenty-two made clear off to the mountains. Many more, on seeing the broad Lualaba roll between them and the homes of their infancy, lost all heart, and in three days eight of them died. The had no complaint but pain in the heart, and they pointed out its seat correctly; though many believe that the heart is situated underneath the top of the sternum or breast-bone. This to me was the most startling death I ever saw. They evidently died of broken-heartedness, and the Arabs wondered, \'seeing they had plenty to eat.\' I saw the others perish, particularly a very fine boy of ten or twelve years of age. When asked if he felt ill he put his hand correctly and exactly over the heart. He was kindly carried, and as he breathed out his soul was laid gently on the side of the path. The captors were not unusually cruel. They were callous—slaving had hardened their hearts. When Syde, who was an old friend of mine, crossed the Lualaba, he heard that I was in a village where a company of slave traders had been furiously assaulted for three days by justly-incensed Babeemba. I would not fight nor allow my people to fire if I saw them, because the Babeemba had been especially kind to me. Syde sent a party of his own people to invite me to leave the village by night, and come to him. He showed himself the opposite of hard-hearted; but slaving \'hardens all within, and petrifies the feelings.\' It is hard for the victims, and for the victimisers.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1872#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ANOTHER BRUTAL FRENCHMAN; AND DISCREDITABLE STATE OF COLONIAL FEELING.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The condition of the coolies employed as labourers in the Mauritius approaches, it is well known, very closely to that of slaves. A case just tried at the Port Louis Assizes affords additional proof of this fact, while the circumstances connected with it show that public opinion in the colony is not, at present, favourable to any improvement in this state of things. From the evidence given at the trial it appears that a Frenchman named Tampier, an overseer on the estate of M. de Chazal, one of the most humane planters in the Mauritius, was visiting a field in which a number of labourers were employed, when being displeased with the manner in which one of the coolies performed his task, he struck the man, knocked him down, and, leaping upon his prostrate body, stamped and kicked until his passion expended its strength. The victim died of this treatment within half-an-hour. Notwithstanding this fact, the jury at Tampier\'s first trial could not agree as to their verdict. At the second trial for unpremeditated murder, the jury found the overseer guilty of a common assault, and strongly recommended him to mercy. The Court, however, sentenced him to the maximum penalty allowed by the Code Civile, namely, imprisonment with hard labour for twelve months. The malheureux enfant, as it had become the fashion to call the murderer, was quite overcome at the dreadful sentence, and the effect on the public (with the exception of the coolies) is thus described by a local journal: ""The jurymen walk slowly; they are literally overwhelmed.
