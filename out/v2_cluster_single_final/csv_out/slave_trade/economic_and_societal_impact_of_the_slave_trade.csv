17,"The Kingdom of Dahomey played a pivotal role in the transatlantic slave trade, with its economy and the King's authority heavily reliant on the trade, while efforts to shift towards legitimate commerce and reduce demand were seen as potential strategies for its abolition.","The Kingdom of Dahomey played a pivotal role in the transatlantic slave trade, with its economy and the King's authority heavily reliant on this trade, as supported by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights Dahomey as one of the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading states in West Africa, with the slave trade being a mainstay of the ruling house. King Gezo's economic policy involved continuing the slave trade while also responding to the demand for palm oil as a substitute for slave exports, indicating a reliance on the slave trade and a gradual shift towards legitimate commerce. This transition to palm oil trade is noted as a significant economic change, reflecting efforts to adapt to abolitionist pressures and changing economic conditions. However, the textbook suggests that the shift towards legitimate trade was driven by economic necessity rather than a desire to abolish the slave trade. Similarly, The African Times articles describe the King's involvement in the slave trade, highlighting the shipment of slaves from Whydah to Cuba and the King's significant revenue from this trade. The articles mention the King's justification for the slave trade, blaming foreign buyers for its continuation, and note efforts to shift towards legitimate commerce, such as palm oil trade, though these efforts were insufficient to replace the economic benefits derived from the slave trade. The articles also discuss British attempts to negotiate with the King to abandon the slave trade, emphasizing the potential for legitimate commerce to provide alternative economic benefits, but express skepticism about the immediate success of these efforts due to the entrenched nature of the slave trade in Dahomey's economy and the King's authority. Both sources align in illustrating Dahomey's deep involvement in the slave trade and the challenges faced in transitioning to legitimate commerce.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that support the claim about the Kingdom of Dahomey's pivotal role in the transatlantic slave trade and its economy's reliance on it. The text highlights that Dahomey was traditionally considered one of the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading states in West Africa, with the slave trade being a mainstay of the ruling house.

The transition to palm oil trade is noted as a significant economic change, reflecting efforts to adapt to the abolitionist pressures and changing economic conditions. However, the text also notes that Dahomey continued the slave trade as long as there were customers, suggesting that the shift towards legitimate trade was not solely motivated by a desire to abolish the slave trade but also by economic necessity. The text does not explicitly state that efforts to shift towards legitimate commerce were seen as strategies for the abolition of the slave trade, but it does imply that economic adaptation was a response to external pressures, including the abolitionist movement. Overall, the textbook aligns with the claim regarding Dahomey's role in the slave trade and its economic reliance on it, while also acknowledging the gradual shift towards legitimate trade.","The African Times news articles provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that the Kingdom of Dahomey played a pivotal role in the transatlantic slave trade, with its economy and the King's authority heavily reliant on the trade.

Its adjustment to changing times was noticeable from the mid-century when, under the influence of a French trading firm, Victor RØgis, King Gezo (c. 1818-58) of Dahomey was persuaded to intensify the trade in palm oil, first as a supplement to the export of slaves and eventually as the dominant factor in the state's export economy.$^{41}$ The transition from slave to 'legi› timate' trade meant a corresponding increase in the need to retain war captives as labour for the maintenance and expansion of the palm oil industry. Slaves also came to be used more for transporting goods from the interior to the coast and vice-versa than as commodities for export. By the time of the French conquest of 1892-4, the foundation of Dahomey's new economy - the monoculture of palm produce - had already been laid. Developments in Dahomey mirrored those in other parts of the MonoNiger region where, as in Yorubaland, war captives who otherwise would have been sold for export overseas came to be used extensively as labour on farm plantations, or for transporting trade goods to and from the coast."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.779, 'probability_score': 0.054, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The new changes resulted from a combination of factors, including the nineteenth-century wars which, as in Yorubaland, had the effect of ren› dering the coastal areas relatively safe and attractive to migration from the hinterlands in which most of the fighting took place; the sea-borne trade which was rendered permanent by the transition from slave to 'legitimate' trade, thereby conferring a definite economic advantage on the coastal regions; and the steady growth of European interest, which enlarged the traditional role of selected coastal towns such as Lagos, Porto Novo and eventually Cotonou to take on new and increasing responsibilities not only as ports but also as political capitals of emergent colonial states and their independent African successors.\nIn all these changes, however, the economic factor would appear to have been the most dominant, especially with reference to the European presence. Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

The production areas, though sometimes 400-500 km distant, were mostly near the coast. Transactions were personal between local chiefs, caravaneers, brokers and agents. In Dahomey, on the other hand, the slave trade was one of the mainstays of the ruling house, which delegated the running of it to its chief vassals. In 1818 King Gezo, who was in debt to the Brazilian mulatto Francisco Felix Da Souza, appointed Da Souza as chacha, a 'white-man's chief who acted as an economic adviser and administrator of the Whydah trade. This office survived the death of the first chacha in 1849 and was inherited by Da Souza's son. It was management on a grand scale: the chachas kept a stock of Western goods, offset bookkeeping debits and credits, prepared cargoes in advance to facilitate speedy loading, collected taxes, checked the movements of white foreigners, and provided entertainment for their customers. This economic apparatus was capable of being adapted to other types of produce. Produce for the slave trade, which was in the hands of the chiefs, was secured by annual military expeditions, not always victorious, against the neighbouring countries, principally the Yoruba. It also came from the Central Sudan - whence captives were distributed, moreover, to the north and to Egypt - by caravans, which split up their loads at the border: the blacks earmarked for export, who were strong, were kept aside and incorporated in the ordinary porterage teams.$^{25}$ Further east, from Badagry to the borders of the kingdom of Benin, prolonged strife among the Yoruba people glutted the Whydah market. Local rulers and the black and white slave-traders of the lagoons supplied the heavy demand from the Portuguese and Brazilians, who made the best part of their fortune out of it before turning their hands to other kinds of trade. 26 East of Cape Formosa, among the rivers of the Niger delta from the Nun to Old Calabar, the slave trade was still run by the remarkable machinery that came into play in the last third of the eighteenth century, though this was already being applied to other types of trade that were carried on simultaneously.

The European anti-slave trade movement hit the state's economy, based as it was almost solely on the slave trade. However, Gezo's economic policy was to continue to respond to the demand for slaves from Portuguese dealers while at the same time responding to the stimulus of the export trade in palm oil as the ultimate substitute for slave exports.$^{22}$ These signs of the relative political and economic strength of Dahomey were becoming visible at the same time as symptoms of advanced decline were becoming increasingly apparent in Old Qyo.

But most of all, it caused fundamental changes more in the production than in the commercial arena.

Imports into Britain rose from 982 metric tonnes in 1814 to 21 000 tonnes in 1844, levelled off for ten years or so, and then doubled by 1870. France imported an average of 4000 tonnes a year between 1847 and 1856 and 2000 tons in the following decade. She compensated by importing an average of 8000 tonnes of groundnuts a year from Senegal and the Gambia plus 25 000 tonnes of 'tulucoona' nuts for the manufacture of household soap; these imports were worth 35 million gold francs in 1870. Something that had long been an abstract Utopian ideal - an alternative to the slave trade, a substitute for trade in men - had at last materialized. It remained to develop production on an industrial scale; and this took no longer than it had taken the Cuban and Brazilian plantations to reach full production of sugar and coffee. The main producing areas corresponded to the best slave-exporting areas, from Dahomey$^{44}$ to the rivers of the Niger delta and Cameroon. One of the essential features of the changeover was that manpower was mobilized on land that had been internally colonized. This admittedly meant that production was by means of a form of slavery, but within an African social and economic context. In fact the energetic development of this economic novelty did not immediately disrupt the traditional economy: slave trade and oil trade co-existed side by side. A more extensive system of barter began to radiate into the interior. On the coast the same agents for the Western trade still kept their grip on the market: they understood purchasing, gave credit, circulated traditional currencies, and introduced metal coinage. The increase in the number of people competing for trade upset the internal balance and led to a realign› ment of forces.$^{4S}$ These economic changes were accelerated by religious and cultural factors causing distortions, which were never very far removed from politics, which helped, however, to put an end to the trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.\nThis flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours. This route also linked Yorubaland with Borgu, Hausaland, Borno and beyond.

The internal forces were the primary mechanism of political evolution and the existing logics of development account for most of the particular details. Furthermore states were constructed in this same era which were quite remote from the world-economy as, for example, the Rozvi.$^{35}$ Also it is quite obvious, by looking at the West African states, that there is an imperfect connection between participation in the slave-trade and state-formation. If the two went hand to hand for Dahomey and Oyo, in Benin we had the formation of a strong state without such participation, and the inverse was true for the Niger delta. 36 The point, however, is a different one. It is that involvement in the world-economy required political structures that ensured the functioning of the economy; its commerce, its production, its labour-force supply.\nThe outside pressure was to have such structures.$^{37}$ Where the existing structures performed the necessary functions, for whatever reason, there was little pressure to change them. But, of course, the involvement in the world-economy increased the economic importance to given internal producers of sympathetic political structures. It is the internal producers who pressed to change the structures.$^{38}$ This led to various kinds of turmoil, which were of limited benefit to other participants in the world-economy. The latter in turn pressed for political stabilization, which took the form of creating states which participated in and were therefore constrained by the interstate system.$^{39}$ Ultimately, as we know, this led in most of Africa to the creation of colonial states. The abolition of the slave trade was a crucial political and economic event in this process. As plantation slavery and the slave trade were phenomena deriving from the operation of the capitalist world-economy, so was the abolition of the slave trade and of plantation slavery. I do not wish here to re-open the question of the importance of the abolitionists as a pressure group in this process. They of course existed and were part of the process. But the fact that such a pressure group existed and played a role in the process is not an explanation of the process but one of the aspects of it that needs to be explained.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'African reactions', 'content': ""Cliometricians, sociologists and historians agree that the slave trade was a complete catastrophe for Africa. Their learned observation endorses the popular view. But the proposition needs explanation. Humanitarianism is a Western ideology, and it is unlikely to have found any place in the minds of African distributors of the time - with very rare exceptions. But this does not mean that they were constitutionally incapable of giving up the trade, as Western supporters of slavery maintained. The continuance of the supply of exportable manpower from Africa can be logically explained in economic terms. That the distributors were black and the exporters white is irrelevant: it was a paying proposition, profitable to both trading partners, whose sole object was to make money. That was the situation at the grass roots. The continuance of the supply is to be explained in terms of the efficient working of an integrated system: and what Africans were resisting was the disruption of this system. For one thing, it would have ruined the established business of the distributors,$^{31}$ who had no other prospects, to say nothing of the chain of repercussions it would have set off on the social and political structure, both locally and further afield. In other words, so long as the barter system between the hinterland and the coast, and the coast's foreign trade, had no clear alternative to the slave trade, opposition by African slave-traders to its suppression was dictated strictly by the imperative needs to avoid commercial chaos.$^{32}$ The supposed complicity of the African distributors was no more than a reflex reaction to the immediate economic situation. This also explains the fall in the selling price of exportable manpower: it was the market's defence against growing pressure from the forces of suppression. The latter thus helped to contribute to an unsatisfactory situation. This argument needs to be modi› fied when the exportation of Africans to the north or east is considered. While the economic interests of the slave hunters and distributors are selfevident in this case too, it is hard to see what kind of economic compensa› tion accrued to the countries that were plundered.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports. Trade in the north was further stimulated by the abolition of the slave trade on the coast, the fact that the routes to the Fante country were closed from time to time, and the political stability of Hausaland and Borno after the djihad led by 'Uthmän dan Fodio.

Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

Whereas most slaves had probably been obtained through legal commerce in the preceding period, raiding and conquest replaced it as the dominant mode of acquisition. According to Chikunda traditions; for example, in the earlier phase of the slave trade they were able to purchase Nsenga, Chewa and Tonga slaves, many of whom were originally criminals, social outcasts or strangers. Subsequently, however, they used coercive tactics to satisfy the coastal demand. 34 Similarly, Yao itinerant traders initially exploited their access to cheap cloth and iron hoes to achieve a pre-eminent commercial position, but external pressures during the second half of the century motivated them to exert military pressure in the Shire valley in order to ensure their economic hegemony.$^{35}$ Makua participation in the slave trade underwent a parallel transformation while force had always been a component of the Arab-Swahili strategy. 36 To ensure a constant supply of captives and ivory, a number of trading groups carved out sizeable conquest states. Although differing in detail, these polities shared common characteristics that shaped their historical development. All these alien overlords relied heavily on European weapons to impose their hegemony and maintain their pre-eminence. These soph› isticated weapons were acquired in exchange for captives in an updated version of the gun-slave cycle. Once firmly entrenched, the alien ruling classes expanded the frontiers of their empire; while the amount of force varied, coercion was the dominant mechanism of incorporation. The new acquisitions provided additional sources of slaves and ivory, which were used to increase the size of their arsenals, thereby enabling further expan› sion.

In some cases the dominant class emerged stronger as a result of economic and military ties to the slave-traders. Consider relations between the Bemba rulers and the Arab and Swahili traders. Under the leadership of Chileshe Chipela the Bemba had just completed a phase of territorial expansion and political centralization when the foreign traders entered their homeland around i860. As a result, the Bemba kingdom was far more unified and powerful than most states in the region. The geographical position of the Bemba, somewhat removed from the principal trade routes, precluded the growth of a large and potentially seditious merchant community within the core of their kingdom. Equally important, there was no incentive for the Arab and Swahili traders to adopt a hostile posture since the Bemba were not economic rivals. Most of the royal families' wealth came from raiding and tribute in the form of ivory and slaves and they were happy to exchange them for the cloth and other imported goods provided by the coastal merchants. This economic complementarity fostered a harmonious relationship and simultaneously enhanced the internal position of the Bemba aristocracy, which used the foreign commodities to recruit new followers and strengthen their links to subordinate chiefs. The continued demand for captives and ivory also fuelled a new expansionist phase from i860 to 1880, during which Bemba forces conquered most of contemporary north-eastern Zambia. Thus, through ties to foreign merchants, the Bemba rulers gained unprecedented regional power while accumulating a substantial amount of wealth. 43 As in the case of the Bemba, other local chiefs and merchants entered into alliances with the slave-traders that proved extremely beneficial. Throughout the 1870s the Chewa chief, Mwase Kasungu, whose territory straddled the Lake Malawi-Katanga trade route, provided food for the Arab caravans in exchange for guns. These weapons enabled him to withstand the subsequent Mbwela Nguni invasions.$^{44}$ Economic con› siderations also motivated Arab and Swahili protection of the Senga chiefs, who were important suppliers of ivory.$^{45}$ Similar factors help explain Chikunda alliances with the Ambo against the Bemba, and assistance that they provided the Nsenga against the Soli, which occurred in the decade preceding the 'Scramble'.$^{46}$ In all these cases, it is clear that the aliens' strategy was to prevent"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': 'Perhaps the two best examples of this power shift occurred in the northern states of Undi and Kazembe. In both cases alliances between local mer› chants and foreign traders facilitated the circumvention of the royal mon› opoly and drastically weakened the position of the respective national leaders.$^{68}$ A similar pattern occurred in the kingdom of Kassanje, located in the adjacent territory of Angola. There the local matrilineages were able to gain control of the slave trade, at the expense of the royal family, leading to the rapid fragmentation of the state. 69 One by-product of greater commercial interaction was the substantial amount of cultural borrowing that occurred between different societies. The direction of change varied appreciably, depending on such factors as the nature and duration of contact between the trading groups and the host population. Where interaction was substantial, three broad patterns of acculturation occurred. In several instances, isolated bands of merchants and raiders became totally absorbed into the local society, as in the case of the Chikunda hunters, who were incorporated into Nsenga, Ambo and valley Tonga communities.$^{70}$ In sharply contrasting situations, the aliens profoundly altered the host culture. The Chewa subjects of Khota Khota, for example, absorbed aspects of Islam into their religion, adopted Swahili names, Swahili words and phrases, and underwent a major restructuring of their social system.$^{71}$ Similarly, many Yao traders converted to Islam and adopted coastal cultural patterns as a result of their contact with the Arabs. Their participation in long-distance trade also led to the growth of urban centres and the development of rituals and prohibitions designed to ensure the fidelity of Yao women while their husbands were in the interior, 72 suggesting that change also occurred as societies modified internal struc› tures to meet new external conditions. In addition to these two patterns of acculturation, there are indications that the fluid conditions facilitated the development of new ethnic and cultural groups. Several of the bands of Chikunda broke away from the decaying prazo system around the middle of the century and organized autonomous communities in the Luangwa valley. Attracting followers from a variety of disparate ethnic groups, they evolved a culture incorporating diverse Malawian and Shona institutions and values.$^{73}$ A parallel phenomenon occurred in the area of what is now eastern Zaire where the Manyema were transformed from a disparate band of slavers into a coherent social and cultural group. 74', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Omani penetration and the expansion of trade > The Mombasa hinterland routes', 'content': 'It appears that in the latter part of the nineteenth century, Arab and Swahili traders were strongly in control of the Kamba trade route. 16 This was because, having pushed through the Maasai country using the Kilimanjaro route (at a time when Maasai power was heavily affected by wars and epidemics), the coastal traders had been able to gain control of the sources of ivory.

For the sake of a few paltry hundreds a-year, this country, which is spending half-a-million annually on the naval squadron for suppressing the slave-trade, delivers over the people of an extensive region to this monster enormity. We called attention, some twelve months ago, to the active operations of the slavetraders at Quittah, since the virtual abandonment of that place by the British authorities. We stated then that many hundred slaves, from Ashantee and the Volta districts, had passed Quittah by the Lagoons and sea coast for shipment, at a place nearer to the King of Dahomey\'s port of Whydah, which our readers will see in our Dahoman news the King calls ""the English town of Whydah.""

We have by it become really implicated as a nation in that slave-trade which we are, at the same time, making such expensive efforts to suppress.

In this number of our journal we have also to record the painful news of an active foreign slave-trade at Whydah—of the shipment of nearly 1,000 poor wretches in one steamer, destined for the disgusting shambles of the modern plantations of Cuba, there to be used up in eight or ten years in the production of sugar for the British market. We cannot forget that, on those 1,000 slaves alone, the King obtains a fancied profit of some 10,000l., which we enable the Cuban planters to send him, through the slave-traders, for the supply of the raw material out of which they manufacture sugar for us. We are compelled to bear in mind that at the rate of duty he levies on palm oil shipped at Whydah—viz., one dollar per puncheon—there must be a very large exportation of produce to compensate him for relinquishing the slave-trade. We have also recently obtained a new insight into the dreadful ""Customs"" of Dahomey—of the supposed obligation on the part of the monarch to continue them during his life; and Aboekuta, though a hard nut, perhaps, to crack, has in its numerous population a delicious kernel for the wholesale butcher and slave-dealer. Nevertheless, we hail with joy this manifestation on the part of the King of a desire to enter into some amicable relations with the Christian civilization of this country. And we do indeed earnestly hope that advantage will be taken of it by Her Majesty\'s Government. We stated in our last that Commodore A. Eardley Wilmott had been furnished by them with the presents that would be requisite should he attempt a visit to Abomey. And we know his earnest desire to detach the King of Dahomey from the slave-trade. We have, therefore, reason to believe that when he receives, by the mail which leaves Liverpool to-morrow, this interesting intelligence, which has been communicated through us, he will lose no time but proceed to Whydah as soon as his other duties will permit. The King asks for the light to be brought to him; and such a desire ought to be immediately gratified. It may be only curiosity on his part, or a desire for the presents which he well knows he will receive; or to raise himself still higher in the opinion of his people, through that acknowledgment of him as king by this great nation; or it may be only a ruse on his part, to lull the Aboekutans into a fancied security, so that they may become an easier prey. Still, his desire ought to be complied with; the wishes, and, if necessary, the demands, of this Christian country ought to be diplomatically placed before him. The person whom he has named as interpreter should accompany the British negotiator. And then, should all fail—should no good result be obtained—we shall have at least the satisfaction that we performed our duty. We are not sanguine of any immediate good result, because we have no reason to believe that the negotiator has any power to promise a subsidy on the part of this country, which might compensate (until legitimate commerce should be largely developed) for the fancied pecuniary loss the King would sustain by the abandonment of the slave-trade. But we might expect to learn the amount of subsidy that would induce such abandonment; and it would then be for this country to determine whether it would be our duty or our interest to pay the price.'}, {'id': 109, 'article_title': 'REVENUE OF LAGOS.', 'full_section_title': 'REVENUE OF LAGOS.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1863#article-16', 'issue_date': '23_02_1863', 'content': ""\n\nWe feel particularly interested in the prosperity of Lagos, not only because we advised its annexation as a death blow to the slave-trade influences that prevailed there, but because of the evidence it affords that, should it become absolutely necessary in the interests of civilization and humanity, as well as of trade and industry, to occupy Whydah, our occupation of that place need not entail any permanent charge upon the Imperial revenues. We do not hesitate to say that 20,000l. a-year might be levied by duties on imports at Whydah. We do not wish to prejudge the results of Captain Willmott's visit to Abomey. Our correspondent at Whydah tells us that there is hope of amicable relations with Dahomey, and of the slave-trade being put an end to there. We are only too willing to share in this hope. But we think it right to show that, should the hope not be realised, there are still means for annihilating the slave-trade in the Bight of Benin, without any very heavy charge upon the home exchequer. And annihilated in the Bight of Benin the slave-trade never will be, while Cuba continues to import slaves, until the shipment of slaves from Dahomey and along the coast to the Volta be rendered impossible by the constant influence of British authority there. It is estimated that the revenue of the King of Dahomey from the slave-trade, and from licenses to trade and export duties at Whydah, amounts to 500,000 dollars a-year. One merchant at Whydah pays him 20,000 dollars a-year for a license to trade. It would be absurd for us to shut our eyes to these facts. If we cannot obtain the discontinuance of slave importation in Cuba, we must put an end to slave exportation from the coasts of Dahomey. And we understand that although the Kings of Porto Novo and Badagry are no longer mixed up actually with the slave-trade, they allow it to be carried on by Portuguese at their towns. And this reminds us that we have never yet received any explanation as to the grounds upon which we levy duties at Badagry. We give in another column a copy of a protest sent to Governor Freeman by the merchants of Badagry, when the duties, since modified and amended, were first ordered to be levied there. We do not defend the language employed by the protesting parties. But it shows that they were smarting under a keen sense of wrong done to them, according to their belief. We are not in possession of the Governor's reply to that protest. We must presume it will have shown the grounds on which he justified his order, and treated Badagry as a British possession, by levying duties there in the Queen's name, at a time when there was actually a British Vice-Consul there. We are aware that since the publication of our October article the Vice-Consul has been converted into a resident British agent; that his brother has been appointed magistrate; that a force of twelve native policemen are placed at the service of these authorities; and that the King and chiefs relinquish all right to levy duties, in consideration of a certain annual sum to be paid them by the Governor of Lagos.

In order that this affair may be quite understood, we may state that the celebrated slave clipper steamer Ciceron landed a cargo of slaves in Cuba, from Dahomey, of from 1,200 to 1,300 individuals. They were landed in the district over which Mr. Arguelles exercised authority as lieutenant-governor. Arguelles captured the whole cargo, and with them Senor Zulueta and other powerful individuals who are engaged as capitalists in the nefarious traffic. These persons, although caught ""in flagrante,"" although taken in the very act, have proved themselves to be sufficiently powerful to free themselves from all condemnation and to obtain the ruin of the man who had interfered with their unholy gains. There was a difference between the number of slaves seized and the number surrendered to the supreme authorities of the island. Zulueta and his worthy companions denounced Arguelles to the captain-general as having sold that number of slaves which constituted the difference alluded to. Arguelles maintains that the negroes thus deficient in the surrender were given by him to the parties to whom he is represented as having sold them—given by him for the aid and assistance rendered by those persons in effecting the capture, and as a price indeed agreed to be paid to them for that assistance. And considering the slave-trade morality of the island, this cannot be considered impossible. But as Zulueta and his brother slave-trade capitalists denounced Arguelles, so the persons who had thus received the slaves from Arguelles swore that they did not receive them as a gift, but that they paid from 700* to 750 dollars each for them, while Arguelles maintains that the only crime of which he has been guilty was in so far exceeding his instructions and the intentions of the chief authority, as to have captured such powerful people, such mighty slavetraders, as Zulueta and his friends. And we must say that the impunity which these people enjoy, although they were thus taken in the very act of having superintended the landing of the cargo, &c., of which they were proprietors, leads very strongly to the supposition, by those who know something of the purity of Spanish administration and of Spanish local law courts in such matters, that Arguelles may after all not be the guilty person he has been stated to be, and has been condemned as being. He is now a convict in the slave gang, while Zulueta and his friends are at liberty to arrange for retrieving the loss Arguelles inflicted on them in capturing an otherwise safely-landed cargo of 1,200 slaves, worth to them one million of dollars, or 200,000l.—to arrange for retrieving this by importing other cargoes in the Ciceron from Dahomey.'}, {'id': 444, 'article_title': 'DAHOMEY', 'full_section_title': 'DAHOMEY', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1864#article-8', 'issue_date': '23_09_1864', 'content': 'The coast was being closely watched by the English war steamers, to prevent the shipment of slaves.

Inquiry was now asked for, and it was true that inquiry had taken place in former days. Two royal commissions had sat with reference to this subject, but it was not necessary to refer to the report that had been made by the commissioners. In 1842 a select committee sat, presided over by Lord Stanley, now the Earl of Derby, and their inquiry arose principally from the fact that on the Gold Coast, which was then in the hands of a company, British merchants were in the habit of supplying slavers with requisites for carrying on their trade. The committee came to a conclusion, on which the House acted, that the Crown should resume the government of the settlement, but the question now was, whether the evil which then existed did not still continue; whether, in fact, the interest of resident merchants was not opposed to the object with which this country maintained the settlement. Committees of this House and of the House of Lords, with the more general view of inquiring into the best means of suppressing the slave-trade, subsequently sat—the inquiry which was now asked for would have the effect of eliciting whether in point of fact the maintenance of the four settlements was effectual, and how far it was so, for the suppression of traffic in slaves. For his part, he considered that the principle which was found to operate in ordinary commercial matters applied also to the slave-trade—namely, that the supply was regulated by the demand. (Hear, hear.) As long as there was an active demand for slaves, so long would there be a supply. A blockading squadron might add to the difficulty of carrying on the trade, but could not stop it. That was in fact beginning at the wrong end. The way to put down the trade effectually was to stop the demand for slaves. (Hear, hear.) He was happy to say that the demand was now confined solely to Cuba, and he believed that if pressure were put upon Spain to stop that demand, the slave-trade would be finally extinguished. It was a curious fact that the King of Dahomey saw that point much more clearly than Lord Russell did. The noble lord, in his instructions to Captain Burton last year, when that officer was about proceeding on a mission to Dahomey, said, ""Remind the King that he himself suggested that if we wished to put a stop to the slave-trade, we should prevent white men coming to buy them—(hear, hear)—and you will state that Her Majesty\'s Government, having determined that the traffic shall cease, will take steps effectually to stop the export of slaves."" The step suggested by the King of Dahomey will be found much more effectual in achieving that most desirable end than those adopted at great expense by this country. (Hear, hear.) He (Mr. Adderley) believed that before many years the Governments of America, France, and England would combine to put a pressure upon Spain that she could not resist, and that their efforts, which had been long and ineffectually made for the suppression of a nefarious system, would be followed by the adoption of a course which in one hour would crowned with success. He was glad to observe that the Spanish minister at Madrid was reported to have said that stringent measures were about to be adopted for the suppression of the slave-trade. If that promise were carried out the day was not distant—a day they would all rejoice to see—when the slave-trade would forever cease to exist. (Hear, hear.) But suppose that that day had arrived, with what object would the four settlements to which he had referred be maintained? Two objects had been assigned. One was for the promotion of legitimate commerce, and the other for the civilisation of the native races. With reference to the first, he very much doubted that the object in view would be realised by the means suggested, and he confidently appealed to the honourable member for Manchester (Mr. Bazley), and the honourable member for Salford (Mr. Cheetham), whether, representing as they did the trade associations of Manchester, they were not of opinion that the maintenance of the settlement would rather retard than promote legitimate commerce. The second was entirely a philanthropic object, and, if it could be achieved, he did not think any one in the House would complain of the keeping up of the settlement; but did the experience of the past afford encouragement for the future? In his opinion it did not. Missionary effort and voluntary action had been to some extent successful, but he was fortified by the opinion of one of the most experienced African missionaries that the existing governments planted by Great Britain on the West Coast of Africa were not any protection or assistance to missionaries. What course, then, ought the country to adopt? It was clear that we must go forward or go back; something more or less than had been heretofore done should be resolved on as the policy for the future. Either we must render our Government secure by the sending out of larger forces, the opening up of the country, the making of roads, and the extending of our power, or we must do much less than is done at present, and stand out of the way of the native chiefs, who, if we were not there, would have full control over their own subjects. The committee of 1842 led to the formation of four insignificant Governments, so small, that it might have been anticipated that they would have been jealous of each other, and instead of co-operating to effect the great object in view, were inclined rather to counteract each the operation of the other. It was, he thought, worthy of inquiry whether the present state of things should longer be allowed to exist, whether the Governments should not be concentrated, and our engagements and responsibilities contracted. On these grounds, therefore, he asked the House to grant the inquiry for which he sought, for the sake of the more effectual carrying out of the three great objects to which he had alluded—namely, the suppression of the slave-trade, the promotion of legitimate commerce, and the civilisation of the natives; be called on them to inquire whether the present system of government on the West Coast of Africa was working satisfactorily.

Lagos has for many years had a large trade carried on by British and other European merchants, yet this did not prevent it from being at the same time the head-quarters of slavery in the Bights. At Whydah an extensive trade in palm-oil has existed since 1849, and yet slaves have been regularly shipped from that port up to the present day, and, as has been already stated, a cargo was awaiting embarkation there in December last. Nor is this difficult to explain; palm-oil, which forms the principle article of trade, is collected by natives, chiefly domestic slaves, residing at or near the coast, its weight and bulk preventing it from being brought from a great distance in a country where there are no rivers; and it is evident that it would answer the chiefs better to turn their labour to account in this way than to sell them for exportation, even were not the customs of the country entirely opposed to such a proceeding. There is nothing, however, to prevent the chiefs from purchasing for export any number of the slaves captured in the hunts which are regularly undertaken for this purpose in certain parts of the interior, and so legitimate commerce and the slave-trade may be found combined in any spot on the coast to which British authority or influence does not extend.\n\nThus the existence of the British settlements, and of the Republic of Liberia, has served to eradicate the slave-trade from all but one spot on the 1,500 miles of coast extending from the Gambia to Quittah; and the recent acquisition of Lagos may be said to have freed almost entirely from the curse the remainder of the coast; the two exceptions being the small spot between the Gambia and Sierra Leone, the case of which has already been referred to in the report on the latter colony, and a portion of the sea coast lying between Quittah and Lagos, immediately in the rear of which are the dominions of the notorious King of Dahomey.\n\nIt is well known that, from the peculiar circumstances of his country, this monarch is indebted for his wealth and the maintenance of his authority over his people almost exclusively to the slave-trade. Whydah, the chief seaport of his dominions, is, as it has always been, the principal place of export; and advantage is also taken, when the vigilance of the cruisers renders it necessary, of the independent towns of Great Popo, Aghway, and Little Popo, situated to the westward, the inhabitants of which are only too ready to afford every facility for a trade from which they derive such profit.'}, {'id': 647, 'article_title': 'DAHOMEY', 'full_section_title': 'DAHOMEY', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_07_1865#article-7', 'issue_date': '22_07_1865', 'content': 'The King having been so successful in his expedition, the last great horrible custom is about to be performed—that is, the Gie-hole, or ""Beadshouse,"" is to be erected on the grave of the King\'s deceased father.

It is situated within the territory of the King of Dahomey, who, in the beginning of July, holds his annual butcheries of prisoners and slaves; and it is one of the crotchets of this grotesque monster to compel the heads of the European mercantile houses in Whydah to attend these feasts of blood at Abomey, his capital, on pain of having their factories or places of business closed, and being forced to quit the country. The European residents in Whydah, French and German as well as Portuguese, are very indignant at being compelled to witness these atrocities, and are anxious that England should occupy Whydah. This would be no difficult task, as it has British possessions on both sides of it, and, besides, the Dahoman monarch has become thoroughly afraid of the British Power since it crushed the Ashanti kingdom, which his grandfather, his father, and himself had in vain tried to conquer.

Little now-a-days, however, is heard of the doings of our fleet engaged in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans; and there are Englishmen who appear to be under the impression that a permanent stop has long been put to the trade in negro slaves. That such a notion is very far from the truth is only too clear, not only from certain official documents, but from the constant notices appearing in the local press published in the colonies on the Gold Coast. The Lagos Observer, for instance, announced in its issue of January 7 that no less than 700 negroes have just been deported as slaves from Whydah to St. Thomas, in South Africa. A few months before 1,200 slaves were ""openly shipped in the face of day by the Portuguese to the same place,"" under the pretext that they had been redeemed, and ""would be treated on their return as emigrants.""

The receipts from Portuguese stations show a falling off, which, however, is balanced by a corresponding increase in the guarantee received from Portugal. The receipts from French stations, owing to military operations in Dahomey, show an increase. The Capo joint-purse receipts also show an improvement, but owing to the falling-off in the traffic with South America and British stations, and also to the fact that we are making a comparison with a period when we carried a large amount of British traffic during the interruption of the African Direct Company's Lagos-Accra cable, the net increase in revenue is, as already mentioned, £509. We have again made a very heavy loss on exchange, which affects our revenue by over £8,000. The Portuguese Government have sanctioned our collecting at a higher rate on certain classes of traffic, but they have not admitted the principle of allowing us to collect at the higher rate on the whole traffic. The bulk of this loss is made in the remittance of the amount paid to us in Portugal by the Government on account of the guarantee. The total working expenses for 1892 amounted to £20,019, against £20,883, or a decrease of £864. We have, unfortunately, had to effect an exceptional number of repairs. The work has been carried out by the Eastern and the Eastern & South African Companies' ships at actual cost, but notwithstanding this arrangement, the expense has been very considerable—so much so, indeed, that the Directors consider it advisable to carry forward the small balance of £2,410 without distributing anything in the way of dividend. We have been obliged, since the date of these accounts, to incur further heavy expenses in connexion with the repair of the cable off the mouth of the Congo, but I trust when the work is carried out we shall be relieved from expenses of such an exceptional nature for some years to come. As a large proportion of revenue is derived from the joint-purse arrangement for the Cape traffic, it is essential that we maintain our link in the route to the Cape in a state of efficiency. The expenses in connexion with the diversion of our cable beyond the influence of the currents of the Congo will involve a considerable burden on this Company for some time to come, but we are convinced that this course will prove the most economical one, and be in the best interests of the Company. The most rigid economy is practised in management, and we look forward hopefully to better results in the future. These are the real facts of the case. The fact of this Company practically completing the cable system round Africa was always looked forward to with a great deal of satisfaction, and it is with much regret, therefore, that I am obliged to say we are not in a position to pay a dividend. There are two circumstances which have been against us, one of which is the heavy amount we lose by exchange. It is a very serious amount for a small Company like this, and we are trying to persuade the Portuguese Government to enable us not only by their own action in regard to the Government messages, but also with respect to the general messages, to recoup ourselves for the heavy loss we are now sustaining. The Government have refused to make any change in regard to their own messages, which I regard as an unfair view to take, and not in accordance with a strict reading of the agreement with the Government. We shall not fail to keep pressing on them to do us full and fair justice. The next important difficulty we have had to contend with, and which we have gone into most carefully, is in regard to the diversion of the cable mentioned in the report off the river Congo. We have decided to divert that cable, which at the present moment crosses the mouth of the Congo. We find there are under-currents in such rivers which we cannot understand, and their influence is injurious. We have, therefore, decided to carry this cable about 140 miles out to sea, so as to be free of the action of these under-currents. The removal will cost a good deal of money, but we hope it will enable us to give a certain service, and to secure the company from interruptions and breaks.""}]","[{'document_title': 'CAPE COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The King will now be able to estimate at its proper value the good advice given to him by Commodore Wilmot fifteen months ago. He was warned that he had no chance of success against such a town as that of Abeokuta, defended by such people as the Egbas, assisted by a powerful Ojimbo* element. But the vanity and pride of the King and his army were so inflamed, that nothing short of a disastrous defeat such as that they have now sustained would have sufficed to make them abandon their purpose. Abeokuta was too hard a nut for them to crack. They would not believe this, and have broken their jawbone in the effort. For there can be no doubt as regards the result. Dahomey has received a check that may be fatal to her existence as a kingdom unless she abandon that atrocious system under which her own population has continually decreased, and that of neighbouring districts has been annihilated. Unless she discontinue the constant and horrible waste of human life for which she has become so infamously celebrated—get rid of the foreign slave-dealers from her coasts—rigidly prohibit the export of another slave—and cultivate the arts of peace with all the power of her remaining population in lieu of the destructive ones of war—unless she do this, she is lost.

We believe that if he were now at Abomey, he could have induced that change of system which we so ardently desire. Dahomey is especially marked out by nature for a vast cotton field, stretching thence across Yoruba. Unlike the western settlements of the Gold Coast, hers is an open, and not a forest country; the soil, which can be very easily cleared, is particularly favourable to the cotton plant, which here becomes perennial, and produces two crops a-year, with very easy and inexpensive culture; and if the King and his chiefs would direct the energies of his really agriculturally-inclined people to the production of cotton, he might save his country, his coffers would soon be much better filled than they have ever been by the slave-trade, and the value which human life would acquire in the eyes of all would induce the speedy abandonment of every vestige of those horrible customs where human blood has been spilled like water, and human agony has been feasted on by a savage people as if they were a host of fiends.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-04-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1864#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Hope in Dahomey', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'she has been so richly endowed by nature. In this number of our journal we have also to record the painful news of an active foreign slave-trade at Whydah—of the shipment of nearly 1,000 poor wretches in one steamer, destined for the disgusting shambles of the modern plantations of Cuba, there to be used up in eight or ten years in the production of sugar for the British market. We cannot forget that, on those 1,000 slaves alone, the King obtains a fancied profit of some 10,000l., which we enable the Cuban planters to send him, through the slave-traders, for the supply of the raw material out of which they manufacture sugar for us. We are compelled to bear in mind that at the rate of duty he levies on palm oil shipped at Whydah—viz., one dollar per puncheon—there must be a very large exportation of produce to compensate him for relinquishing the slave-trade. We have also recently obtained a new insight into the dreadful ""Customs"" of Dahomey—of the supposed obligation on the part of the monarch to continue them during his life; and Aboekuta, though a hard nut, perhaps, to crack, has in its numerous population a delicious kernel for the wholesale butcher and slave-dealer. Nevertheless, we hail with joy this manifestation on the part of the King of a desire to enter into some amicable relations with the Christian civilization of this country. And we do indeed earnestly hope that advantage will be taken of it by Her Majesty\'s Government. We stated in our last that Commodore A. Eardley Wilmott had been furnished by them with the presents that would be requisite should he attempt a visit to Abomey. And we know his earnest desire to detach the King of Dahomey from the slave-trade. We have, therefore, reason to believe that when he receives, by the mail which leaves Liverpool to-morrow, this interesting intelligence, which has been communicated through us, he will lose no time but proceed to Whydah as soon as his other duties will permit. The King asks for the light to be brought to him; and such a desire ought to be immediately gratified. It may be only curiosity on his part, or a desire for the presents which he well knows he will receive; or to raise himself still higher in the opinion of his people, through that acknowledgment of him as king by this great nation; or it may be only a ruse on his part, to lull the Aboekutans into a fancied security, so that they may become an easier prey. Still, his desire ought to be complied with; the wishes, and, if necessary, the demands, of this Christian country ought to be diplomatically placed before him. The person whom he has named as interpreter should accompany the British negotiator. And then, should all fail—should no good result be obtained—we shall have at least the satisfaction that we performed our duty. We are not sanguine of any immediate good result, because we have no reason to believe that the negotiator has any power to promise a subsidy on the part of this country, which might compensate (until legitimate commerce should be largely developed) for the fancied pecuniary loss the King would sustain by the abandonment of the slave-trade.

The African-Aid Society have especially reason to congratulate themselves on the justness of their views with regard to Dahomey. It is now more than two years since they memorialised Her Majesty's Government to send a commissioner to the King of that country. Although assailed on all sides by doubts as to the personal safety of any person who might be thus sent, they have never wavered, and at every convenient opportunity have reiterated that request. Their information respecting both King and people was too certain to allow them to participate in any fear. They knew that what the King desired in his heart, above all other things, was, that some Englishman, clothed with command, and bringing a direct message from the British Government, should come to him. His pride and dignity were involved in his obtaining this virtual recognition from England, similar to that which his father had received. Their memorial prayed, moreover, that, if necessary, a subsidy might be granted to the King, to cease whenever legitimate trade should have brought him a revenue equal to that he would have abandoned in giving up and assisting us in destroying the slave-trade, at our request.\n\nThe reception of Commodore Wilmot by the King of Dahomey, his chiefs and people, has set at rest the question of the accessibility of that monarch to the remonstrances and counsels of England. Our prestige there is very great. All were jealous of the preference which we seemed to give to Abeokuta. That envenomed the feelings of the Dahomans against the Abeokutans, and the very decided terms in which the former spoke to Commodore Wilmot on the subject show that there is but little chance of peace between the two until the issues of another foray into the Egba country shall have been tried. We deeply deplore that Commodore Wilmot could not obtain an abandonment of the King's designs against Abeokuta. But, notwithstanding the state of isolation from England in which the Abeokutans have placed themselves, by their unjustifiable and offensive rejection of Mr. Vice-Consul Taylor, and their subsequent proceedings, they ought to be perfectly able to protect their town against troops on whom a three weeks' march without commissariat supplies must tell with most enfeebling effect."", 'last_edit_date': '1863-03-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1863#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'DAHOMEY: ITS KING AND PEOPLE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The King of Dahomey has not realized the expectations we last month hazarded respecting him. Those expectations were formed on the supposition that he might possess some few grains of common sense, which would place vividly before his mental vision the dangers of collision between an earthen pot and a sledge hammer wielded by an arm of power. It seems to be now past dispute that, instead of disowning the acts of the brutal authorities at Whydah, who showed themselves to be fit servants to such a master, he has put a bold front on the matter, and sent the insolent message that ""he will pay the Commodore in powder and bullets if he will come up to Abomey."" This is the language that might be expected only from a doomed idiot, vapouring among the spiritless slaves by whom he may be surrounded, and who have worshipped him as almost a god, until he believes himself to be quite one. It is clearly full time that both King and people should be undeceived by coming in rude contact with something more than a few European trading clerks and agents, who, naturally enough, in the interests of their trade, submit, uncomplainingly, to everything short of actual plunder and brutal violence. Our opinions and feelings respecting the frantic iniquity of Dahomey are so strong, and our conviction that it is the imperative duty of Great Britain, as the real protecting Power on the West Coast of Africa, to put a final end to its enormities as being a daily insult to humanity, is so unalterable, that all we can say in reply to the braggart King is that we hope he will continue in his present frame of mind, and not be moved to feigned repentance by the blockade of his sea-ports. We do not wish him to repent, and thus save himself and his authority from destruction—unless his repentance should go so far (which it never would do) as to secure his faithful acquiescence in British demands, that he should never henceforth make any inroads into Egba territories in search of victims for his atrocious festivals, and that those festivals of blood should be entirely put an end to. The earth has groaned long enough under this blood-thirsty monster, and the devilish system that he at this time represents. That system is incurable by any other means than the entire destruction of the Power with which it is identified, and of which it is an inseparable part. The late King, and the present also, more than once declared to Europeans who have been on missions to Abomey, that even were he desirous of doing so, he could not discontinue that perpetual series of human sacrifices in which his people delight; that his prestige would be gone, and that he in his turn would be a victim if he ceased to justify by deeds his title of ""Man-slayer."" There is possibly truth in this. The people, like their King, are accustomed to sniff the, to them, intoxicating odour of the reeking blood of victims slaughtered before their eyes, and would object to be deprived of a gratification they have so long enjoyed. Under such circumstances there is only one way of purifying the horribly polluted atmosphere of Dahomey, and that is by bringing a superior force to bear upon King, people, and institutions. As already stated, we have ourselves always held the opinion that it was the duty of a civilized Christian Power such as Great Britain to interfere in the interests of humanity. There are now other interests, in addition to those of mere humanity, urging and impelling to the work. Not only has one of her subjects been grievously maltreated, but the financial interests of the Gold Coast Colony are very prejudicially interfered with by the action of Dahomey as a marauding State. The yearly armed expeditions into the Egba territories, even up to the immediate neighbourhood of Abeokuta, in quest of plunder and victims for sacrifice in the ""Customs,"" inflict very great injury not only on the industrious Egba agriculturists, but also, as a necessary result, on the revenues of Lagos. There is an annual scare in the Egba territories. Farms are deserted, the people take refuge in Abeokuta, and their property is wasted and destroyed. We feel sure that we do not exaggerate when we say that were those marauding inroads to cease, and to cease at the absurd certainty that there will not be any renewal of them, agricultural industry will take so great a development in the Egba countries that the production would be doubled, with corresponding advantage to the', 'last_edit_date': '1876-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1876#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'DAHOMEY: ITS KING AND PEOPLE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""trade and revenue of Lagos. It has therefore, we think, become imperative on Great Britain not only to demand the full payment of the fine justly imposed by Sir William Hewett, but to insist also on such other conditions as the legitimate interests of the neighbouring British settlements may seem to require. We were, therefore, glad to see, and we congratulate Sir William Hewett, that there was so strong an expression on both sides in the House of Lords that there could not be any withdrawal of our just demands; and that if his Majesty of Dahomey continue intractable, effective measures should be adopted. Some sort of apprehension has been felt that should it become necessary to proceed to extremities with King Gelélé, there would be something like a renewal of preparations such as preceded the march of our soldiers to Coomassie. But this is a mistake. Abomey is much more easy of access from the coast than is Coomassie. Instead of being 190 miles from Whydah, or from Porto Novo, as Coomassie is from Cape Coast Castle, Abomey, the capital of Dahomey—where the King usually resides, and where the sacrificial atrocities are committed—is not much, if any, more than ninety miles from Whydah or Porto Novo. Unlike Ashanti, which is so densely wooded, Dahomey is, for the most part, an open country; while the roads for many miles around Abomey are broad and good—have been represented, indeed, by European visitors as fully equal to the best English high roads. There is only one difficulty, in the shape of a swamp, through which the paths are narrow, and which is almost impassable during the rainy season; but any advance into the interior on our part would not be made during that season, and the swamp, we believe, may be turned, without any great increase of distance to be traversed. As regards forces, those of Dahomey are not fit in any way to be put in comparison with those of Ashanti which were encountered during the march on Coomassie. With the exception of his Amazons, the King of Dahomey has very few dependable troops, while neither Amazons nor the others are fit to stand five minutes against the well-trained Houssas which we could now send against them, to say nothing of the few hundred blue jackets that the Fleet would furnish. Like the Ashantees, the Dahomans have neither artillery nor rocket tubes, and could not at all contend with such formidable weapons. Our own impression is that in the event of an advance on Abomey, there would be very little bloodshed. With the exception of those who constitute the armed force of Dahomey, the country groans under a tyranny from which it would gladly embrace an opportunity to escape. The Dahomans proper conquered the territories over which they now tyrannize; and the heavy blood tribute they have demanded from the people, with other exactions of the most galling nature, especially those connected with the formation and maintenance of the privileged Amazon corps, has prevented the growth of any real attachment between the governing power and its subjects; and it would not in any way surprise us should the advance of British forces on Abomey, with one defeat of the King's army, be the signal for a general rising of the agricultural population, to wreak their just vengeance on oppressors whose sins against humanity have been of so deep a dye. By the order published in the Gazette of the 23rd May, the blockade of the Dahoman ports by Her Majesty's ships, under the command of Sir William Hewett, will commence on the 1st of July, should the fine imposed by the Commodore not be previously paid. We do not think that the extension of time for payment (the blockade was to have begun on the 1st of June) will bring any additional advantages to the King. There is time, it is true, for the steamer which left Liverpool on Saturday last to land cargo at Whydah, and the other ports mentioned in the Government notice, before the blockade will commence. Merchants, however, we should think—even including Messrs. Regis, of Marseilles—will be more anxious about the safety or safe removal of property they may now have on shore there than to incur the risk of increasing their ventures within the Dahoman territory. We approve, therefore, on every ground of the extension of time thus accorded. It may save the property of British merchants by giving them longer time for its sale or removal; it gives the King longer opportunity for reflection, which, however, as we have above said, we hope he will not be wise enough to turn to good account for his own safety; while, if ulterior measures become necessary, it will enable all requisite arrangements to be made, so that everything shall be in readiness in October, when the rains will have ceased, and the country have pretty well recovered from their effects so far as regards its condition to be traversed by an armed force. We shall now wait the arrival of successive steamers from the Coast with greatly increased interest, but at the same time with a feeling of certainty that whatever may be the course pursued by the King, the blockading squadron, or a subsequent expedition, the ultimate result of the present difficulty will be the creation of additional facilities for the spread of Christian civilization within territories where the blackest rites of the most blood-thirsty of superstitions have been hitherto practised without intermission, hindrance, or remorse."", 'last_edit_date': '1876-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1876#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The New Route to Abomey, the Capital of Dahomey', 'section_title': '', 'content': '### TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.\n\nLagos, November 16, 1876.\n\nSir,—I am moved by patriotic feeling to support the true and godly statements in the columns of the October number of your journal by one Mr. ""Otitor Koro""—viz., ""The extensive Slave-trade Practi.es in Lagos.""

The slaves were marched up to the Government House; the Governor having consulted his courtiers and adviser, ordered their names to be recorded, and _delivered them back to their respective owners._ Not a word of warning was said to these owners for buying slaves privately. Considering this place to be a thorough British settlement, I was perfectly astounded at this impolitic act of his. This cruel practice had been long carried on in this settlement. Traders and merchants are in the habit of receiving slaves as payment from their debtors, and have them privately shipped to Porto Novo and Oke Odon for sale.

All this is changed by the Treaty. British subjects have now a recognized station; they may visit, reside, and trade in Dahomey as of right; they are not to be annoyed, or inconvenienced, or impeded in their trade, either by the King of Dahomey, his subjects, or any foreigners within his dominions; and they may hire, occupy, and possess any houses or warehouses for the purposes of commerce. We do not underrate, nor do we think those engaged, or to be hereafter engaged, in commerce and trade with and in Dahomey will underrate the importance of these stipulations. We should have been glad, however, to see an additional one, which is unhappily absent, to the effect that no British subject, or his goods or produce, should be liable to any additional or increased payment or exaction over and above what may be demanded and taken from the subjects of any other foreign Power. The position and influence in Dahomey of the subjects of one other European Power—a position and influence dating from the time of the foreign slavetrade—rendered, we think, a ""most favoured nation"" clause as desirable in this treaty with Dahomey as in other treaties in which it has been from time to time inserted. The confirmation of pre-existing stipulations as regards the foreign slave-trade, was a matter of course. No British negotiations treating with such a State as Dahomey could possibly fail to reassert the determined opposition of Her Majesty\'s Government to any renewal of that odious traffic in human flesh, now, happily, almost extinct, so far as the West Coast of Africa is concerned; although during the last twelve months, and, unhappily, even in our last and this present number, we have had to expose desultory individual efforts, on the part, too, of British subjects, to revive and perpetuate it. But our most hearty thanks are due to Her Majesty\'s Government and to Commodore Sullivan for the stipulation in Article 6. Although unable, at present, to force the discontinuance of human sacrifices in Dahomey, it was well to place on record anew the British abhorrence of them, by demanding and obtaining for British subjects an exemption from those horrible commands which the King of Dahomey has been accustomed to make and enforce on Europeans at Whydah, that they should attend his abominable Customs, in which so many poor creatures are tortured and sacrificed, at the behests of a bloodthirsty superstition. Article 6 stipulates that ""no British subject shall henceforth be compelled to attend any of the Customs of the country of Dahomey where any human sacrifices are held."" This stipulation alone, even if the Treaty had not contained those other important ones on which we have commented, would have amply justified the remission of a portion of the fine imposed by Sir William Hewett, and to enforce payment of which the Dahoman coast was blockaded. Such a stipulation is cheap at 100 puncheons of oil; and we are quite sure Her Majesty\'s Government would have abandoned all claim to the other 400 puncheons, and even made an annual payment out of the Imperial Exchequer in addition, if King Gélélé would have undertaken, in consideration thereof, to abolish those human sacrifices which cause every humane mind to think of Dahomey with disgust and loathing. Article 6, however, is an insertion of the ""thin end of the wedge"" as regards that ruinous waste of human life, which makes Dahomey a curse, as well as an abomination, to her less bloodthirsty neighbours, and is tending rapidly to her own impoverishment, depopulation, and ruin.', 'last_edit_date': '1877-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1877#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The New Route to Abomey, the Capital of Dahomey', 'section_title': '', 'content': '## THE SLAVE-TRADE IN LAGOS.', 'last_edit_date': '1877-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1877#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'advantageous.

Since then all opposition and oppression by the white agents or merchants has been checked, and the black traders are privileged to do business at Bonny Town. The same thing is now occurring at Opobo River. The same firms that are doing business in Bonny River are doing business at Opobo.

Are they doing something contrary to the English Government, or something against their employers at home?

They know it to be impossible for the black traders to build houses on the beach, for if they did there would be no capital remaining for the black traders to go on with. The King has disposed of their objection by saying that there is no positive decree against any merchants or traders doing business in the town; that it is a matter of option where a man chooses to carry on his business; that the white agents and merchants had once built a house in the town of Opobo, but for reasons of health they removed to the beach; and if the town of Opobo is healthy for the black traders, why should the white men oppose their being there?

These characteristics made it particularly vulnerable to the destructive effects of the slave trade, since there were no large states able to protect their citizens. Rather, the various Igbo communities would appear to have engaged in inter-group wars, raids, and kidnappings for slaves to sell to the delta states and the Efik of Calabar, who served as middlemen. That is, although Igboland provided most of the slaves sold at the ports of Bonny, and Elem Kalahari, in the Niger delta, and at Calabar on the Cross river estuary, the Igbo did not come into direct contact with the Europeans before the nineteenth century. Also, the Igbo country was not reached by visiting Europeans until the closing years of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century. And these initial contacts took place along such river routes as the Niger, the Imo, and the Cross river. Thus the communities at the market centres on the rivers at which the coastal middlemen met hinterland traders became better known than others. The Aro who controlled the internal trade routes and some of the markets at which the coastal middlemen purchased slaves and, later, palm oil and palm kernels became notorious for their abilities both as traders and as the operators of a well-reputed oracle. Similarly, the Ndoki towns of Akwette and Ohombele on the Imo river served as the markets for Bonny and Opobo. On the Niger, the states of Aboh, Osomari, Oguta, Asaba, and Onitsha provided market centres which were the foci for external influences and contacts.\nAlthough the Atlantic slave trade was formally abolished by the British in 1807, it lingered on on the coast till about 1850. And for the rest of the century, the internal trade for slaves among the coastal peoples increased because of the demands of the palm-oil trade. Similar demands for man› power in the production of palm oil and palm kernels, as for crop farming and ritual services, encouraged the continuance of the internal slave trade within Igboland.$^{8}$ Accordingly, the slave trade and slavery must be con› sidered an important factor for social change in Igboland for most of the nineteenth century.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.637, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': ""the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

But this does not mean that they were constitutionally incapable of giving up the trade, as Western supporters of slavery maintained. The continuance of the supply of exportable manpower from Africa can be logically explained in economic terms. That the distributors were black and the exporters white is irrelevant: it was a paying proposition, profitable to both trading partners, whose sole object was to make money. That was the situation at the grass roots. The continuance of the supply is to be explained in terms of the efficient working of an integrated system: and what Africans were resisting was the disruption of this system. For one thing, it would have ruined the established business of the distributors,$^{31}$ who had no other prospects, to say nothing of the chain of repercussions it would have set off on the social and political structure, both locally and further afield. In other words, so long as the barter system between the hinterland and the coast, and the coast's foreign trade, had no clear alternative to the slave trade, opposition by African slave-traders to its suppression was dictated strictly by the imperative needs to avoid commercial chaos.$^{32}$ The supposed complicity of the African distributors was no more than a reflex reaction to the immediate economic situation. This also explains the fall in the selling price of exportable manpower: it was the market's defence against growing pressure from the forces of suppression. The latter thus helped to contribute to an unsatisfactory situation. This argument needs to be modi› fied when the exportation of Africans to the north or east is considered. While the economic interests of the slave hunters and distributors are selfevident in this case too, it is hard to see what kind of economic compensa› tion accrued to the countries that were plundered.

Up to the 1840s the slave trade was by far the most important Portuguese-African activity. This last peak period was in fact the most disastrous in the history of the Angolan slave trade. It is estimated that from 1780 to 1830, between 15000 and 20000 slaves were exported annually from Central African ports (from the Loango coast to the south of Angola).

The slave trade was of course a product of, and a key element in, the construction of the European-centred capitalist world-economy that had come into existence c. 1450. By the seventeenth century this capitalist world-economy included as part of its peripheral production areas the 'extended' Caribbean zone of the Americas. In this zone, the expanding plantation systems (especially sugar, but also tobacco, cotton, and other products) came to depend increasingly for their manpower on slaves who were 'captured' in West and Central Africa and transported across the Atlantic.\nShould this long-distance trade in slaves be classified as 'luxury' trade or as trade in 'essentials'? Can it be said to have involved the 'production' of manpower for the capitalist world-economy? And should therefore the 'producing' zones be seen as peripheral areas of this capitalist worldeconomy? There is no simple answer to these queries. In terms of numbers exported there was an upward curve in the slave trade from 1450 to 1800, with a significant increase c. 1650.

The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda.

In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars.

European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated.

He states that the slave-trade is still carried on there, though the King does not sanction it himself.

In Jeddah they are sold in public market. The Vice-Consul found the climate of the Abyssinian coast in the summer, as he mildly says, ""not adapted for a European constitution."" He can compare it to nothing but a vast furnace, with not a leaf or a blade of grass surviving, and where it is impossible to find rest day or night. The temperature ranges from 115 deg. to 120 deg. in the shade. Even the Abyssinians from the interior cannot live in this climate for any length of time during the heat; the Vice-Consul bought a horse just brought from Ireland, but in two months it had gradually sunk under the change. When the rains set in, and the moisture of the earth, long suppressed, is suddenly restored, the herbage which springs up is at first poisonous, and mules often die from eating it. The Vice-Consul seems to have resided at Massowah, a coral island about 200 yards from the main land. While he was there the French purchased a place called Obokt, situated between Leila and the Babelmandel coast, from the Dunkalie Chief, and gave him 10,000 dollars for it. The Chief of the village, after receiving the money, disappeared, and his successor did not countenance the claim or right of the French to purchase this site, nor of the Chief to dispose of it, and the few huts that were erected by the French on that coast while occupied in surveying were, after their departure, thrown into the sea by the natives.'}, {'id': 319, 'article_title': 'Quittah', 'full_section_title': 'Quittah', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1864#article-7', 'issue_date': '23_02_1864', 'content': ""TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.\n\nSir,—All the evils of which I before complained to you still exist.

He was at the same time, as we heard, to carry on the duties of under-gaoler there, which requires a person who understands how to write a little; and Blavo, not knowing how to write, did not like the situation at all. It is very probable that his uncle, Mr. Lawson, at Sierra Leone, hearing that his nephew, Blavo, was removed from a place which he had by some plausible scheme got Sir Arthur to fix him (for Blavo was one of the policemen who came over with that Governor on his visit to this quarter during his administration), made a fresh stir for his nephew, and, by the same contrivance, got our good Governor Hennessy to send Blavo back here again; and that\'s the end of the whole matter. Blavo has now come to his home the second time, to sit down among his family and receive his pay. I cannot blame the Governor-General if he has given his consent to Blavo\'s return, for, though he is good and wise, yet he is not an angel, to see through everything; but it would be a little better if Blavo\'s presence here was of the least benefit to anyone, or even if he knew what passes here. The Ashantis are at present blocked up on every side further west, and find their way down here to their allies, the Ahwoonahs. It is, therefore, no wonder that messengers come from the Ashanti monarch to the chiefs here now and then—upon some errand, of course.

I did not at once perceive the situation, but noticed the embarrassment of the men, the presence of several very young children (infants) which they were carrying, and that the caravan, instead of passing us in the broad path, was disappearing man by man as they came up into the jungle. I demanded the reason for these things and accused them of being a slave caravan, which they strongly denied. I took away their guns and made them prisoners till I should prove the truth of their words, and sent Mr. Wilson on ahead to ascertain what he could, and capture any if he found they were a slave caravan. Mr. de Winton searched the bush, and I returned to the rear of the Safari to send word back to Shukri and the search party (who had returned to our previous camp to look for the missing Soudanese) to be on the look out and capture all they could. We found it was undoubtedly a slave caravan. The headman in front says he saw fifteen girls in slave sticks, and we captured and liberated one man in a slave stick, and also found one woman slave and three young children, two being emaciated with starvation. These I took on with me, together with a number of prisoners we captured. The common porters I released (taking away their arms), and retained two men of superior rank and a boy as evidence. These men I sent down to the coast under Mr. Auburn\'s charge as prisoners from the Kibwezi, together with full details and evidence gathered from them and from the other prisoners whom I had released as to the names of the owners and leaders of the caravan, &c.

Rohlfs crossed the Fezzan, many things were related to him respecting the local administration. He was witness at that time of the following scene:—On a certain day, the doctor of the garrison presented himself at the residence of M. Rohlfs, begging him to dismiss his servant, and to close the door; he then entered upon the subject of the slave trade, and, according to his statement, there was an understanding between the authorities and the slave traders. These latter only guide their convoys by night. As soon as the caravan arrives, the corporal of the watch begins to count heads; the Kobrassi presides at the opening of the city gates, and the Kaimakan receives a report; he, as governor, demands this, because his perquisite is the sum of two mahbouds (ten francs, or about eight shillings English money) per slave; this is regarded as a small gratuity for his son-in-law, Kaivasbacha. This contraband proceeding must be very profitable, if we are to believe the good doctor. The Kaimakan had allowed at least four thousand slaves to pass through the city of Mourzouk in 1865, but the number might have amounted to ten thousand when crossed the Oasis. This information was of the greatest importance; but it is sad to be obliged to say, that in giving it, the doctor acted not from a feeling of humanity, but merely from jealousy; in this work of lucrative deception, the Kaimakan had not given a single mahboud either to the Kobrassi or to the doctor.\n\nThis, then, is the manner in which the slave trade is continued in defiance of all laws. Though the law condemns it, public opinion sees in it only a national institution which it is not forced to give up; the authorities shut their eyes, or favour a commerce that assures to them handsome revenues. As for the supervision of European Powers, it has been as nothing for many years past. The consuls confine themselves to the principal ports on the coast, where the traffickers never come; the consular agents, in the interior, are not always wisely chosen, so that their surveillance is not efficient; both parties frequently fail with respect to the knowledge necessary to render it so.\n\nIt seems established by evidence that the traffic in slaves, far from decreasing, is more flourishing than ever. An old inhabitant of Kouka declares, that during the last twenty years a greater number had been sent from Bornou than had been, previously, for one hundred years.\n\nThe merchants, whom the police of Europe disturbed in some places, no doubt, concluded that their traffic would be less interfered with beyond the solitudes of Sahara.\n\n*(To be continued.)*', 'last_edit_date': '1872-10-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1872#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.631, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COMMERCIAL COMPANIES FOR AFRICAN TRADE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'But it takes so long to undo evil, and destroy its baneful venom among mankind, that the infamous slave-trade, though scotched, is not yet killed.

In the countries contiguous trade has been brought to a complete standstill for nearly two years past by these slave raids, and the Government (at least, until the re-appointment of Sir Samuel Rowe) has done nothing effectual to stop them. In the Sulymah and Gallinas countries, almost within sight of British officials, the slaughter of the helpless, and the capture of prisoners for slavery, have been so extensive that the countries are almost depopulated. Why, if England be really in earnest, is the country where we have had a footing for so long, left, while openings are being sought elsewhere? No one can object to an effort to stop slavery on the Congo and the Nile, but this place should have first attention. It must be admitted that we have already induced all the native chiefs to agree to put an end to slavery, but they do not carry out their agreements, and we do not attempt to compel them. To do so would be a very easy task, for which no five thousand pounds a year would be wanted, and little or no force, but a great deal of firmness.

Since 1872, a year which has been proverbial for all but what is good and prosperous for this Settlement as well as for its inhabitants, the demon of slavery, which it was thought at and after the cession had received its death-blow, has been gradually recovering, and is now, I am sorry to say, in almost its wonted strength, but very much disguised; to wit—prior to the year in question, although the interior countries were one amphitheatre of war, yet the captives taken at the wars hardly found their way here except as fugitives from their masters; but now the case is altered—instead of legitimate produce being brought to the Ejinrin and the Tkorodu markets, and instead of the Lagos', 'last_edit_date': '1876-08-08', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1876#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.623, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East and Central Africa Foreign Slave Trade', 'section_title': '', 'content': '**THE SLAVE TRADE IN AFRICA IN 1872.**\n\n*CHAPTER I.*\n\n*CENTRAL AFRICA.*\n\nIn the first step we take in the examination of this great subject, we find in the train of the man-hunters horrors which were unknown to the former slave trade.\n\nWhen the negro was brought to the coasts of Guinea, to be sold to the American purchasers, he had not to make long days\' marches across the dreadful solitudes of Sahara. In the new traffic, organised for the markets of the East, the black that has just been severed from his family and deprived of his liberty, while suffering unheard-of cruelties, must traverse the vast plains of sand which separate the interior of Africa from the borders of the Mediterranean, in order to arrive at the place of his future servile existence.\n\nThe desert, with its scorching sands, devoid of verdure and springs, with its storm-driven dust that buries caravans, seems more terrible than the ocean, and to cross it requires a more lengthened period.\n\nFrom the town of Tripoli to the Lake Tchad, there are nearly twenty degrees—an extent of land more than twice and a half the length of Great Britain. It is by this route that the convoys of negroes are driven by their pitiless masters, condemned, under the burning sun, to the tortures of thirst, hunger and fatigue. It is a long funeral march in the midst of the solitude of the desert.\n\nFrom time to time one of the miserable company falls, to rise no more; his fellow-prisoners make no halt to cover his body even with a little sand. Let it not be supposed that this is a picture of the imagination only. Monsieur Rohlfs, who was an eyewitness of these things during his explorings between the years 1865 and 1867, and who was the first to denounce these mysteries of crime, gives them to us in frightful detail:—\n\n""On both sides of the road,"" he says, ""we see the blanched bones of the victimised slaves—skeletons still covered by the haikoun, the clothing of the blacks. The traveller who knows nothing of the road to Bourno, has only to follow these scattered remains, and he will not be misguided.""\n\nThe merchants take a singular precaution, lest the slave should rob them of a few drops of water: they place the leathern bottle in such a position, that the orifice is turned towards the head of the camel that carries it. The animal, which is itself athirst, begins to cry as soon as the precious vessel is touched, and thus the attempt to partake of its contents would be discovered. Thus thirst, as well as bodily fatigue, has innumerable victims.\n\n* ""The Slave Trade in Africa in 1872. Principally carried on for the supply of Turkey, Egypt, Persia, and Zanzibar.""

L. Cameron, R.N., C.B. The Earl of Dundonald was in the chair.\n\nCommander Lovett Cameron, in the course of his opening remarks, said the slave trade went on all round the continent of Africa, and commerce had gone on with it. Our trade with the West Coast of Africa had gone on since the time of the Tudors. For centuries that trade was in slaves, and its increase was slow; but after several blows had been struck at that trade—among others by the liberation of slaves in the West Indian Islands, in America, and in Cuba—instead of their being any injury done to our commerce, our trade with the West Coast of Africa increased by leaps and bounds. It was only in 1850 or shortly after that we attacked a great nest of slave dealers in Lagos, and in 1861 it was made a British colony. Up to that time there had been no trade there except in slaves; but last year the trade of Lagos amounted to £357,831 imports, and £538,980 exports. And yet only thirty-eight years ago that place was of absolutely no value to us for legitimate commerce. On the Gold Coast slavery had been practically abolished by the British Government, but yet there was a good deal still existing owing to the native customs of the people. Even if the export of slaves from Africa was prevented entirely, the internal trade in them would still be enormous.\n\nFormerly the slave trade was subsidiary to the ivory trade, but when porters were no longer wanted for the latter, the former remained, only the men were killed and the women and children carried away. It had been said that domestic slavery must be allowed, and that was a very difficult question to settle. In his opinion, we should, as in India, abolish the legal status of slavery, but should not rout out all the households where no complaint was made. As long as domestic slavery existed there would be a market for slaves. We must have nothing to do with slavery; while the slave trade continued it was impossible for legitimate commerce to go on as it should! If the slave trade were done away with, they would find that all other trade would flourish.\n\nIn answer to questions Commander Lovett Cameron said he had avoided speaking of the Germans for diplomatic reasons.\n\nHe had a plan for the total abolition of slavery in Africa, which he hoped to explain shortly. It was, in brief, to establish a barricade across the country by the way of the lakes, and to get authority to maintain order on that line.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, on February 26, presided over a large meeting, held in Exeter Hall, when two African explorers, Commander Cameron and Captain Hore, were announced to speak.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-03-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_03_1889#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SLAVERY AND THE SLAVE-TRADE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""It would be impossible to give more than the barest outline of the efforts of England in Central Africa, unhappily at present so little crowned with success.

Besides the discovery of vast inland seas, and the tracing of great rivers, including some 3,000 miles of navigable water on the Congo, the haunts of the slave-hunters have been revealed, and the deadly trail of the slave caravan has been tracked into the very heart of the continent. There seems little reason to doubt that the estimate that at least 500,000 human lives are annually sacrificed to the slave-trade, is in no way exaggerated, and that up to the present moment but little diminution has taken place in the flow of this fatal stream. There are many routes by which the thousands of slaves annually required for the Egyptian market are taken to that country, and owing to late disorders many of these routes have been changed. The fact has been too much lost sight of that the Mahdi's rebellion was originally a slave-traders' revolt.\n\nThe empire of Morocco, though comparatively close to England, is still disgraced by open slave markets, and the public sales of slaves in the streets of all her chief towns.

It is pleasing to note that a strong abolition movement has lately taken place in Brazil, resulting in the freedom of many thousands of slaves.\n\nLet us now turn to contemplate the ""unhappy hunting-grounds"" of the world—the boundless blood-stained territories of the ""Dark Continent.""\n\nThe whole of the West Coast of Africa is now nominally free from the curse of the slave-trade, though slavery still exists among all the native tribes, and in the Portuguese settlements forced labour is carried on under *indenture*, which is a form little removed from that of actual slavery. Free settlements, such as Liberia, Sierra Leone, &c., have progressed considerably under the influence of commerce and free labour, and this progression would have been much more rapid were it not for the stigma that attaches to labour in all countries where slavery has been a permanent institution. On the East Coast of Africa the great island of Madagascar has cleared itself from the reproach of the slave-trade. The importation of slaves from Africa was put an end to by the late Queen Ranavalonamanjaka II. in the year 1877. With regard to the Portuguese territories in Africa (Mozambique, &c.), it is difficult to speak with precision. The authorities declare that no slave-trade exists, but the evidence of English officials and missionaries in Eastern Africa throws considerable doubt upon that statement. Zanzibar alone of all the Arab powers on the East Coast of Africa has cleared herself from the stigma of the slave-trade. The mission of Sir. Bartle Frere in 1873 paved the way for this movement, which was completed by the recent treaty between England and the Sultan.

The General History of Africa highlights Dahomey's persistent engagement in the slave trade, even as European powers, particularly the British, sought to abolish it, with the kingdom continuing to export slaves to Brazil until 1888. This reliance is further underscored by Dahomey's strategic shift to the palm oil trade in response to changing economic conditions. The textbook also notes Dahomey's use of captives for human sacrifice during annual customs, although it does not explicitly discuss foreign influence as a factor in the kingdom's decline. However, it does mention military confrontations with France and the strategic need to modernize its army. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize Dahomey's notorious dependence on the slave trade and human sacrifice as integral to its societal and economic structure, condemning these practices for decreasing the population and straining relations with neighboring regions. The articles highlight external pressures from British and French interventions aimed at curbing Dahomey's atrocities and protecting their interests in West Africa. They also discuss the strategic limitations on Dahomey's military resources, evident in defeats against more organized European forces, and the influence of foreign powers through blockades and fines. Together, these sources illustrate how Dahomey's internal reliance on destructive practices and external pressures contributed to its decline and threatened its long-term stability and independence.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that align with the claim regarding Dahomey's dependence on the slave trade and its implications for the kingdom's stability and independence.

This reliance on the slave trade is evident in Dahomey's continued export of slaves to Brazil until 1888, despite external pressures to cease such activities. The text also notes Dahomey's adaptation to changing economic conditions by transitioning to palm oil trade, which suggests a strategic shift in response to external pressures. However, the claim about human sacrifice is supported by the mention of Dahomey's use of captives for human sacrifice during annual customs. The text does not explicitly discuss foreign influence as a factor in Dahomey's decline, but it does mention the kingdom's military confrontations with France and the strategic limitations faced by Dahomey, such as the need to modernize its army in response to French aggression.

Additionally, the articles mention external pressures, such as British and French interventions, which were motivated by the desire to curb Dahomey's atrocities and protect their own interests in West Africa. The strategic limitations on Dahomey's military resources are also evident, as the kingdom faced defeats in battles, such as the one against Abeokuta, and struggled against more organized European forces.

The European anti-slave trade movement hit the state's economy, based as it was almost solely on the slave trade. However, Gezo's economic policy was to continue to respond to the demand for slaves from Portuguese dealers while at the same time responding to the stimulus of the export trade in palm oil as the ultimate substitute for slave exports.$^{22}$ These signs of the relative political and economic strength of Dahomey were becoming visible at the same time as symptoms of advanced decline were becoming increasingly apparent in Old Qyo.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

Its adjustment to changing times was noticeable from the mid-century when, under the influence of a French trading firm, Victor RØgis, King Gezo (c. 1818-58) of Dahomey was persuaded to intensify the trade in palm oil, first as a supplement to the export of slaves and eventually as the dominant factor in the state's export economy.$^{41}$ The transition from slave to 'legi› timate' trade meant a corresponding increase in the need to retain war captives as labour for the maintenance and expansion of the palm oil industry. Slaves also came to be used more for transporting goods from the interior to the coast and vice-versa than as commodities for export. By the time of the French conquest of 1892-4, the foundation of Dahomey's new economy - the monoculture of palm produce - had already been laid.

Due to a by no means unusual time-lag, European decisions to abolish the slave trade did not prevent it from reaching a paroxysm in the course of the nineteenth century in a number of countries on the Niger Bend and in the upper basin of the various affluents of the Volta. Emancipation by the state and reintegration into lineage groups did little to reduce the destructive effects of this scourge, which was not to abate until the end of the nineteenth century. In fact, those countries whose economies had been kept going by the 'ports of the desert' at the end of the caravan routes were now enclosed and isolated, being separated from the coast by other states, at a time when basic trading patterns were collapsing.

This was because the cost of weapons increased steadily, so that pro› gressively greater numbers of slaves had to be offered in exchange.

The main sources of supply, however, were not only the great djihäd conducted by the Muslim leaders of the north and the conflicts in Mossi territory. The trade was also fed from a host of channels that sluiced off slaves from peoples belonging to hundreds of chieftaincies, from the territories of the Tuareg to the areas bordering the trading posts on the coast. During the final decades of the nineteenth century, war broke out in virtually every decade and in virtually every region, and war meant captives.

This move constituted a serious blow to the economic interests of Abomey. In 1889, the heir to the throne, Prince Kondo, informed the governor of the RiviŁres de Sud, Bayol, that the Fon people would never accept such a situation. In February 1890, Bayol ordered the occupa› tion of Cotonou and the arrest of all the Fon notables in the town. Prince Kondo, who had begun his reign in December 1889 under the name of Behanzin, reacted by mobilizing his troops. At the time, Abomey had a permanent army which, in peacetime, numbered 4000 men and women. In wartime military service was compulsory for all males, supported by the Amazons, who were dreaded female warriors.\nThe French garrison was attacked at dusk, at the same time as part of the army dispatched to the region of Porto Novo set about destroying the palm trees. According to Behanzin, those economic counter-measures quickly induced the French to sue for peace. On 3 October, Father DorgŁre presented himself in Abomey with proposals for peace. In return for the recognition of Cotonou as a French possession and the right of the French to levy custom duties and station a garrison of troops there, the French were to pay Behanzin an annuity of 20000 francs. The king accepted these terms and the treaty was signed on 3 October 1890. However, to defend the rest of his state, the king started to modernize his army. Between January 1891 and August 1892 he purchased, '1,700 rapid-firing rifles, six Krupp cannon of various bore, five machine-guns, 400,000 assorted cartridges and a large quantity of shell'$^{31}$ from German firms operating in Lome."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'Implications of incorporation', 'content': 'There is no need to exaggerate the role of external forces in African statebuilding.

If the two went hand to hand for Dahomey and Oyo, in Benin we had the formation of a strong state without such participation, and the inverse was true for the Niger delta. 36 The point, however, is a different one. It is that involvement in the world-economy required political structures that ensured the functioning of the economy; its commerce, its production, its labour-force supply.\nThe outside pressure was to have such structures.$^{37}$ Where the existing structures performed the necessary functions, for whatever reason, there was little pressure to change them. But, of course, the involvement in the world-economy increased the economic importance to given internal producers of sympathetic political structures.

As plantation slavery and the slave trade were phenomena deriving from the operation of the capitalist world-economy, so was the abolition of the slave trade and of plantation slavery. I do not wish here to re-open the question of the importance of the abolitionists as a pressure group in this process. They of course existed and were part of the process.

A switch meant changing old trade habits and methods, and dealing with a new set of white traders. Internally too, it was more difficult to process palm oil, and to crack the palm nuts to obtain the kernels than to organize slave supply. For the delta merchants, it meant having to penetrate deeper into the hinterland to the centres of production, and the use of a larger labour force and canoes. It was a situation with the potential for making the old established leaders bankrupt, and encouraging the rise of new enterprising ones.

Presents have been made to him, and offers of friendship have been held out to him, with a real desire on the part of England to benefit Dahomey and Africa. We cannot go on in this ridiculous way. The King must give up the slave-trade, or he must prepare to see his ports blockaded, which must very soon have the desired effect, because all those things which are absolutely necessary to him now will be prevented from reaching the shore. He cannot live or feed his people without those things. He will not be able to sell his slaves, because they cannot be shipped. His wars with Abeokuta and others are consuming the strength of his kingdom, because many are killed, many made prisoners, many die—and who can replace them. If I stop his supplies, how can he exist? There is no cultivation and no produce of the soil. He and his people will starve, and his kingdom will be broken up. Tell him that all the kings and tribes round Dahomey are his enemies, and that if once the English blockade his coast they will be glad of the opportunity to rise against him and destroy him. Perhaps Abeokuta will do this. Who can say? Be sure you tell the King truly all that I have said, and that the advice of his best friend is that he should at once send his principal chiefs to Whydah, and make the treaty with me that the Queen of England requires.""\n\nOur correspondent says that the messenger acknowledged that all the Commodore had said was true—and there can be no doubt that he will faithfully report every word of it to the King.

We do not mean that they would proceed to greater extremities in their horrible excesses and barbarous despotism than in the past; but that the time would come when the civilized countries of Europe, and Great Britain in especial, would rouse themselves from their inertia as regards Dahoman atrocities and outrages, and take some effective steps for curbing that savage will in which they have originated. The late visit of the British squadron under Commodore Sir William Hewett to the waters of Whydah, his inquiry into reported outrages committed at that place by the local authorities of the King of Dahomey upon the persons of certain British and French subjects employed in mercantile affairs there, and his imposition of a fine of 500 puncheons of oil, equivalent to the sum of £6,000, to be enforced by blockade if not paid before the end of June next, may be regarded as the first letters of “the handwriting on the wall” foretelling the destruction of a system the devilish action of which, both externally and internally, is at the present time a standing insult to humanity. It is the more significant of “the handwriting on the wall” by a supreme Divine Power, that this first step in the right direction by Great Britain as regards Dahomey should have been made, and most righteously made, by a British naval officer, after consultation with the Governor-in-Chief of the Gold Coast Colony, without any previous communication with, or any direct instructions from, Her Majesty’s Government, at the very time when the Government of France, acting under the malefic influence and representations of the old Marseilles slave-trade interests, should have made difficulties about the acquisition of Gambia, which it has so long and so mightily desired, because it was called upon, as one of the conditions, to relinquish any supposed claims it might have upon a worthless old fort at Whydah, formerly used by French slave-dealers as a slave depôt, and since as mercantile stores. It is, of course, only a logical sequence to what has been done at other parts of the West Coast of Africa, the so-called oil rivers and elsewhere, that the commander of a British squadron should thus inquire into outrages and injuries inflicted by native authorities on British merchants and their employés, impose and levy fines, and stop the trade of the place until those fines were paid. But the present is the first occasion on which this wholesome discipline has been brought to bear upon his Majesty of Dahomey, and we hope from it some very salutary results. Up to the time of our writing there has not been any intelligence received as to the emotions and intentions of the King that may have found expression in words or deeds when he heard of this fine of 500 puncheons of oil, and a blockade if it be not paid at a certain time. He was absent from his capital, engaged with his forces in their annual raid in the Egba countries, mention of which is made in our Abeokuta and Lagos news,—raids which ought not any longer to be permitted by Great Britain, as the interests of her settlement at Lagos are grievously injured thereby,—raids that may be effectually prevented by the cutting off from the King of Dahomey of those supplies of ammunition and other warlike stores which he receives through Whydah. But we fully expect to hear that one of his Majesty’s earliest commands has been the sacrifice of those Whydah authorities who committed the outrages complained of (and inquired into by Sir William Hewett) in their endeavours to satisfy the royal greed, which, as is well known to those acquainted with affairs on the West Coast of Africa, is insatiate, and ever looking to Whydah for renewed supplies. Next, we expect he will offer apologies, and point to his victims, the sacrificed and murdered authorities, as proof that all such deeds had been opposed to his principles, orders, and desires. But this will not do. Not one penny or one gallon of oil of the fine imposed by Sir William Hewett ought to be or can be remitted.

They were as distinct as the Accras and the Fantees, and their policy was to keep Dahomey from all communication with the natives of the Coast and with Europeans. There are several towns inland on the road to Dahomey which were part of Whydah. At one, Savvee, the next town to Whydah, and only an hour or two distant, the ""forts""—i.e., the slave factories—originally were, and at that time it is said the town extended from Savvee to the beach. The story of the conquest of Whydah by Dahomey is something amusing. It is said that the Whydahs kept the Dahomans as much in the dark as possible. In selling them guns they took off the cock and the cover of the pan, and made them believe it was fired with a brand (in the manner of cannon of those days), so that two men were required to each gun. It happened, however, one fine day, that a Dahoman chanced to purchase a musket at Little Popo (native name, Grijee), and got it complete, and so the Whydah trick was detected. Dahomey made this a cause of war. It can scarcely be credited (only it is impossible to limit the folly of man), but the tradition is, that at that time the great fetish at Whydah was a very fat bull, and at a piece of water (a swamp, I believe) which the Dahomans would have to cross, they placed this bull, and quietly and trustingly went on with their usual life, without considering it at all necessary that they should do anything themselves towards their defence; everything was to be left to the fetish. When the Dahoman army arrived at this place they were for a long time held in check, thinking the absence of all opposition was some deep-laid and very cunning ambush; but at last an inferior captain, with a mere handful of men, determined to cross at all risks and unmask this piece of strategy, and as he found there really was no opposition, he dashed forward, leaving the Dahoman force to follow. The Whydahs appear to have been so perfectly surprised, so utterly hopeless of opposing an enemy their great fetish could not stop, that they absolutely made no resistance, but were shot down, knocked on the head, and captured like poultry. The Whydahs are said to have been at that time very populous, but now it is probable they are totally extinct.

Of the ultimate result of the French expedition, if undertaken with a due regard to the exceptional character of the warfare to be waged, there can be no real doubt: but if at the outset the French were to suffer a reverse, its effect upon the Dahomeyans can only be to enormously increase the difficulties in the way of a satisfactory settlement.

If the new King persists in remaining in the interior with his prisoners, and refuses to treat for their release, it is clear that the French Government will be forced to take serious measures to protect the lives of its subjects. M. Etienne\'s speech in the Chamber of Deputies recently was a model of what a Ministerial explanation under such circumstances ought to be. This is not a case of more or less imaginary Kroumirs or Black Flags, whose depredations afford an excuse for an act of aggression and conquest. The King has repeatedly attacked the French stations on the coast, and although his forces have been repulsed, he declares he will not rest till he has driven the strangers out. Moreover, a French missionary and five civilians have been seized at Whydah and carried up the country, where, if not rescued, a horrible fate awaits them. All this points in only one direction, and Europeans may at any time hear that the kingdom of Dahomey is condemned to disappear as an independent State. That the Ffons can hope seriously to resist a French force is out of the question. Imbued though they are with savage ferocity, the Dahomeyans are no match for disciplined troops and machine guns. Indeed, of late it is affirmed that the reputation of the people for brute courage is no longer so well deserved as of old. But they are bloodthirsty and vindictive, and reckless of their lives when roused. They may give the French a great deal of trouble, and as women form the backbone of the Dahomeyan Army, it must be an unusually repulsive duty for the ""Grande Nation"" to enter into hostilities with them. Its Amazonian warriors and the bloody ""customs"" are the two characteristics of Dahomey which have kept it so prominently before the eye of civilisation. The country itself is of little value. Abomey, the capital, is situated about sixty-five miles from the coast. Whydah, the only seaport of any consequence, is the part of the kingdom with which Europeans are best acquainted. Here there are trading forts and ""factories"" belonging to the English, French, Portuguese, and Brazilians, which were places of importance during the days of the slave trade. Then the barracoons were crammed with human chattels, while the King was hunting down the neighbouring tribes in order to keep up the supply of that ""black ivory"" from which he derived such ample wealth. When this traffic came to an end, Whydah sank into insignificance, and is now simply a place of some 12,000 inhabitants, from which palm oil is shipped when the surf permits communications between vessel and shore.

Those expectations were formed on the supposition that he might possess some few grains of common sense, which would place vividly before his mental vision the dangers of collision between an earthen pot and a sledge hammer wielded by an arm of power. It seems to be now past dispute that, instead of disowning the acts of the brutal authorities at Whydah, who showed themselves to be fit servants to such a master, he has put a bold front on the matter, and sent the insolent message that ""he will pay the Commodore in powder and bullets if he will come up to Abomey."" This is the language that might be expected only from a doomed idiot, vapouring among the spiritless slaves by whom he may be surrounded, and who have worshipped him as almost a god, until he believes himself to be quite one. It is clearly full time that both King and people should be undeceived by coming in rude contact with something more than a few European trading clerks and agents, who, naturally enough, in the interests of their trade, submit, uncomplainingly, to everything short of actual plunder and brutal violence. Our opinions and feelings respecting the frantic iniquity of Dahomey are so strong, and our conviction that it is the imperative duty of Great Britain, as the real protecting Power on the West Coast of Africa, to put a final end to its enormities as being a daily insult to humanity, is so unalterable, that all we can say in reply to the braggart King is that we hope he will continue in his present frame of mind, and not be moved to feigned repentance by the blockade of his sea-ports. We do not wish him to repent, and thus save himself and his authority from destruction—unless his repentance should go so far (which it never would do) as to secure his faithful acquiescence in British demands, that he should never henceforth make any inroads into Egba territories in search of victims for his atrocious festivals, and that those festivals of blood should be entirely put an end to. The earth has groaned long enough under this blood-thirsty monster, and the devilish system that he at this time represents. That system is incurable by any other means than the entire destruction of the Power with which it is identified, and of which it is an inseparable part. The late King, and the present also, more than once declared to Europeans who have been on missions to Abomey, that even were he desirous of doing so, he could not discontinue that perpetual series of human sacrifices in which his people delight; that his prestige would be gone, and that he in his turn would be a victim if he ceased to justify by deeds his title of ""Man-slayer."" There is possibly truth in this. The people, like their King, are accustomed to sniff the, to them, intoxicating odour of the reeking blood of victims slaughtered before their eyes, and would object to be deprived of a gratification they have so long enjoyed. Under such circumstances there is only one way of purifying the horribly polluted atmosphere of Dahomey, and that is by bringing a superior force to bear upon King, people, and institutions. As already stated, we have ourselves always held the opinion that it was the duty of a civilized Christian Power such as Great Britain to interfere in the interests of humanity. There are now other interests, in addition to those of mere humanity, urging and impelling to the work. Not only has one of her subjects been grievously maltreated, but the financial interests of the Gold Coast Colony are very prejudicially interfered with by the action of Dahomey as a marauding State. The yearly armed expeditions into the Egba territories, even up to the immediate neighbourhood of Abeokuta, in quest of plunder and victims for sacrifice in the ""Customs,"" inflict very great injury not only on the industrious Egba agriculturists, but also, as a necessary result, on the revenues of Lagos. There is an annual scare in the Egba territories. Farms are deserted, the people take refuge in Abeokuta, and their property is wasted and destroyed. We feel sure that we do not exaggerate when we say that were those marauding inroads to cease, and to cease at the absurd certainty that there will not be any renewal of them, agricultural industry will take so great a development in the Egba countries that the production would be doubled, with corresponding advantage to the', 'last_edit_date': '1876-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1876#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'How to Treat Dahomey', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""We observe by our English journals, received per Ethiope, that the friends of Africa in England are greatly bestirring themselves in favour of our country.

Some anti-slavery journals appear to deprecate the use of force towards that monarch. They think that persuasion and entreaty should be brought to bear on him, with a view to induce him to desist from his practices of sacrificing human beings and engaging in slave-hunts. Persuasion, argument, and entreaty, have been repeatedly used on this present King of Dahomey and his predecessors, and used in vain. These kings tell us that it is the custom of their nation to hunt for slaves and to sacrifice human beings. He who is king is obliged to do these things. It is with him just as much a duty as the abiding by the advice of responsible ministers is with the Sovereign of Great Britain. If he abstained from these practices, his subjects would turn him out, and set up another man in his place, who would carry them out in accordance with immemorial usage.

All this is changed by the Treaty. British subjects have now a recognized station; they may visit, reside, and trade in Dahomey as of right; they are not to be annoyed, or inconvenienced, or impeded in their trade, either by the King of Dahomey, his subjects, or any foreigners within his dominions; and they may hire, occupy, and possess any houses or warehouses for the purposes of commerce. We do not underrate, nor do we think those engaged, or to be hereafter engaged, in commerce and trade with and in Dahomey will underrate the importance of these stipulations. We should have been glad, however, to see an additional one, which is unhappily absent, to the effect that no British subject, or his goods or produce, should be liable to any additional or increased payment or exaction over and above what may be demanded and taken from the subjects of any other foreign Power. The position and influence in Dahomey of the subjects of one other European Power—a position and influence dating from the time of the foreign slavetrade—rendered, we think, a ""most favoured nation"" clause as desirable in this treaty with Dahomey as in other treaties in which it has been from time to time inserted. The confirmation of pre-existing stipulations as regards the foreign slave-trade, was a matter of course. No British negotiations treating with such a State as Dahomey could possibly fail to reassert the determined opposition of Her Majesty\'s Government to any renewal of that odious traffic in human flesh, now, happily, almost extinct, so far as the West Coast of Africa is concerned; although during the last twelve months, and, unhappily, even in our last and this present number, we have had to expose desultory individual efforts, on the part, too, of British subjects, to revive and perpetuate it. But our most hearty thanks are due to Her Majesty\'s Government and to Commodore Sullivan for the stipulation in Article 6. Although unable, at present, to force the discontinuance of human sacrifices in Dahomey, it was well to place on record anew the British abhorrence of them, by demanding and obtaining for British subjects an exemption from those horrible commands which the King of Dahomey has been accustomed to make and enforce on Europeans at Whydah, that they should attend his abominable Customs, in which so many poor creatures are tortured and sacrificed, at the behests of a bloodthirsty superstition. Article 6 stipulates that ""no British subject shall henceforth be compelled to attend any of the Customs of the country of Dahomey where any human sacrifices are held."" This stipulation alone, even if the Treaty had not contained those other important ones on which we have commented, would have amply justified the remission of a portion of the fine imposed by Sir William Hewett, and to enforce payment of which the Dahoman coast was blockaded. Such a stipulation is cheap at 100 puncheons of oil; and we are quite sure Her Majesty\'s Government would have abandoned all claim to the other 400 puncheons, and even made an annual payment out of the Imperial Exchequer in addition, if King Gélélé would have undertaken, in consideration thereof, to abolish those human sacrifices which cause every humane mind to think of Dahomey with disgust and loathing.

Of all desire for such enterprises Tonquin has cured them for a long time. They know too well the hardships and sufferings that are implied to echo the warlike wishes of the country. They know too well how many suffer and are worn out without recompense, how many have to struggle in obscurity after the conquest seems at an end, to encourage France with a light heart to enter upon enterprises of this kind so long as a really patriotic interest is not at stake. Henri Rivière was actuated by a personal ambition which urged him to adventures in Tonquin. This strange country, which it was thought could be conquered with fifty men, and which has not been subdued with 50,000, was more attractive than the miserable and deadly Dahomey. No; it is not the soldiers, not the seafaring forces, who favour an attack on Dahomey. You will be surprised when I tell you that it is the commercial houses established on the coast who desire to involve France in this enterprise, and who employ the most extraordinary means to accomplish their ends. It is not the first time that such things have happened. We have seen them in Senegambia and elsewhere at work in the same way. It is sometimes missionaries, sometimes employés on the coast, who have lost their way as if by accident in the interior, and who almost provoke their capture, who enable the trading houses to make a great noise and to call for the intervention of the mother country, and who involve it in a war of conquest. They do so because by this means their fortunes are increased a hundredfold, for a factory worth 10,000f. on a coast under savage rule is worth 1,000,000f. on one which has become French.\n\nNow, on the coast of Dahomey the most important business house is at the same time the one most skilful in pushing its interests by the most varied means. The firm is now Monte & Fabre, but in reality it is simply the old house of Régis, the first settled on the coast. Curious stories are told of its early doings. It is said that it began by collecting shells which the King of Dahomey used as money. Goods were purchased with them, about which statements are made which it would now be difficult to verify. In our time the shells are no longer used as coin, and the merchandise is one of a kind now difficult to remove. Accordingly the old house of Régis, young again in its successors, would not object to a change enabling it to carry on business not on Dahomian but on French territory, or on territory protected by France.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1890#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British Operations in the Gambia', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At length, however, it would seem that matters have reached a crisis; and the French Government has awoke to the fact that the suppression of Dahomey as an independent nation is absolutely essential if they would retain their protectorates on the West Coast.\n\nTwo thousand armed Dahomeyans crossed the Quetowe on the 29th ult. and encamped at Oboa, on the left bank of the Oueme. The King collected his warriors at Allada and another band at Kezenon.

King Behanzin agreed, and fulfilled his agreement by sending in two obscure natives, two cannon, 100 rifles, and 5,000 francs. Thereupon General Dodds began to march upon the capital, but Behanzin reduced the place to ashes before the French troops could get there. All they could find in the way of spoil was some cheap muslins and bad spirits, which were at once destroyed. After this the troops were withdrawn with the exception of a small garrison. General Dodds considers that the capture of Behanzin is only a matter of time, as he will be driven in by the pressure of want.\n\nThe latest news from Porto Novo says the French are preparing another expedition to march against King Behanzin and the contemplated return to the coast in August next of General Dodds tends to confirm this intelligence. The despatch says it is stated that in a recent engagement an officer of the rank of commandant was killed, together with a captain and three subalterns. From Dahomey we have reported the occupation of Abomey, the capital, by the French. Several conflicts have taken place between the French troops and the Dahomeyans, in which the latter were using chiefly poisoned arrows. The new expedition is to start in September, and before the despatch was sent off Senegambian troops were reported to have been landed at Kotonou and Whydah. Numbers of the natives of Porto Novo were being pressed into the service as carriers for the French and taken on to Whydah.\n\nIt is understood that General Dodds will sail from Marseilles on August 10 on his return to Dahomey. There is almost a unanimity of opinion in France that if the public had imagined a tithe of what Dahomey will have cost before it is finally reduced the expedition would never have taken place. Dahomey has proved a thoroughly bad speculation, and nobody is in a position to tell how much longer this drain on the French Budget is likely to last.

The French nation has not shown much interest in this war: which has not even provoked enough criticism to be made a weapon of party controversy.

The little cloud of Herzegovinian insurrection which rose suddenly last year on the Eastern horizon has spread until there is now active hostility between Turkey and Servia and Montenegro; while there are strong indications that its dark folds will soon also envelope Roumania. In a word, the area of conflict is extending in those countries, and it is by no means impossible that Turkey will soon have really to fight its ""battle of life"" against its revolted dependencies, which are seemingly determined, if possible, to cast off entirely the rule and suzerainté of the great Mohammedan empire. Notwithstanding the deep interest which we naturally feel in this spreading war darkness and its possible results, our thoughts are not the less turned toward that barbarous State in West Africa which, according to the latest news, seems to be determined, in its heathen ignorance and insolence, to oppose its puny might to the strength of Great Britain. To the English mind nothing can, of course, appear more ridiculous than war between Great Britain and Dahomey. It could only be a collision between an earthen and an iron pot, with the one inevitable result; for we presume that if the monster of Dahomey should really make it necessary for Great Britain to send an expedition into his country, there will not be a repetition in his case of the grievous error that has been committed in Ashanti—error which has doubtless not been without its influence at Abomey. A few hours\' occupation of that blood-stained place, and the destruction of one or more of the extensive royal huts which are dignified with the name of ""palaces,"" would not by any means respond to the necessities of the situation. Habitually watching events in Western Africa as under the guidance of Divine Providence, we thought that we foresaw in the very act of the formation of the Gold Coast Colony (following after the Ashanti expedition) the beginning of the end of Dahomey as a State in West Africa. Our readers will perhaps remember that we expressed this belief very strongly at the time. It was from our point of view clearly impossible, the Gold Coast and Lagos being united in one Gold Coast Colony, that the little semi-Dahoman villages between Quittah and Whydah, with this latter and Godomey, could continue for any length of time under other rule and control than that of the Governor of the Gold Coast Colony, acting for and in the name of Queen Victoria. We did not, of course, see in advance what event was to bring up the ""little cloud"" on the Dahoman horizon. But little clouds are constantly arising in West African horizons, and the ignorant pride and cupidity of Dahoman rulers might well be trusted to raise such a one as that which necessitated the visit of Commodore Sir William Hewett to Whydah, and the infliction by him of a fine on the King and State of Dahomey. The King\'s insolent refusal to pay this fine had made it imperative to blockade Whydah and the neighbouring sea-coast villages or towns east and west of that place; and such blockade commenced, we doubt not, as appointed by Her Majesty\'s Government, on the 1st of July. The question now naturally arises whether the payment of the fine originally inflicted ought to free the King of Dahomey, since he has imposed on Great Britain the trouble and expense of sending a fleet of ships of war to enforce it. We think not. Independently of our anxious desire to see Dahomey extinguished as an independent State, we feel that the petty barbarians along the West Coast ought to have full conviction brought home to them by a signal example that the majesty of Great Britain is not to be insulted and defied with impunity. It is for the benefit of Benin, Brass, Bonny, Opobo, Old and New Calabar, and Cameroons, that this conviction should become fully impressed on the minds of the people and rulers of those places. They ought to be made thoroughly to understand by one great example that whenever their misdeeds render it necessary to impose a fine on them, that fine must be paid without the necessity being created of the presence of a squadron to enforce and receive payment. As regards precedent for this, we need not be in any doubt. Since Germany exacted five thousand millions of francs from France for the trouble and expense of beating her armies, forcing an entrance into her capital, and stripping her of Alsace and Lorraine, we have a precedent for all time, ample to cover every demand that irresistible power may make and enforce. Dahomey has given Great Britain occasion to exercise control over her affairs. She has continuously injured the British Settlement at Lagos by her annual inroads into the Egba territory in quest of plunder, slaves, and victims, to be slaughtered in the ""Customs"" at Abomey. British remonstrance has been useless—received with little less than contempt. Those slave-hunting raids and fearful butcheries, at the behest of a sanguinary superstition, are said to be absolutely necessary to the continued existence of the Dahoman kingdom. No stronger evidence can surely be required of the absolute necessity of destroying such a kingdom. Our readers will find in another column the account given by an escaped Liberian, named ""Tubman,"" who was captured by the Dahomans under the walls of Abeokuta during one of those annual incursions. The narrative is full of food for thought at this time, and we think it will be read with deep interest. Since that was in type we have received a second edition of it from another and very able native correspondent. In this account he says: ""The 800 captives taken with Tubman were men, women, children, and infants, kidnapped and otherwise taken in the Egba farms. When they arrived at Abomey, which they reached in six days (there was much halting on the way), they were taken to the high priest of the national gods. It was for him to decide who were to be sacrificed, and who to be spared. He divined by means of water and kola nuts. In this way 150 of Tubman\'s fellow-captives were selected for a grand sacrifice which was offered in December last. Tubman was assigned to a priest of ""Shango,"" the God of Thunder, to be one of his attendants. Shango priests are held in much superstitious dread, the King greatly supporting them. It is customary to administer to all captives who are not to be sacrificed, but distributed between the King, his warriors, priests, and others, a ""Lethe,"" so that they may forget home and its associations, and have no inclination to escape. This ""Lethe"" consists of boiling spirits mixed with the blood of a slave, flowing fresh from his throat, which is cut while his head is held over the steaming spirits, which have also some vegetable powders mixed with them. The slave whose blood is to be thus drank by his companions is always thus killed in their presence. A good quantity of this preparation is administered to each. None dare refuse it. Tubman had to drink about half a pint of this vile and abominable preparation."" This is the Dahomey with which Great Britain is now brought into collision—a land drunk with the blood of victims, shed to gratify the brutal passions of the dominant section of its people, and the inordinate thirst of its so-called gods. Let it be remembered that these cruel butcheries and vile abominations are continual, from day to day and year to year. Are we not, then, justified in saying that, having now a pretext for interference with a kingdom which thus stains the earth, and which greatly injures our neighbouring possessions, it is our duty, as evidently charged with the propaganda of civilization and the vindication of the rights of humanity on the West Coast, to extend our arm in the small degree necessary to put an end at once and for ever to one of the most monstrous systems that ever encumbered and insulted this earth?

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa.

In such circumstances they were bound, slowly but inexorably, to fall into decline.\nIn these circumstances, as often happens in periods of crisis, social divisions were exacerbated, transforming the relatively egalitarian struc› tures that had been characteristic of the societies of the Sahel during their period of ascendancy. Another factor was the evolution of the religious movements which, after the tolerance towards traditional cults shown during the preceding centuries, had adopted a more intransigent attitude as a result of the djihad, which had triumphed in Liptako and had swept through the Bambara states. Even the YarsØ of the Mossi country, pre› viously so flexible in both religious and political affairs, began to take up much more rigid positions and engaged in proselytism. However, the Islamic successor states were themselves ephemeral, for they were victims of the same objective conditions that had already doomed the autonomous development of the African states."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'The process of suppression', 'content': ""The reaction to these subterfuges was an increase in violence.

In practice, the consuls, especially after 1850, continued and stepped up a policy started in the 1830s by Edward Nicolls, Governor of Fernando Po, of signing treaties with the local chiefs.$^{6}$ These treaties stipulated the stoppage of the slave trade by the rulers; the adoption of 'legitimate trade', that is, trade in goods other than slaves; laid down regulations for the conduct of legitimate trade; specified the sums of customs duties or comey to be paid by the traders, as well as subsidies that the British government was to pay the local rulers for their agreement to give up the slave trade.\nThese British activities on the coast gradually eroded the power of the local rulers, especially when the consuls and naval officers assisted the British traders to set up their own judicial systems over and above the law of the local states, the so-called Courts of Equity, composed mainly of British traders with the participation of a few local House Heads or chiefs.

Encouraged by Porto Novo itself, a French protectorate was declared over this coastal Aja state in 1863 to check further British advance along the coast to the west. Both the British and the French soon discovered the obvious: that the real value of Lagos or Porto Novo was to be measured in terms of the trade with the hinterland in the Yoruba and Aja interior which the two ports shared. This involvement of both Britain and France in the trade and politics of Lagos and Porto Novo respectively sparked off a spell of dramatic rivalry between the two powers in a bid to control Yorubaland, especially the western parts, and the adjacent Aja-speaking communities. In this Anglo-French rivalry, western Yorubaland became the main theatre because of the positive response of the local peoples, who saw in the European interventions the solution to the problem of the continuous invasion of their area by their more powerful neighbours.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.614, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'Protecting new trade', 'content': ""The coast had always exported palm oil, but in minute quantities.

France imported an average of 4000 tonnes a year between 1847 and 1856 and 2000 tons in the following decade. She compensated by importing an average of 8000 tonnes of groundnuts a year from Senegal and the Gambia plus 25 000 tonnes of 'tulucoona' nuts for the manufacture of household soap; these imports were worth 35 million gold francs in 1870. Something that had long been an abstract Utopian ideal - an alternative to the slave trade, a substitute for trade in men - had at last materialized. It remained to develop production on an industrial scale; and this took no longer than it had taken the Cuban and Brazilian plantations to reach full production of sugar and coffee. The main producing areas corresponded to the best slave-exporting areas, from Dahomey$^{44}$ to the rivers of the Niger delta and Cameroon. One of the essential features of the changeover was that manpower was mobilized on land that had been internally colonized. This admittedly meant that production was by means of a form of slavery, but within an African social and economic context. In fact the energetic development of this economic novelty did not immediately disrupt the traditional economy: slave trade and oil trade co-existed side by side. A more extensive system of barter began to radiate into the interior. On the coast the same agents for the Western trade still kept their grip on the market: they understood purchasing, gave credit, circulated traditional currencies, and introduced metal coinage. The increase in the number of people competing for trade upset the internal balance and led to a realign› ment of forces.$^{4S}$ These economic changes were accelerated by religious and cultural factors causing distortions, which were never very far removed from politics, which helped, however, to put an end to the trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Increased European pressures', 'content': ""Another group of White Fathers left Tabora and went westwards to set up a mission station at Ujiji in 1879 and from there to Rumonge in Burundi, some 120km south of the present Bujumbura, but the station was abandoned in 1881 after the massacre of three missionaries there.

Even where there existed commercial activities, they were offshoots of missionary work. Two such examples existed. The first was the Livingstonia Central African Trading Company, which was associated with Scottish missionary activities in the Lake Nyasa region. Its aim was said to be that of supplying the mission station at Blantyre with necessities through running steamships in the waterways of the region and also that of bringing ivory for commerce at a price that would undercut the Arab merchants using slave labour for porterage.

But when it became clear that such operations no longer benefited French ports either financially or socially, the government signed a reciprocal search agreement.

Hence the slave trade seemed to be less immediately useful for the production of sugar and other plantation crops in British zones while being counter-indicated if one wished to encourage cash-crop production in western Africa.

Given the fact that 'the bigger financiers clearly had a foot in both camps' (ibid., p. 86), the resulting Parliamentary decisions might be seen as a compromise: the West Indian lobby lost on abolition but won on the East Indian tariff.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press.

This is abundantly proved by the fact that people who used to trade in palm-oil and slaves have given up the former to invest their capital in slave traffic alone, it paying them so much better. The consequence is that the state of the country becomes more and more unsafe every day; man-stealing and panyarring; seizing people; and keeping them as pledges for debts and supposed claims; selling them if the debt is not paid, or the claim not satisfied, being encouraged thereby, and legitimate commerce hindered, not to mention the demoralizing influence which slave-trade is exercising on the minds of the natives. According to reports from some parts of the interior, an increased inclination for panyarring has made itself observable, which is no doubt a consequence of the slave-trade, as people have a better market for their slaves now than they had formerly.\n\nAccording to a letter which I received from the Colonial Government, of which you find a copy enclosed (inserted at foot), *it declares itself to be powerless to put a stop to this abominable traffic, although carried on with impunity on British territory, and close to the seat of Government.*\n\nIt appears to me it might be done with no great expense, by reoccupying the forts of Addah and Quittah, or one of them: Addah, at the mouth of the Volta, is growing more important every day; and a considerable trade is carried on there. An able officer stationed at one of these places might be able to put a stop to the slave-trade—which is going on especially on the river, and from Addah down the coast—if a sufficient force was put under his command. The expenses of the garrison would be greatly diminished by the duties to be paid by the merchants.\n\nYou will observe by these informations what our situation is in this country, and how unprotected we are. Civilisation and Christianity can never go hand-in-hand with slave-trade; and as long as the latter is going on unchecked we must see our efforts brought to nought.\n\nThat Her Majesty's cruisers will be able to prevent the slave-trade carried on at the places mentioned, as is suggested by his Excellency, is not at all probable. The slaves are not shipped here, but sent down the coast to Porto Leguro, &c., where the men-of-war can only partially stop it.""}, {'id': 28, 'article_title': 'Quittah', 'full_section_title': 'Quittah', 'last_edit_date': '10-02-1862', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_11_1862#article-7', 'issue_date': '22_11_1862', 'content': ""As Quittah Fort was abandoned (as far as I know) merely for the sake of diminishing the expenditure of this colony by a few hundred pounds, it seems as if this consideration outweighed all other reasons for occupying a station of very great importance for the suppression of a trade that is the ruin of Africa.—I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\n**CHR.

For the sake of a few paltry hundreds a-year, this country, which is spending half-a-million annually on the naval squadron for suppressing the slave-trade, delivers over the people of an extensive region to this monster enormity. We called attention, some twelve months ago, to the active operations of the slavetraders at Quittah, since the virtual abandonment of that place by the British authorities.

The proper re-occupation of Addah and Quittah would destroy the slave-trade up the Volta, and limit it on the coast to the Dahoman territory, until by negotiation, or other means, we can effect its discontinuance there, and thus purge the whole Bight of Benin of this accursed atrocity.'}, {'id': 154, 'article_title': 'THE ACTION OF THE AFRICAN-AID SOCIETY.', 'full_section_title': 'THE ACTION OF THE AFRICAN-AID SOCIETY.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-9', 'issue_date': '23_05_1863', 'content': 'And what has been its action?

The value of the military reports which have been transmitted to the Secretary of State for the Colonies may be truly estimated by the fact that the latest Military Commissioner to the Gold Coast, preceding Colonel Ord, coolly and dogmatically urges that the settlements shall be abandoned! If ever an error could be committed by England towards Africa, that error would be consummated in the complete abandonment of the settlements on the Gold Coast. The Protectorate set up on that Coast is the brightest spot in the whole dark history of England in respect of the African; for in the motive for the establishment of the Protectorate was involved a resolution, fairly and successfully directed, to suppress the slave-trade, and a resolution contritely adopted to render a meed of tardy justice to a race which she had grossly wronged since the hour when, in 1580, Sir John Hawkins began to transfer the slave from his home in Africa to the mahogany forests in Jamaica. Within a twelvemonth after the Union Jack had been hauled down from the flagstaff upon the batteries of Cape Coast Castle, the slave-trade would be rampant along the entire sea-line whence the diabolical traffic has been absolutely driven. This assertion can be proved by simple reference to an event of most recent standing. A certain Governor of the Gold Coast took it into his administrative head to recommend to the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the small batch of troops quartered in the little fort at Quittah should be withdrawn, and that the fort itself should be quietly put beyond the pale of English jurisdiction. Relying on the good sense and judgment of his lieutenant, as in a measure he must rely, the Secretary of State assented. What was the issue? Why, that Quittah was instantly converted—and is still being converted, I believe, notwithstanding all your earnest, praiseworthy efforts to procure its reoccupation—into a pleasant resort for the most unscrupulous members of the slave-dealing family.""}, {'id': 646, 'article_title': ""Colonel Ord's Report"", 'full_section_title': ""Colonel Ord's Report"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_07_1865#article-6', 'issue_date': '22_07_1865', 'content': 'You must not forget that these troubles I have been writing of *are really owing to the abandonment of the Quittah Fort.* Had this fort been retained or re-occupied, as you have so often urged, there would have been none of this war of the Addahs.—Yours,'}, {'id': 2787, 'article_title': 'The New Gold Coast Government at Jellah Coffee and Quitta', 'full_section_title': 'The New Gold Coast Government at Jellah Coffee and Quitta', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_09_1874#article-20', 'issue_date': '30_09_1874', 'content': ""It is not necessary we should remind our readers that we have for a long time advocated an extension of Gold Coast jurisdiction to the eastern side of the River Volta, throughout those territories formerly ceded to the British Government by that of Denmark. There were many reasons, and very serious ones, why this was imperatively called for. Because the Fort at Quitta got into grievous disrepair some ten years ago, the small detachment of West India troops until that time stationed there was withdrawn. The natives then fell gradually under the influence of Ashanti, with whom they formed alliance; and to whom they were of essential use in the supply of arms and munitions of war, as well as of many useful articles. We dare not say much about the slave sales of boys and girls which they also made there, seeing that similar atrocities were permitted at Cape Coast, where the British Government had its chief seat of authority. Having an immunity from the import duties which were levied at all the ports on the western side of the Volta by the British authorities, these trans-Volta districts enjoyed advantages in trade, which led to the settlement of not a few traders there. The accounts which reached us from time to time were of a very unsatisfactory nature; strongly elucidating that, however satisfactory these trading operations in native territory might be to men or firms who made themselves powerful, and could sufficiently bribe the native kings and chiefs, they were far from being so to the weaker traders, who, when wronged (and this was of but too frequent occurrence), were entirely at their mercy, and almost hopeless of obtaining redress. It was with the utmost satisfaction, therefore, that we learned of the extension of British authority, occupation, and rule to these districts, as recognized integral portions of the new Gold Coast Colony. It would have been unfair to the countries west of the Volta, that they should be subject to heavy import duties on certain articles, while their neighbours on the east side of that river, and trading with the same people in the interior, were free from such duties. We naturally expected that the imposition of duties at Jellah Coffee, Quitta, &c., would at first cause some dissatisfaction; but we believed this would be but transient, and that counterbalancing advantages derived from the presence of British authority, if that authority were judiciously exercised, would soon reconcile all the hitherto oppressed and wronged; whatever it might do with the oppressors and wrongdoers, who would naturally dislike the curb thus placed in their mouths, to restrain them in the indulgence of their unjust greediness. The first account we have received of proceedings in the Court of the British Civil Commandant, fully justifies the expectations we entertained. We do not know anything of the parties concerned, or of the merits of the dispute between them. All we can see is, that the one who had been placed in log by native authority, has had judgment in his favour by the British Commandant after a patient hearing; and that the decision was received with joy by the natives, who felt grateful to the Queen for having sent her authority among them. It is not difficult to understand this. The native courts everywhere are well understood to be subservient to those who can pay best, as against those who cannot afford to pay. The weak find little or no protection in them; and the change from this to the decision in a British court, in cases where there cannot, by any possibility, be a suspicion or charge of undue partiality on the part of the magistrate or judge, must commend itself to the public sentiment. We feel that there must be a great arrear of unredressed wrong, of postponed justice, in these trans-Volta seaports; and we expect to hear of many other cases not essentially differing from that of Bruce v. Williams. There are not any powerful English firms there, whose influence might be supposed, as sometimes at Cape Coast and Lagos, to warp and bias the mind of the presiding judicial authority; and we have, therefore, every reason to expect decisions in disputed cases, which will give general satisfaction; together with a feeling of security on the part of the weaker members of the community, which will be well worth the payment of regulated Customs' duties, and be, indeed, thus very cheaply purchased. All that will be wanting there, as in the older settlements, will be the occasional visits of a Circuit Judge, who would correct any error into which the local authority may have fallen. We rejoice over this extension of British authority among the sea-coast populations between the River Volta, and the territory of Dahomey, and look for a great tide of prosperity, and advance of civilization in those districts.""}, {'id': 5069, 'article_title': 'Quittah', 'full_section_title': 'Quittah', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1885#article-5', 'issue_date': '01_04_1885', 'content': ""Quittah is the eastern boundary of the Gold Coast Colony, which has a coast-line of 350 miles in extent. The shore here is scarcely visible from seawards. It is universally flat, and were it not for the solitary palms here and there erect, and the heavy surf which breaks upon it, it would be possible for a ship to run almost on it before those on board became aware of its contiguity. Quittah is one of the most desolate and deserted-looking towns we possess on this coast. Here are the remains of an old fort erected by the English many years back, which indicates that in former days it used to be a place of more importance than now. It used to be the head-quarters of the large naval force we maintained in this part of the world for the suppression of the slave-trade, and the town itself was of importance as a port of observation for checking the trade on the land side. Now slavery on the West Coast of Africa is entirely dead, and this place, to which slavery once gave an air of importance, is itself in a moribund condition. The recent annexations of Germany, however, which have given that Power as a neighbour in this quarter of the globe, promise once more to bring Quittah into notoriety as being the frontier town of our colony. Quittah is situated on a low strip of land between the sea and a large lagoon in connexion with the River Volta and the numerous lakes which stretch along the coast to the westward, so that its water communication with the more inland country is very great. For this reason it is one of the best places on the coast—in fact, almost the only place, where live-stock is procurable, and the men-of-war cruisers on the West Coast of Africa call here periodically to obtain fresh provisions. Bullocks, sheep, turkeys, ducks, and fowls are cheap, and obtainable in large quantities, and the sale of them to calling ships is the only trade the natives indulge in. Strange to say, there is very little European trade here. The only factory at Quittah is a German one; and in view of the recent acquisition of the adjoining territory by Germany, and the advantages to be enjoyed from a residence there, this trading house will ere long be removed to German territory. Though Quittah is the most eastern portion of the Gold Coast Colony, up till recently our protected territory extended as far as Great Popo, some miles further on. This was strip actually indicated on the maps published by the Colonial Office as British territory; but a few months back Dr. Nachtigal commenced his mission of annexation by hoisting the German flag over this whilom possession of ours, and the English Government have, notwithstanding the protestations of their officers in this quarter of the globe, and the surprise and indignation of Europeans and natives generally, acquiesced in this filching of English territory, and indicated to the authorities out here that no adverse steps are to be taken in regard to Germany's proceedings on the coast—in fact, that they are to be viewed with a friendly eye, and, we suppose, a helping hand. At any rate, this is how the Germans interpret our action, or rather want of action, because only lately some correspondence from German officials out here to native chiefs on the coast fell into the hands of the Governor of the Gold Coast Colony, in which these gentlemen stated that their master, the Emperor of Germany, was a great and sincere friend of the Queen of England, and that it was the wish and desire of the latter that the native chiefs on the West Coast of Africa should place themselves under German protection. The discovery of this correspondence has caused intense disgust and annoyance, though there is no doubt that the British Government will treat the matter with silent contempt, and not even request an explanation from the Berlin Government on the subject. The Gold Coast Government have, on account of the annexation of adjoining country by the Germans, found it necessary to increase the police force at this place, so as to prevent smuggling across the frontiers. There is no doubt that numbers of the chiefs along the coast view with great disfavour this attempt of the Teutonic race to mix itself up with the future of this portion of the Dark Continent. Even at the points at present occupied by Germany she has not succeeded in getting the unanimous consent or approval of the chiefs to her action, and some of them have not only protested against and repudiated it, but have even gone so far as to demand English intervention, alleging that they are under the protection of Great Britain, and have declared their determination to resist German intervention by force of arms. If this intention be adhered to, it opens out an unpleasant prospect for that country, as the bombardment of any part of this coast-line by the German man-of-war would be useless either as a reprisal or coercive measure, and any successful attempt to enforce German authority would necessitate an extensive military expenditure from home and involve a large expenditure, neither of which measures would be at all to Prince Bismarck's liking. The native chiefs complain loudly and bitterly at their abandonment by the English Government, whom they have long regarded as their protectors. On the other hand, from the progress of events so far, it appears that the Germans do not intend, at any rate at present, to make any attempts to colonize the portions of territory they have annexed. They have not sent out any officials to govern any part of the coast that has already come into their possession, and apparently they intend, for the time being, to content themselves with having hoisted the German national ensigns along a considerable portion of the coast, having their vessels of war out here to exercise supervision over and maintain authority therein. The English traders who are settled in this newly annexed territory are naturally aggrieved at this. Heretofore they thought the various chiefs maintained order in a rough-and-ready sort of way in these parts, and the periodical visits of the English men-of-war on this coast kept things perfectly quiet. Now this is all changed, and without any compensating advantages. Manifestly English men-of-war can no longer interfere within what is de facto German territory, nor can the English traders maintain order through the chiefs; so that a general reign of lawlessness seems to be inevitable—a fact which will have a by no means beneficial effect on the adjoining English colony. The Germans do not at present either intend to levy any duties on either exports or imports passing through their territory, which therefore promises to be a huge smuggling depôt for the Gold Coast Colony, and necessitating a large addition to the police force for the purpose of watching the frontier to prevent the smuggling of contraband goods. These facts will clearly show that the action of the Germans will not tend to promote the peace and welfare of the West African Coast, and one really fails to see what possible advantage it can prove to Germany herself. The number of German traders in this part of the world is comparatively few. By far the larger number of the foreigners within the recently acquired German territory are Englishmen; and if Germany really intends to found a colonial empire, she should have selected some part of the world possessing greater natural advantages than the West Coast of Africa, and with a less pestilential climate. A careful study of the past, present, and probable future of the English Gold Coast Colony, and the example of the many European nations who have held possessions on this coast, and have afterwards, for various reasons, abandoned them, would have deterred such a sagacious and far-seeing statesman as Prince Bismarck from embarking in such a perilous enterprise. Many misunderstandings are sure to arise between Great Britain and Germany respecting this coast, which will not be worth fighting about. Look at it how we may, calculate in whatever manner we choose, the possibilities that Africa offers for commerce and trade, one great and salient fact remains, and cannot be overcome; by any amount of theorising: the climate of the West Coast of Africa is too much for the white man; it seems to be the only portion of the globe he cannot conquer in that respect.

This trade especially concerned Manchester and the district around, because the bulk of the goods that went to the West Coast were cotton goods.

A few persons were sold in times of famine or for debt. But the majority of slaves were apparently taken by kidnapping, raiding and wars. The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda. Accordingly, the extensive influence exercised by the Aro over Igboland through its oracle did not become an integrative force.$^{9}$ The element of violence inherent in Aro addiction to the slave trade thus distinguished their influence from the earlier ritual influ› ence of the Nri people over wide areas of Igboland.\nIn the economic sphere also, the disruption to normal agricultural activities must have been considerable. In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars.

As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts. The extent to which popular discontent surfaced more frequently during the second half of the century suggests growing class antagonisms as did slave uprisings in Lozi society and on the prazos.""\nIn other instances trading interests, independent of the rulers, were able to dominate commerce and undercut the position of the political authorities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The new changes resulted from a combination of factors, including the nineteenth-century wars which, as in Yorubaland, had the effect of ren› dering the coastal areas relatively safe and attractive to migration from the hinterlands in which most of the fighting took place; the sea-borne trade which was rendered permanent by the transition from slave to 'legitimate' trade, thereby conferring a definite economic advantage on the coastal regions; and the steady growth of European interest, which enlarged the traditional role of selected coastal towns such as Lagos, Porto Novo and eventually Cotonou to take on new and increasing responsibilities not only as ports but also as political capitals of emergent colonial states and their independent African successors.\nIn all these changes, however, the economic factor would appear to have been the most dominant, especially with reference to the European presence. Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa.

Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Social and economic transformation', 'content': 'Evidence has been accumulated to show that the nineteenth century wit› nessed major social transformations in Africa, especially in the nature of slavery and through the rise of both a warrior class and a politically powerful merchant class. These facilitated, partly caused, and were also in part the result of the changes we have noted above in the political structures and military systems. More than that, there was a growing demand for labour outside the customary bounds of the household unit, the village community or age grade associations. While the various societies remained resistant to freemen selling their labour, the predominant tendency in the nineteenth century was towards expansion of the scale of slave labour, an increase in the areas in which enforced labour was used, and a greater use of migrant labour. The general trend in the third quarter of the nineteenth century was for increased slaveholding in general, even in rural areas, an increase in the number of slaves held within each household, and an increase in the use of slaves in production under quasi-capitalist conditions, thus making their lives harsher than ever before. 18 With the intensification of political rivalries from the very beginning of the century, it became usual to press disputes over land, cattle, and even doctrinal differences to the point of completely destroying the enemy as an identifiable entity. Whole communities were incorporated into existing polities or dispersed and the bulk of the young men and women taken away as captives. Such captives were used to satisfy the increasing demand for labour in agriculture, craft production and mining and also as warriors in the emerging professional armies. The new state structures and military systems diminished the importance of the old aristocracies, whose members had depended on the accumulation of wives and extended families for their social, economic and political support, but they also created new bureaucratic groups that needed to be freed from normal agricultural duties. These new aristocracies depended not on large kinship groups as such, but on large households of clients and captives who maintained increasingly large farms to provision the household as well as groups of warriors at the battlefront. They were also deployed to produce goods for the local markets and for long-distance trade, so as to acquire the wealth necessary to attract more clients and buy imported arms and ammunition.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The abolitionist movement produced other far-reaching consequences for the area; of these, perhaps the most significant were those concerned with the modernization process.

These changes naturally affected, in turn, the culture of these three areas, and contributed to a sharper distinction and discrimination of each region's peculiar culture. 48 Part of this reality, of course, was the bewildering variation in the situation in which an arriving African could find himself. In the Caribbean, the Africans formed the majority of the population. The phenotype was self-evidently black. In the USA on the other hand, black phenotypes were a minority of the national population, however concentrated they might have been in some individual states. In parts of Latin America such as Ecuador, Chile and Argentina, the blacks had virtually disappeared genetically among the American Indian and European groups, illustrating a broad spectrum of biological intermixture. 49 Nor did the demographic evolution of the regions follow the logical pattern of relative participation in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The AfroAmerican components of American societies did not necessarily correspond to the proportion of Africans imported during the centuries of the slave trade. Brazil, for example, imported about 4 million slaves during the course of the trade, a figure which, as we have noted, was approximately 38 per cent of the trans-Atlantic trade.$^{50}$ At the end of slavery in 1890, Brazil had an Afro-American population of about 4 million, which comprised 33 per cent of the local Brazilian population and about 36 per cent of the total Afro-American population of the western hemisphere. The Caribbean region imported approximately 5 million slaves, or 43 per cent of the trade, and when the last Caribbean island to abolish slavery - Cuba - did so in 1886, the region had a mere 3 million Afro-Americans, which, while they averaged about 60 per cent of the local regional population, accounted for only 18 per cent of the total Afro-Americans in the hemisphere. The USA received about 0.5 million Africans from the trade, or about 4.5 per cent, but had an Afro-American population of about 4.5 million at the end of slavery there in 1865.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well. In the 1840s the impact of such measures in Algiers was particularly great as the French strove to control cholera. 47', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Social and economic transformation', 'content': 'With the effective end of the Atlantic slave trade and the increased demand for gold, palm oil, palm kernels and peanuts from western Africa, sugar cane from Mauritius, RØunion and the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean, as well as ivory and cloves from East and Central Africa, there was an increased demand for captives not only to produce these goods, but also to transport them by headload or by canoes down to the coast. Plantation slavery emerged, either in the form of slave settlements in the rural areas managed according to customary law on the Guinea coast, or Islamic law in the Muslim areas, or approximating to American-type plantations in the Indian Ocean islands. With the increased use of people of slave origin as warriors and in administrative positions at various courts, it has been estimated that in many parts of Africa slave populations could range between 25 and 50 per cent of the total population.$^{19}$ Although there were examples of slave revolts, and the particular example of the Lozi who threw off their Kololo overlords,$^{20}$ generally the slave populations did not form a distinct class. The bulk performed menial jobs, largely as agricultural labourers. However the substantial groups of warriors and domestic slaves, and the significant few who rose to positions of trust and power as successful warriors, traders or administrators, and the variations in their fortunes and life styles, made combination as a class of slaves very difficult. Only in places like Old Calabar, where the slaves were permanently alienated, with little inclination to integrate them culturally, and with a tradition of competition among the ruling elite to show off wealth by the number of slaves killed in funeral ceremonies,$^{21}$ did the slaves in the agricultural villages combine in a secret cult to demand improved conditions. Elsewhere, the prevalent ethos was acculturation and integration into the society through individual households. While the degree of integration was clearly limited - as witnessed by the number anxious to be redeemed or, having been emancipated by colonial laws, who were anxious to return to their original homes - it was real enough to suggest that the dynamics of change in most of the African communities was the tension of age and sex within each household, and of status and competition for power between the lineages and kinship groups, rather than between broad classes in society.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.722, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The impact of Africa', 'content': 'Where they could - and where they had no other recourse - Africans and Afro-Americans adjusted to the conditions in which they found them› selves.

Of course, the more they needed and the less they found, the more they became creative as the patois speech pattern of the previously French eastern Caribbean islands and the papiamento of the previously Dutch Antilles reveal. Cre› ativity became especially necessary where a small number of Europeans lived among a large number of Africans as was the case in many colonies of exploitation such as Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Saint-Domingue. Where the European population failed to comprise a critical mass, the Africans had to build a society from a diverse collectivity of individuals who had little more in common than their skin colour and their servility. The adoption of their customs and behaviour by the non-African sector indicated the measure of their success.\nAfricans did not always conform to the society into which they were thrust. For centuries marronage, or the flight from the slave system, existed as an integral aspect of slavery.$^{53}$ In Brazil, the north-east witnessed the establishment of the quilombo of Palmares which lasted almost a century and which was eliminated only with the largest military force ever mounted in the Americas by the Portuguese and Brazilians. Maroon towns existed for equally long periods in Esmeraldas in Ecuador and in parts of the Blue Mountains and the Cockpit Country of Jamaica. Marronage manifested not only the wish to be free, it was an eloquent and visible condemnation of the system of slavery by Africans.\nBy the time African slavery was eliminated in the Americas, the position of the African sector had worsened dramatically from what it had been a century before. The political and economic reconstruction that followed the Civil War in the USA accompanied a movement of legal discrimination and social and economic exclusion of the non-white sector, characterized by segregated institutions, lynchings, and overtly racist societies and organ› izations, which combined until the middle of the twentieth century.$^{54}$ The general conditions experienced by black Americans then compared with those prevailing today in a more extreme way in South Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The impact of Africa', 'content': 'While slavery persisted, the majority of Africans and Afro-Americans served either as agricultural field hands, or in domestic service.

Indeed, in the later eighteenth century Edward Long was complaining that a substantial proportion of the currency in Jamaica was in the hands of this sector of the population, and that they monopolized the transportation systems overland as well as along the coast. 52 This situation did not change very much after slavery was abolished, although the number of peasant farmers of African descent increased sharply in the Caribbean. Occupation and biological heritage could and did increase class and caste mobility both during and after slavery. An individual or a family could work their way outward and often upward from slavery to freedom, or from free black to mulatto (especially in Brazil and Spanish America), or from mulatto to white (an exceptional achievement requiring a considerable amount of money) when the indices of race were more strongly cultural than biological. By the later eighteenth century some Spanish American planters and merchants, doubtful of their status, bought certificates from the Crown, called limpieza de sangre, which certified that they had no Moorish or Jewish ancestors in at least the preceding four generations. Ultimately, however, internal social mobility and the general quality of life depended on the immediate circumstances of the community: on factors of demography, economy, law, social and political philosophy, and degree of cultural pluralism.

The institutions of slavery slowly crumbled from within and without. The curious combination of political freedom which gave white Americans a greater voice in their internal affairs, economic selfinterest, humanitarianism, imperial incompatibility, and the unquenchable thirst for liberty on the part of the enslaved, ultimately destroyed the American slave system.$^{44}$ The political independence of the USA after 1776, Haiti after 1804, the mainland Spanish colonies after 1825, and Brazil after 1822, gave a different complexion to the political dimension of the system of slavery and the slave trade, and had repercussions outside the parochial boundaries of each empire, colony and state.\nThe loss of the British North American colonies in 1783 and the termination of the British slave trade in 1808 affected slavery and the African in profound ways. The largest and most efficient supplier removed itself from the market, and began an intensive campaign to persuade other European states to follow its example. The British anti-slavery campaign sharply reduced the number of Africans taken to the Americas during the nineteenth century, although the total remains high. Before the trade ended in 1870, the pattern returned to that which prevailed during its first century.$^{45}$ The Spanish and Portuguese colonies again became the major importers. Of the nearly 2 million Africans who arrived in the New World during this period, more than 1.1 million (or about 60 per cent) went to Brazil. More than 600000 (about 31.9 per cent) went to the Spanish Antilles, with the greater proportion by far going to Cuba.

In some cases, the influences from Africa were strong enough and pervasive enough to forge a genuine Afro-American culture competing with, and sometimes complementing the Europeanderived culture.\nIn the USA the political-structure imposed a rigid dichotomy between black and white in the population, relegating any individual with any degree of African ancestry to the category of black.$^{51}$ By contrast, throughout the rest of the hemisphere a three-tiered social categorization prevailed, corres› ponding to the dominant groups of black, mixed, and white.

Taking a bird's-eye view of the whole situation in time and space, so that each factor might assume its proper relative position and proportion, he unhesitatingly affirmed in the plainest language that so far their intercourse with African races, instead of being a blessing, had been little better than an unmitigated curse to them. These were strong statements, they would say, and required confirmation. If true, what could possibly have caused this frightful miscarriage of the noblest aspirations of a Christian people? The answer was simply the nature of their commerce with Africa in the past and present. To the slave and gin trades, and that in gunpowder and guns, must he ascribed the frightful evils they had brought upon the negro race, beside which the good they had tried to achieve was hardly discernible."", 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.616, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICAN PROSPECTS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Another and an important step has been made toward the civilization of Africa.

This trade, once inaugurated, was carried on by the Egyptians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and Europeans down to the end of the last century, when the revival of human feeling urged certain philanthropists in England to move towards the abolition of a great evil. But during all this period the negro himself was as much to blame as the white and yellow men; indeed, it was probable that negroes were enslaving negroes long before Egyptian or Arab bought black servants from the negro chiefs, and at the present day there would be no slavery in Africa if an approval of slavery were not present in the philosophy of the negro tribes of Africa. Slavery and the slave trade, with the tribal wars and their attendant insecurity, had been the cause of Africa's backward condition, and if ever that Continent were to be raised to the civilisation of Europe, slavery and the slave trade must be extirpated. The two great slave markets which, until a few years ago, had existed in America, and in Turkey and Persia rendered the inducements to slave traders so great that the guarding of the coasts of Africa by British cruisers only checked the trade in a very slight degree; and even now many slaves were sent to Arabia, Persia, and Madagascar. In the present day, however, Africa was the main consumer of its own slaves. The most remarkable revival of the slave trade and occurred in German East Africa. The Germans, under Major Von Wissmann, began by suppressing a revolt of the Arab slave dealers, which led to the almost complete extinction of the oversea slave traffic on the German coast of East Africa; but the organisation of a strong government led to the rapid settling down of the Arabs as great landed proprietors, with an unlimited number of slaves to work their plantations. Legally slavery could not exist in German territory, but in such a wide and sparsely populated region it was impossible to prevent it in fact; and as the slaves were ordinarily well and kindly treated, it never occurred to them to want to leave their masters or to better their condition. It might be asked where, then, was the harm of slavery? The harm lay in this, that slavery commenced with an initial evil. The speaker then drew a picture of the loss of life, devastation of countries, and breaking of family ties which attended a capture of slaves. This depopulation of whole regions was attended with another evil, the return of the dreaded tsetse fly; and the surest way of extirpating this pest was to encourage population in the fertile districts of Central Africa. They must not expect much from the people themselves. The slave who once reached the East or West Coast was quite happy in his slavery; and, indeed, he would sooner proceed to an Arabian household or a Turkish harem than to the plain living of a Christian mission.

Lagos has for many years had a large trade carried on by British and other European merchants, yet this did not prevent it from being at the same time the head-quarters of slavery in the Bights. At Whydah an extensive trade in palm-oil has existed since 1849, and yet slaves have been regularly shipped from that port up to the present day, and, as has been already stated, a cargo was awaiting embarkation there in December last. Nor is this difficult to explain; palm-oil, which forms the principle article of trade, is collected by natives, chiefly domestic slaves, residing at or near the coast, its weight and bulk preventing it from being brought from a great distance in a country where there are no rivers; and it is evident that it would answer the chiefs better to turn their labour to account in this way than to sell them for exportation, even were not the customs of the country entirely opposed to such a proceeding. There is nothing, however, to prevent the chiefs from purchasing for export any number of the slaves captured in the hunts which are regularly undertaken for this purpose in certain parts of the interior, and so legitimate commerce and the slave-trade may be found combined in any spot on the coast to which British authority or influence does not extend.\n\nThus the existence of the British settlements, and of the Republic of Liberia, has served to eradicate the slave-trade from all but one spot on the 1,500 miles of coast extending from the Gambia to Quittah; and the recent acquisition of Lagos may be said to have freed almost entirely from the curse the remainder of the coast; the two exceptions being the small spot between the Gambia and Sierra Leone, the case of which has already been referred to in the report on the latter colony, and a portion of the sea coast lying between Quittah and Lagos, immediately in the rear of which are the dominions of the notorious King of Dahomey.\n\nIt is well known that, from the peculiar circumstances of his country, this monarch is indebted for his wealth and the maintenance of his authority over his people almost exclusively to the slave-trade.

L. Cameron, R.N., C.B. The Earl of Dundonald was in the chair.\n\nCommander Lovett Cameron, in the course of his opening remarks, said the slave trade went on all round the continent of Africa, and commerce had gone on with it. Our trade with the West Coast of Africa had gone on since the time of the Tudors. For centuries that trade was in slaves, and its increase was slow; but after several blows had been struck at that trade—among others by the liberation of slaves in the West Indian Islands, in America, and in Cuba—instead of their being any injury done to our commerce, our trade with the West Coast of Africa increased by leaps and bounds. It was only in 1850 or shortly after that we attacked a great nest of slave dealers in Lagos, and in 1861 it was made a British colony. Up to that time there had been no trade there except in slaves; but last year the trade of Lagos amounted to £357,831 imports, and £538,980 exports. And yet only thirty-eight years ago that place was of absolutely no value to us for legitimate commerce. On the Gold Coast slavery had been practically abolished by the British Government, but yet there was a good deal still existing owing to the native customs of the people. Even if the export of slaves from Africa was prevented entirely, the internal trade in them would still be enormous.\n\nFormerly the slave trade was subsidiary to the ivory trade, but when porters were no longer wanted for the latter, the former remained, only the men were killed and the women and children carried away. It had been said that domestic slavery must be allowed, and that was a very difficult question to settle. In his opinion, we should, as in India, abolish the legal status of slavery, but should not rout out all the households where no complaint was made. As long as domestic slavery existed there would be a market for slaves. We must have nothing to do with slavery; while the slave trade continued it was impossible for legitimate commerce to go on as it should! If the slave trade were done away with, they would find that all other trade would flourish.\n\nIn answer to questions Commander Lovett Cameron said he had avoided speaking of the Germans for diplomatic reasons.\n\nHe had a plan for the total abolition of slavery in Africa, which he hoped to explain shortly. It was, in brief, to establish a barricade across the country by the way of the lakes, and to get authority to maintain order on that line.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, on February 26, presided over a large meeting, held in Exeter Hall, when two African explorers, Commander Cameron and Captain Hore, were announced to speak.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-03-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_03_1889#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.616, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Extensive Slave Trade Practices in Lagos', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Having waited with much impatience in the hope that some one of your many friends here would, through the medium of the African Times and your own instrumentality, expose some grave evils which our authorities overlook, and which are consequently increasing more and more; and, being disappointed, I humbly beg to be excused in asking your indulgence and wonted perseverance whilst I make this attempt at an exposure of one of them.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

Boma and Matadi up the Congo, to which ports vessels from Liverpool are now plying direct, are becoming the chief ports from which produce is being shipped, and the facilities at these places are gradually drawing the ivory trade away from Zanzibar. On the upper reaches of the Congo, Tipoo Tib, who up till quite recently has been held up to execration as a slave-hunter, is now diverting the ivory which hitherto carried by slaves, was taken to Zanzibar and other ports on the East Coast. The Congo State has now its officials at the very spot where the Arabs collect the ivory. Instead of making raids on villages and killing hundreds of natives to obtain slaves to carry the ivory to the East Coast, the Arabs can now sell it to the Congo Free State at Stanley Falls, where a regular ivory market at present exists. The Arabs not requiring carriers have no need of slaves except for domestic purposes, and the terrible traffic is said to be gradually dying out. The road from the Upper Congo at Niangwe and from the Tanganika to the East Coast is a difficult one, and often ivory carried by slaves took one or two years to reach the coast by that route. In the neighbourhood of Stanley Falls the former slave-dealers are forcing themselves into a peaceful colony under Tipoo Tib, who has himself discarded his old slave raids and is employing his energies in ruling the people. It is the belief that the Tanganika-Zanzibar route will ere long be entirely superseded by the Congo route. This is the tendency at present, and when the Congo railway is completed the Congo route will be more availed of. Matadi can be reached by ocean steamers, and from Matadi, which is at the foot of the cataracts, the railway will start. Belgian, French, and Dutch houses are now established at Stanley Pool and are buying the ivory, which formerly found its way by caravans to the Angola Coast.\n\nA magnificent river, running parallel with and to the west of the Congo, has lately been discovered. The river, the Lomami by name, was found easily navigable and with a good depth. The Lomami will allow of the navigable Congo system being brought into direct communication with Niangwe, the chief Arab settlement on the High Congo, the Uangolle Lomami being only at a distance of three days' march from that town. The communication between Niangwe and Stanley Falls by the Congo is almost impossible, owing to the many falls and rapids; and the Lomami will form a further means of extending protection and bringing civilisation to regions which have suffered much from the Arab raids for slaves."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.611, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'REVIEW.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Cooper—now the Nestor of the anti-slavery cause—renders an immense service to it by this, his last contribution to its literature.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country.

During the five years that the standardization of import duties continued in Britain, imports of slaves into Brazil increased by 84 per cent compared with the previous five years, 1841-5.$^{13}$ It paid the American plantation owner to import fresh manpower so long as its purchase price was below $600 a head.

The slave trade was of course a product of, and a key element in, the construction of the European-centred capitalist world-economy that had come into existence c. 1450. By the seventeenth century this capitalist world-economy included as part of its peripheral production areas the 'extended' Caribbean zone of the Americas.

We should be clear that traders tend to favour free trade if they have a competitive advantage in the market and tend to see ways of restraining free trade if and when they do not. Hence the fact that the role of the chartered companies in eighteenth-century West Africa was less than in the seven› teenth century has led some historians to speak of the rise of free trade. The very process of dismantling of the monopoly powers of chartered companies was however 'a gradual one', we are told; the shift to free trade 'was therefore somewhat limited'; and the explanation of the shift resided primarily in 'practical business reasons', to wit, the lower overhead costs and greater flexibility of response to an expanding slave-trade market.$^{46}$ As for the nineteenth-century era of even freer trade, it has been argued that it rather represented a serious restriction of free trade under the ideology of 'legitimate commerce'. 47 Britain's championship of the doctrine of free trade in"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'The Western impetus for abolition', 'content': ""This plan appealed to a section of the public with liberal-philanthropic leanings.

States opposed it in the name of their national sovereignty, for the right of search and joint commissions presupposed a partial surrender of that sovereignty.

Still it was felt that, barring the tariff, 'despite the higher freight, the East Indies could undersell the West' (C.N. Parkinson, 1937, p. 85). What happened then? Given the fact that 'the bigger financiers clearly had a foot in both camps' (ibid., p. 86), the resulting Parliamentary decisions might be seen as a compromise: the West Indian lobby lost on abolition but won on the East Indian tariff.

As in the case of West Africa, the slave trade figured prominently in the process by which the region, especially north of the Zambezi river, became part of the periphery of the international trading system. Despite some basic similarities, there were important differences. Many of the captives were exported to the Indian Ocean plantation system, Madagascar and the Middle East rather than to the New World. There was also the very significant role of the ivory trade, and the fact that the far-reaching changes accompanying this involvement in international trade were compressed into a much shorter time-frame. Moreover, the level of violence that accompanied the slave trade was probably higher in Central Africa, creating unprecedented fragmentation and rural dislocation. While some Central African trading societies, or at least the dominant class within them, benefited in the short run through their participation in the ivory and slave trade, they ultimately became subordinate to and dependent upon the international trading system whose centres of decision-making lay outside Africa. 22 Several factors operated simultaneously to expand the slave trade during the first half of the nineteenth century. As a result of the resurgence of the plantation system in north-eastern Brazil and the subsequent development of sugar estates in Cuba, slave-traders in appreciable numbers from the West Indies and Latin America began to visit Mozambican ports where captives were generally cheaper than in West Africa and the limited British naval force far less intimidating.$^{23}$ Simultaneously, French planters on the islands of Bourbon (now called RØunion), Seychelles and the Mascarenes, as well as the rulers of Madagascar, intensified their demand for slaves. The most significant stimulant, however, was the development of clove plantations on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba shortly after the turn of the century. 24 Conditions within Central Africa facilitated the growing demand for slave labour. Bisa, Yao and Chikunda trade networks already linked the interior to the coastal markets of Kilwa, Mozambique Island and Quelimane. Despite their initial emphasis on ivory, the inland traders had always brought a small but steady supply of slaves to these international entrepôts.

The price per slave had been fixed in advance in the local money of account, the copper bar, equivalent to a specific quantity of goods - the same as in earlier periods.

The demand for East African ivory, however, increased when it was discovered that it was of better quality (softer) and therefore more suitable for making luxury goods, such as combs, billiard balls and piano keys, which the richer classes were demanding. All British efforts to control this trade directly from East Africa failed because Indian merchants were already well entrenched in conducting the trade through Bombay from where it was re-exported to Europe.

Annual exports from Quelimane to Brazil, for example, had increased by 400 per cent between 1800 and 1835.$^{27}$ The newly developed port of Ibo on Mozambique Island, and Kilwa, were doing a booming business, while the post-1844 resurgence of the sultanate of Angoche was directly related to its entrance into the slave trade, and even the southern Mozambican ports of Inhambane and Lourenço Marques, largely ignored by European slavers, became important sec› ondary entrepôts.$^{28}$ Zanzibar remained the principal recipient of these captives, with annual imports increasing from 10 000 per annum in 1810 to at least 20000 in 1850.$^{29}$ Paralleling this growth was a proportionate increase in ivory exports. 30 As the involvement of Angoche suggests, the economic pre-eminence of the Yao, Chikunda and Bisa did not go unchallenged for long. A number of African as well as alien merchants rapidly entered into the competition for slaves and ivory.

This interaction of peoples of varied backgrounds merits further study. 10 The annual pilgrimage to Mecca also played an important, albeit a seasonal, role in the involuntary and voluntary movements of Africans to the Middle East. Many West African pilgrims reached Mecca via the Cairo caravan or by way of the Red Sea ports of Suäkin and Massawa, thereby constituting small diaspora communities.""

Not only African slaves were brought thither for resale, but also Circassians, Malays, Indians and Central Asians. They were then distributed by individual buyers throughout the Muslim world. 13 A small number of Africans stayed back in the holy cities of western Arabia in pursuit of higher religious studies.

In areas dominated by British and Dutch colonial powers, especially in India and the Malay archipelago, slaves, including Africans, provided the base of a plantation economy similar to that found in the Americas.

By the last quarter of the century it was estimated that a quarter of the Lozi population were slaves. Similarly, Nguni dynamism was premised upon their ability to incorporate and extract surplus from their large pool of captives. 51 Allowing for local variations, a broad pattern of economic dislocation resulting from the slave trade is nevertheless discernible. The violent disruption of much of the rural economy, the export of many of the most productive members of the indigenous societies, the inadvertent introduction of highly contagious diseases, and the growing dependence of the Central African economy on the world trading system intensified the process of underdevelopment. It is true that this process was accompanied by the dissemination of new crops such as tobacco, maize, rice and cassava, the introduction of modest technological innovations like the Chikunda traps, granaries, and weapons, and the expansion of some local industry. But these were relatively insignificant developments when placed in juxtaposition to the economic retardation of the region as a whole. 52 Little needs to be said about the unprecedented level of destruction that While slavery had been a feature of many Central African societies before the slave trade, preliminary evidence suggests a growing tendency to acquire captives to extract surplus which the aristocracy used to maintain its privileged position. To the extent that slaves acquired as corvØe labourers tended to become chattel, the nature of slavery often changed from earlier forms which emphasized the reproductive role and the use of slaves primarily to expand the size of the kinship network. accompanied the raids and the expansionist activities of the slave-traders. Fields were ravished, entire villages destroyed and survivors often com› pelled to flee their homelands and resettle in inaccessible, unproductive locations. One nineteenth-century traveller recalled the effect of the Yao raids in the 1860s against the Manganja: A number of the Manganja went with them. Everywhere they saw sad signs of the war - villages burnt, gardens uncared for, the beautiful land about them rapidly becoming desert. About midday they came upon a large party of Ajawa [Yao], who were just returning from a successful raid. The smoke of burning villages was seen in the distance.

We hold her to her bargain. We will not have any return of this money. She must perform the obligation she undertook to perform. Her non-performance of it costs us nearly 500,000l. a year. The whole of our slave-trade suppression expenses are caused by her. All other countries have now effectually abandoned and prohibited the importation of Africans into any portion of their dominions. All our expensive machinery for putting down the slave-trade is therefore forced upon us by Spain. Every year brings with it a new pecuniary sacrifice of 500,000l. by us on her account.\n\nNow rich though we are, no doubt, we are not rich enough for this. It is nearly a halfpenny income-tax. Why should we pay an income-tax to Spain? If she forces us to expend that money, which she does, because we cannot set aside our Christian principles, as she sets aside her pecuniary and honourable obligations, let us exact it from her. It can be done; and as it can be done, it ought to be done. The universal voice of the country ought to demand of the Government that it be done. They must put on the screw, or that halfpenny income-tax for Spain will stick by us for ever. And the mode of applying the screw is simple enough. We must take the money out of the profits that the Cuban planters are making by this infamous employment of the African slave-trade.\n\nWhy do they use the African slave-trade and import slaves? To force, on their rich soil, the growth of sugar for the English market. This is past all doubt; it is established by undeniable facts. About 1845 the prosperity of Cuba was at a low ebb. Spain advances slowly as a consumer of sugar. She advanced so slowly, that the Cuban planter, not having access to the English market, had no inducement to increase his production of sugar. Plantations were going out of cultivation. Not more than 2,000 slaves were imported from Africa in a year. It was hoped in England that Spain was really preventing the importation. But it was no such thing. The importation was no longer very profitable; it was, therefore, being gradually discontinued.

We conferred this great advantage gratuitously upon Spain. It was hoped that the prosperity this would necessarily bestow upon the Island of Cuba would induce the Spanish Government and the people of that island entirely to suppress and discontinue the importation of slaves. But the greed of gain prevailed over humanity, honour, and justice. The English market for Cuban sugar was a mine of wealth for Cuba. She determined to work it with all her might. She set at defiance every other consideration.\n\nThe importation of African slaves into Cuba rose to 40,000 a year. The importation of Cuban sugar into England, within ten years after England was opened to it, reached nearly 2,000,000 cwts. a year! last year it rather exceeded 2,000,000 cwts. Our whole importation, from all sources, is now 10,645,259 cwts., and we consumed last year 9,400,765 cwts. a year. Cuba is revelling in wealth. Spain is deriving a large increase of revenue from that island, in consequence of the admission of sugar from Cuba into England; and the means which one has adopted, and the other has connived at, for enabling that wealth and that increase of revenue to be obtained, costs Great Britain 500,000l. a year. Instead, then, of a halfpenny income-tax in England to raise this 500,000l. a year, let us levy it upon the wealth of Cuba and the revenue of Spain derived from that island.\n\nThere is no living free trade advocate—whoever he may be—that would more strongly deprecate any abandonment of the principles of free trade than we should do.

The importations from Cuba, although large, are only to the extent of one-fifth of our consumption; and the price of Cuban sugar in the market is therefore governed by the price of sugar of other origin. The duty, therefore, will fall upon Cuba. The Cuban planters as a body will be vitally interested in preventing the landing of another African negro slave in the island; and the Spanish Government will have a like interest.\n\nUnder these circumstances, we do not believe that there would be any increase in the price of sugar in England in consequence of the exceptional duty on that of Cuba. But should there be, it would not exceed 1s. per cwt. If such an incident of taxation as this is to prevent our adoption of the only pacific means we possess for accomplishing the annihilation of the African slave-trade with Cuba, the world will be entitled to say that we are, as a nation, the most exalted and unblushing hypocrites of the earth. Many in this country denied themselves the use, and enjoined the disuse, of sugar before our slaves were emancipated, because the sugar was produced by slave labour, though slaves had long ceased to be imported into our colonies.

I heard his Excellency the Governor has expressed his opinion in this wise—viz., that his force, not being strong enough to avenge any insult done to the British flag on the part of the natives, he would rather not occupy the fort at all.\n\nIn the meantime, we are left to our fate—i.e., to do as well as we can without a Government, and we manage it pretty well, except the slave-trade. This is going on in a splendid style. The country is full of money—American doubloons, twenty-dollar gold pieces, &c.—which is, no doubt, money that has been paid for slaves. People who formerly traded in palm oil now buy slaves, and every petty trader invests his little money in this more profitable trade. The slaves coming from the interior by the River Volta are sent down to Popo and Ahguay; and the people of the latter places also send money here to the traders to buy slaves for them. The other day I heard of a native (a palm-oil trader at Addah) to whom 500 dollars had been sent by a gentleman of Popo to buy ten slaves for him. There being such a good market for slaves at Popo and Ahguay, I suppose there must be many more vessels making their escape than is asserted by officers of Her Majesty\'s men of war; and all this in spite of the new treaty with the United States of America.\n\nBeing a witness of this every day, you will find it natural that I am sorry that Her Majesty\'s Government does not take any measures to prevent this trade, which is surely the ruin of the country, and which might be done away with by the reoccupation of the Fort of Quittah. Of course the reoccupation must be with a commandant who would not betray his duty to a slave-dealer for a few good dinners. Before the fort was abandoned we had little or no slave-trade.

We cannot forget that, on those 1,000 slaves alone, the King obtains a fancied profit of some 10,000l., which we enable the Cuban planters to send him, through the slave-traders, for the supply of the raw material out of which they manufacture sugar for us. We are compelled to bear in mind that at the rate of duty he levies on palm oil shipped at Whydah—viz., one dollar per puncheon—there must be a very large exportation of produce to compensate him for relinquishing the slave-trade. We have also recently obtained a new insight into the dreadful ""Customs"" of Dahomey—of the supposed obligation on the part of the monarch to continue them during his life; and Aboekuta, though a hard nut, perhaps, to crack, has in its numerous population a delicious kernel for the wholesale butcher and slave-dealer. Nevertheless, we hail with joy this manifestation on the part of the King of a desire to enter into some amicable relations with the Christian civilization of this country. And we do indeed earnestly hope that advantage will be taken of it by Her Majesty\'s Government. We stated in our last that Commodore A.

The King asks for the light to be brought to him; and such a desire ought to be immediately gratified. It may be only curiosity on his part, or a desire for the presents which he well knows he will receive; or to raise himself still higher in the opinion of his people, through that acknowledgment of him as king by this great nation; or it may be only a ruse on his part, to lull the Aboekutans into a fancied security, so that they may become an easier prey. Still, his desire ought to be complied with; the wishes, and, if necessary, the demands, of this Christian country ought to be diplomatically placed before him.

But it was in the negro barracks that the hideous features of this \'sum of all villainies\' came out. The dwellings stood round a large square, which was entered through double iron gates. \'As we passed in,\' says the writer, \'two ferocious-looking Cuban bloodhounds chained, one on either side of the gate, sniffed suspiciously near our legs, but being trained to run down or attack negroes only, did not molest us.\' On the ground floor were the negroes\' rooms, secured by heavily-barred and padlocked doors. These rooms were veritable dens, walls black with dirt, uneven floors about fourteen feet square, no means of letting in air or daylight, and the whole in a condition impossible to describe. \'In each of these pestiferous dungeons a whole family lived, in a condition more foul and degraded than any beasts of the field.\' \'We looked into several, and found them all alike.\' Mounting a staircase, at the foot of which another bloodhound was chained, they found themselves in a gallery running round the court, out of which opened large and tolerably ventilated rooms, used as sick wards, nurseries, and for other purposes. Here were scores of children of every shade \'from jet black to nearly white,\' happy enough in their childish ignorance, \'playing,\' says Captain Townshend, \'with some bloodhound puppies, little thinking of their unhappy lot, or of the use to which these same puppies would shortly be put.\'', 'last_edit_date': '1874-12-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/31_12_1874#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SLAVE TRADE—CUBA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Our readers may have perceived some allusions in the daily press to an event which had excited some remark in New York—viz., the extradition by the United States Government, at the request of the Cuban authorities, of Don José Augustin Arguelles, or Captain Arguelles. In order that this affair may be quite understood, we may state that the celebrated slave clipper steamer Ciceron landed a cargo of slaves in Cuba, from Dahomey, of from 1,200 to 1,300 individuals. They were landed in the district over which Mr. Arguelles exercised authority as lieutenant-governor. Arguelles captured the whole cargo, and with them Senor Zulueta and other powerful individuals who are engaged as capitalists in the nefarious traffic. These persons, although caught ""in flagrante,"" although taken in the very act, have proved themselves to be sufficiently powerful to free themselves from all condemnation and to obtain the ruin of the man who had interfered with their unholy gains. There was a difference between the number of slaves seized and the number surrendered to the supreme authorities of the island. Zulueta and his worthy companions denounced Arguelles to the captain-general as having sold that number of slaves which constituted the difference alluded to. Arguelles maintains that the negroes thus deficient in the surrender were given by him to the parties to whom he is represented as having sold them—given by him for the aid and assistance rendered by those persons in effecting the capture, and as a price indeed agreed to be paid to them for that assistance. And considering the slave-trade morality of the island, this cannot be considered impossible. But as Zulueta and his brother slave-trade capitalists denounced Arguelles, so the persons who had thus received the slaves from Arguelles swore that they did not receive them as a gift, but that they paid from 700* to 750 dollars each for them, while Arguelles maintains that the only crime of which he has been guilty was in so far exceeding his instructions and the intentions of the chief authority, as to have captured such powerful people, such mighty slavetraders, as Zulueta and his friends. And we must say that the impunity which these people enjoy, although they were thus taken in the very act of having superintended the landing of the cargo, &c., of which they were proprietors, leads very strongly to the supposition, by those who know something of the purity of Spanish administration and of Spanish local law courts in such matters, that Arguelles may after all not be the guilty person he has been stated to be, and has been condemned as being. He is now a convict in the slave gang, while Zulueta and his friends are at liberty to arrange for retrieving the loss Arguelles inflicted on them in capturing an otherwise safely-landed cargo of 1,200 slaves, worth to them one million of dollars, or 200,000l.—to arrange for retrieving this by importing other cargoes in the Ciceron from Dahomey.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1864#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Important Slave-trade Papers Just Published', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs to Sir J.

The Gambia, the Grain, Gold, and Slave Coasts; Lagos; the Niger; the so-called Oil Rivers; the Gaboon; the Congo—at all of which the foreign slave traders made, throughout a couple of centuries, their abominable purchases of the poor kidnapped children of Africa, for the supply of the sugar and cotton fields of the Antilles, the United States, and Brazil—are now, happily, freed, thanks to the persistent and costly efforts of Great Britain, from the presence of the foreign dealer in human flesh and blood. Legitimate commerce has, in all these places, been making of late a very satisfactory progress; and a number of educated Africans constantly advancing in intelligence and wealth, give the lie to those sneerers at the universal brotherhood of man, who, because of the opprobrium which had fallen on the African race, as a natural consequence of their exposure from age to age as victims in the slave markets of the world, denied them those rights of humanity to which all but the black-skinned negro were admitted to be more or less entitled. It is one of the many great glories of the nineteenth century to have rolled away the stone from the door of the sepulchre of long-buried human rights in Africa; and we confidently believe that long ere the first sunrise of the twentieth century shall gladden the earth, all African slave trade and slavery will have become unknown, save in the dreadful records of the past.\n\nWe, the Editor of the African Times, are led into these remarks by a notice in the Daily News, on this last day but one of 1874, of a work recently published by Captain E. Trench Townshend, who has been lately in the Island of Cuba, and may be depended on as a faithful witness of the sad condition of the poor African and Chinese slaves employed, or rather in constant process of being murdered, on the Cuban plantations. Surely the prayer of every Christian West African ought to rise daily to heaven, in supplication that God will avenge the innocent blood, and free the captives from their hideous thrall.

They would be satisfied if they were allowed to import free negroes from Africa, but they cannot risk losing all their workmen at once. But a beginning has been made. In one room we saw a lot of little free children—those born since September, 1868, who according to law are never to be reduced to slavery. All the the men who are upwards of sixty are also free, but their freedom is of very little use to them, as that is an advanced age for a negro, and when he has attained it he is hardly able to take care of himself. But this process of emancipation is too slow, and the Cubans know that the question must come on for solution after the suppression of the insurrection.""—*Standard*, April 3, 1872.\n\n[We enter our protest against any such mode of ""satisfying"" the Cuban planters, as above suggested. ""If they were allowed to import free negroes from Africa"" a pretty sort of freedom they would be likely to enjoy on the Cuban plantations. No, there can be no more supplies sent there from Africa.

But, putting all conjectural treasure aside, over all the coast regions, and up the Sabaki river, there is ample scope for plantation work. To the south of Mount Kenia are large districts, fertile and salubrious.\n\nIn the Witu and Tana district cotton cultivation is making progress, and an account is given of the working and results of a plantation at Wange, near the port of Lamu, the crop of which amounted to 80,000lb. ""lint cotton"" (Sea Island), 140,000lb. of cotton seed, and 20,000lb. of refuse. Samples have been valued at a higher assessment than that of American cotton then in the market. According to returns the profit on an expenditure of under £1,200 was £370, or over 30 per cent. In Liverpool this cotton, is pronounced ""better than any but the best Egyptian."" The natives are said to be anxious to grow cotton, and it would undoubtedly pay a planter to establish at Lamu machinery for cleaning and pressing cotton for export. On the cotton estates cocoanut trees have been planted and do not interfere with the cultivation of cotton.\n\nSatisfactory reports are given of the tobacco cultivation at Witu; and very full information is given as to the possibilities of cultivation of a variety of commercial products; and with regard to the interior, evidence is given that the American rubber trees might be introduced and flourish as well as the indigenous *Landolphia*. The report is so full of detail and so useful that the Company ought to print it for circulation. It shows that Sir William Mackinnon and his friends have really got hold of a ""good thing"" commercially, which, with judicious management, may in the future yield satisfactory results.\n\nOne interesting point as regards slavery is brought out in the report. The Company have granted freedom papers to 2,634 slaves. It was the practice of Government to grant a bonus of £5 per head to the mission societies who took charge of released slaves, and, as no allowance is made to the Company, the sum of £13,140 has been saved to the Treasury. In addition to this work there is the benefit of the law for self-redemption of slaves which the Company put in operation and which is working so satisfactorily.', 'last_edit_date': '1893-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1893#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True
268,The transatlantic slave trade caused profound demographic shifts and social disruptions in African societies.,"The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that the transatlantic slave trade caused profound demographic shifts and social disruptions in African societies. The textbook highlights the massive loss of population due to the slave trade, leading to underpopulation and contributing to the underdevelopment of African economies. It describes how the slave trade destabilized political and economic structures, causing a perpetual ebb and flow in state systems and administrative centers. The procurement of slaves through kidnapping, raiding, and wars destroyed social and political structures, exacerbating instability. The economic impact was significant, as local industries were undermined by the importation of foreign goods in exchange for slaves. The demographic impact is illustrated by emigration rates and the substantial loss of life during capture and transport. The abolition of the slave trade introduced structural imbalances, and the continued demand for slaves in the nineteenth century led to further social transformations, including the rise of a warrior class and a politically powerful merchant class. The text also notes the cultural impact, as Africans in the New World influenced and were influenced by the cultures of Africa, the Americas, and Europe. Similarly, The African Times articles describe extensive slave trade activities on the Gold Coast and the Bight of Benin, highlighting the impact on legitimate commerce and the inability of local authorities to curb the trade. They discuss the capture and transportation of slaves, the conditions upon arrival in places like Sierra Leone, and the devastating effects on African communities, such as depopulation and the breaking of family ties. The articles also mention the role of various African and non-African actors, including local chiefs and European powers, in perpetuating the trade, contributing to social disruptions and backward conditions in Africa. However, the articles focus more on internal and regional dynamics within Africa, without explicitly addressing the transatlantic aspect, which is a notable difference as the claim specifically pertains to that aspect of the slave trade.

No one could have escaped the overall depressive and traumatic social and economic effects of the massive loss of population through the slave trade and the attendant wars.$^{8}$ The slave trade seems to provide the best explanation of why in most of Africa, of all continents, the political and economic structures at the beginning of the nineteenth century seem to have remained unstable and fragile. There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.

A few persons were sold in times of famine or for debt. But the majority of slaves were apparently taken by kidnapping, raiding and wars. The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda. Accordingly, the extensive influence exercised by the Aro over Igboland through its oracle did not become an integrative force.$^{9}$ The element of violence inherent in Aro addiction to the slave trade thus distinguished their influence from the earlier ritual influ› ence of the Nri people over wide areas of Igboland.\nIn the economic sphere also, the disruption to normal agricultural activities must have been considerable. In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars.

These changes naturally affected, in turn, the culture of these three areas, and contributed to a sharper distinction and discrimination of each region's peculiar culture. 48 Part of this reality, of course, was the bewildering variation in the situation in which an arriving African could find himself. In the Caribbean, the Africans formed the majority of the population. The phenotype was self-evidently black. In the USA on the other hand, black phenotypes were a minority of the national population, however concentrated they might have been in some individual states. In parts of Latin America such as Ecuador, Chile and Argentina, the blacks had virtually disappeared genetically among the American Indian and European groups, illustrating a broad spectrum of biological intermixture. 49 Nor did the demographic evolution of the regions follow the logical pattern of relative participation in the trans-Atlantic slave trade.

These facilitated, partly caused, and were also in part the result of the changes we have noted above in the political structures and military systems. More than that, there was a growing demand for labour outside the customary bounds of the household unit, the village community or age grade associations. While the various societies remained resistant to freemen selling their labour, the predominant tendency in the nineteenth century was towards expansion of the scale of slave labour, an increase in the areas in which enforced labour was used, and a greater use of migrant labour. The general trend in the third quarter of the nineteenth century was for increased slaveholding in general, even in rural areas, an increase in the number of slaves held within each household, and an increase in the use of slaves in production under quasi-capitalist conditions, thus making their lives harsher than ever before. 18 With the intensification of political rivalries from the very beginning of the century, it became usual to press disputes over land, cattle, and even doctrinal differences to the point of completely destroying the enemy as an identifiable entity. Whole communities were incorporated into existing polities or dispersed and the bulk of the young men and women taken away as captives. Such captives were used to satisfy the increasing demand for labour in agriculture, craft production and mining and also as warriors in the emerging professional armies. The new state structures and military systems diminished the importance of the old aristocracies, whose members had depended on the accumulation of wives and extended families for their social, economic and political support, but they also created new bureaucratic groups that needed to be freed from normal agricultural duties. These new aristocracies depended not on large kinship groups as such, but on large households of clients and captives who maintained increasingly large farms to provision the household as well as groups of warriors at the battlefront. They were also deployed to produce goods for the local markets and for long-distance trade, so as to acquire the wealth necessary to attract more clients and buy imported arms and ammunition.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The new changes resulted from a combination of factors, including the nineteenth-century wars which, as in Yorubaland, had the effect of ren› dering the coastal areas relatively safe and attractive to migration from the hinterlands in which most of the fighting took place; the sea-borne trade which was rendered permanent by the transition from slave to 'legitimate' trade, thereby conferring a definite economic advantage on the coastal regions; and the steady growth of European interest, which enlarged the traditional role of selected coastal towns such as Lagos, Porto Novo and eventually Cotonou to take on new and increasing responsibilities not only as ports but also as political capitals of emergent colonial states and their independent African successors.\nIn all these changes, however, the economic factor would appear to have been the most dominant, especially with reference to the European presence. Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

The institutions of slavery slowly crumbled from within and without. The curious combination of political freedom which gave white Americans a greater voice in their internal affairs, economic selfinterest, humanitarianism, imperial incompatibility, and the unquenchable thirst for liberty on the part of the enslaved, ultimately destroyed the American slave system.$^{44}$ The political independence of the USA after 1776, Haiti after 1804, the mainland Spanish colonies after 1825, and Brazil after 1822, gave a different complexion to the political dimension of the system of slavery and the slave trade, and had repercussions outside the parochial boundaries of each empire, colony and state.\nThe loss of the British North American colonies in 1783 and the termination of the British slave trade in 1808 affected slavery and the African in profound ways. The largest and most efficient supplier removed itself from the market, and began an intensive campaign to persuade other European states to follow its example. The British anti-slavery campaign sharply reduced the number of Africans taken to the Americas during the nineteenth century, although the total remains high. Before the trade ended in 1870, the pattern returned to that which prevailed during its first century.$^{45}$ The Spanish and Portuguese colonies again became the major importers.

Their learned observation endorses the popular view. But the proposition needs explanation. Humanitarianism is a Western ideology, and it is unlikely to have found any place in the minds of African distributors of the time - with very rare exceptions. But this does not mean that they were constitutionally incapable of giving up the trade, as Western supporters of slavery maintained. The continuance of the supply of exportable manpower from Africa can be logically explained in economic terms. That the distributors were black and the exporters white is irrelevant: it was a paying proposition, profitable to both trading partners, whose sole object was to make money. That was the situation at the grass roots. The continuance of the supply is to be explained in terms of the efficient working of an integrated system: and what Africans were resisting was the disruption of this system. For one thing, it would have ruined the established business of the distributors,$^{31}$ who had no other prospects, to say nothing of the chain of repercussions it would have set off on the social and political structure, both locally and further afield. In other words, so long as the barter system between the hinterland and the coast, and the coast's foreign trade, had no clear alternative to the slave trade, opposition by African slave-traders to its suppression was dictated strictly by the imperative needs to avoid commercial chaos.$^{32}$ The supposed complicity of the African distributors was no more than a reflex reaction to the immediate economic situation. This also explains the fall in the selling price of exportable manpower: it was the market's defence against growing pressure from the forces of suppression. The latter thus helped to contribute to an unsatisfactory situation. This argument needs to be modi› fied when the exportation of Africans to the north or east is considered. While the economic interests of the slave hunters and distributors are selfevident in this case too, it is hard to see what kind of economic compensa› tion accrued to the countries that were plundered.

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'African reactions', 'content': ""Between 1787 and 1807, i.e. in the period immediately preceding abolition by the West, more than a million Africans were transported to the Americas.

Indecisiveness by the abolitionists left Portugal and Brazil to carry on the illicit trade south of the Equator at their leisure, and exportation was sometimes as high as in the eighteenth century. Though seriously combated after 1842, the trade did not die out on the Loango Coast until the end of the century.$^{24}$ North of the Equator, extension of the abolition order to the European settlements brought about the closure of traditional trading centres in Senegambia, Sierra Leone, Liberia and the Gold Coast.

Within the continent there was still domestic slavery, as was evidenced by the 1904 report on French West Africa which showed almost a quarter of the population in some type of bondage,$^{32}$ but the demographic impact was probably slight. Although by 1880 the Atlantic trade was four centuries old, half the slaving had occurred since about 1770, first in response to the American cotton boom and then to the growing demands from Brazil.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'Much the same doubts could be cast on another of the trade goods, guns.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well. In the 1840s the impact of such measures in Algiers was particularly great as the French strove to control cholera. 47', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Social and economic transformation', 'content': 'With the effective end of the Atlantic slave trade and the increased demand for gold, palm oil, palm kernels and peanuts from western Africa, sugar cane from Mauritius, RØunion and the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean, as well as ivory and cloves from East and Central Africa, there was an increased demand for captives not only to produce these goods, but also to transport them by headload or by canoes down to the coast. Plantation slavery emerged, either in the form of slave settlements in the rural areas managed according to customary law on the Guinea coast, or Islamic law in the Muslim areas, or approximating to American-type plantations in the Indian Ocean islands. With the increased use of people of slave origin as warriors and in administrative positions at various courts, it has been estimated that in many parts of Africa slave populations could range between 25 and 50 per cent of the total population.$^{19}$ Although there were examples of slave revolts, and the particular example of the Lozi who threw off their Kololo overlords,$^{20}$ generally the slave populations did not form a distinct class. The bulk performed menial jobs, largely as agricultural labourers. However the substantial groups of warriors and domestic slaves, and the significant few who rose to positions of trust and power as successful warriors, traders or administrators, and the variations in their fortunes and life styles, made combination as a class of slaves very difficult. Only in places like Old Calabar, where the slaves were permanently alienated, with little inclination to integrate them culturally, and with a tradition of competition among the ruling elite to show off wealth by the number of slaves killed in funeral ceremonies,$^{21}$ did the slaves in the agricultural villages combine in a secret cult to demand improved conditions. Elsewhere, the prevalent ethos was acculturation and integration into the society through individual households. While the degree of integration was clearly limited - as witnessed by the number anxious to be redeemed or, having been emancipated by colonial laws, who were anxious to return to their original homes - it was real enough to suggest that the dynamics of change in most of the African communities was the tension of age and sex within each household, and of status and competition for power between the lineages and kinship groups, rather than between broad classes in society.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.712, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The impact of Africa', 'content': 'When the American slave systems disintegrated during the nineteenth century, the basic institutional forms and social attitudes of the societies had already been established.

In some cases, the influences from Africa were strong enough and pervasive enough to forge a genuine Afro-American culture competing with, and sometimes complementing the Europeanderived culture.\nIn the USA the political-structure imposed a rigid dichotomy between black and white in the population, relegating any individual with any degree of African ancestry to the category of black.$^{51}$ By contrast, throughout the rest of the hemisphere a three-tiered social categorization prevailed, corres› ponding to the dominant groups of black, mixed, and white.

For the sake of a few paltry hundreds a-year, this country, which is spending half-a-million annually on the naval squadron for suppressing the slave-trade, delivers over the people of an extensive region to this monster enormity. We called attention, some twelve months ago, to the active operations of the slavetraders at Quittah, since the virtual abandonment of that place by the British authorities. We stated then that many hundred slaves, from Ashantee and the Volta districts, had passed Quittah by the Lagoons and sea coast for shipment, at a place nearer to the King of Dahomey\'s port of Whydah, which our readers will see in our Dahoman news the King calls ""the English town of Whydah."" And now it seems that so far from anything having been done by the British Government to put an end to such practices, the trade has gone on constantly increasing, until it has destroyed the legitimate commerce which before existed, and which ought to have been fostered with the extremest assiduity and care.

We have by it become really implicated as a nation in that slave-trade which we are, at the same time, making such expensive efforts to suppress. The proper re-occupation of Addah and Quittah would destroy the slave-trade up the Volta, and limit it on the coast to the Dahoman territory, until by negotiation, or other means, we can effect its discontinuance there, and thus purge the whole Bight of Benin of this accursed atrocity.', 'last_edit_date': '1862-11-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_11_1862#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.608, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The frightful condition in which the slaves are landed from the captured slavers at Sierra Leone is vividly depicted:—\n\n""At the period I took charge of the Kissy Hospitals (1837) the slave-trade was in active operation, consequently great numbers of liberated Africans were constantly received into hospital. It was a most distressing sight to witness the arrival of these poor creatures; and it is necessary to make a few preliminary remarks in order clearly to understand the difficulties with which the medical officers had to contend. The appearance of the slaves when landed was most striking. In some the expression of the countenance indicated sufferings, moral and physical, of the most profound and agonising nature. Others of them gazed vacantly around them in the most utter helplessness. Occasionally, among the newly-arrived groups all sense of suffering was merged in melancholic or raving madness. The wizened, shrunk, and skinny features were lighted up by the hollow, feverish eye. The belly was, as it were, tacked to the back, whilst the hip-bones protruded, and, in some cases, became the seat of foul, sloughing ulcers. The hand and skinny fingers seemed much elongated by the great and neglected growth of the nails, and they were so deplorably emaciated, that the skin appeared tensely stretched over, and tied down to the skeleton. The legs refused to perform their functions, and they reeled and tottered about from sheer debility. Their squalor and extreme wretchedness was heightened, in many cases, by the particoloured evacuations with which their bodies were besmeared. When large numbers of the sick were suffering from dysentery, the condition of the wards and yards in the morning was extremely loathsome. This was in a great degree unavoidable, as the sick were too weak to crawl from their mats to the commode, although everything was done under the surgeons\' orders to keep the wards as clean and wholesome as the crowded state of the hospital would admit of."" In a word, ""the moral and physical causes of depression were often so overwhelming, and so intensely concentrated, that the combination produced disease in such formidable shapes as to be beyond remedy. The mortality was consequently very great; many persons brought to the hospital in the last stage of disease died a few hours after their arrival; others even expired by the way.

This trade, once inaugurated, was carried on by the Egyptians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and Europeans down to the end of the last century, when the revival of human feeling urged certain philanthropists in England to move towards the abolition of a great evil. But during all this period the negro himself was as much to blame as the white and yellow men; indeed, it was probable that negroes were enslaving negroes long before Egyptian or Arab bought black servants from the negro chiefs, and at the present day there would be no slavery in Africa if an approval of slavery were not present in the philosophy of the negro tribes of Africa. Slavery and the slave trade, with the tribal wars and their attendant insecurity, had been the cause of Africa's backward condition, and if ever that Continent were to be raised to the civilisation of Europe, slavery and the slave trade must be extirpated. The two great slave markets which, until a few years ago, had existed in America, and in Turkey and Persia rendered the inducements to slave traders so great that the guarding of the coasts of Africa by British cruisers only checked the trade in a very slight degree; and even now many slaves were sent to Arabia, Persia, and Madagascar. In the present day, however, Africa was the main consumer of its own slaves. The most remarkable revival of the slave trade and occurred in German East Africa. The Germans, under Major Von Wissmann, began by suppressing a revolt of the Arab slave dealers, which led to the almost complete extinction of the oversea slave traffic on the German coast of East Africa; but the organisation of a strong government led to the rapid settling down of the Arabs as great landed proprietors, with an unlimited number of slaves to work their plantations. Legally slavery could not exist in German territory, but in such a wide and sparsely populated region it was impossible to prevent it in fact; and as the slaves were ordinarily well and kindly treated, it never occurred to them to want to leave their masters or to better their condition. It might be asked where, then, was the harm of slavery? The harm lay in this, that slavery commenced with an initial evil. The speaker then drew a picture of the loss of life, devastation of countries, and breaking of family ties which attended a capture of slaves. This depopulation of whole regions was attended with another evil, the return of the dreaded tsetse fly; and the surest way of extirpating this pest was to encourage population in the fertile districts of Central Africa.

Rua, a very large section of country north and west of Cazembe\'s, but still in the same inland region, is peopled by men very like those of Insama and Cazembe. An Arab, Syde Bin Habib, went to trade in Rua two years ago, and as the Arabs usually do where the natives have no guns, Syde Bin Habib\'s elder brother carried matters with a high hand. The Rua men observed that the elder brother slept in a white tent, and, pitching their spears into it by night, killed him. As Moslems never forgive bloodshed, the younger brother forthwith ran amuck on all indiscriminately in a large district. Let it not be supposed that any of these people are like the American Indians—insatiable, bloodthirsty savages, who will not be reclaimed or enter into terms of lasting friendship with fair-dealing strangers. Had the actual murderers been demanded, and a little time been granted, I feel morally certain, from many other instances among tribes who, like the Ba Rua, have not been spoiled by Arab traders, they would all have been given up. The chiefs of the country would, first of all, have specified the crime of which the elder brother was guilty, and who had been led to avenge it. It is very likely that they would stipulate that no other should be punished but the actual perpetrator. Domestic slaves acting under his orders would be considered free from blame. I know of nothing that distinguishes the uncontaminated Africans from other degraded peoples more than their entire reasonableness and good sense. It is different after they have had wives, children, and relatives kidnapped; but that is more than human nature, civilised or savage, can bear. In the case in question indiscriminate slaughter, capture, and plunder took place. A very large number of very fine young men were captured and secured in chains and wooden yokes. I came near the party of Syde Bin Habib, close to the point where a rent in the mountains of Rua allows the escape of the great river Lualaba out of Lake Moero. And here I had for the first time an opportunity of observing the difference between slaves and freemen made captives. When fairly across Lualaba Syde thought his captives safe, and got rid of the trouble of attending to and watching the chained gangs by taking off both chains and yokes. All declared their joy, and perfect willingness to follow Syde to the end of the world or elsewhere, but next morning twenty-two made clear off to the mountains. Many more, on seeing the broad Lualaba roll between them and the homes of their infancy, lost all heart, and in three days eight of them died. The had no complaint but pain in the heart, and they pointed out its seat correctly; though many believe that the heart is situated underneath the top of the sternum or breast-bone. This to me was the most startling death I ever saw. They evidently died of broken-heartedness, and the Arabs wondered, \'seeing they had plenty to eat.\' I saw the others perish, particularly a very fine boy of ten or twelve years of age. When asked if he felt ill he put his hand correctly and exactly over the heart. He was kindly carried, and as he breathed out his soul was laid gently on the side of the path. The captors were not unusually cruel. They were callous—slaving had hardened their hearts. When Syde, who was an old friend of mine, crossed the Lualaba, he heard that I was in a village where a company of slave traders had been furiously assaulted for three days by justly-incensed Babeemba. I would not fight nor allow my people to fire if I saw them, because the Babeemba had been especially kind to me. Syde sent a party of his own people to invite me to leave the village by night, and come to him. He showed himself the opposite of hard-hearted; but slaving \'hardens all within, and petrifies the feelings.\' It is hard for the victims, and for the victimisers.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1872#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.608, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICAN PROSPECTS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'And now Portugal must—must put an end to the slave-trade from her East African possessions—or if she is unable to do so must be constrained to withdraw from the scene and allow some one else to do it for her.

L. Cameron, R.N., C.B. The Earl of Dundonald was in the chair.\n\nCommander Lovett Cameron, in the course of his opening remarks, said the slave trade went on all round the continent of Africa, and commerce had gone on with it. Our trade with the West Coast of Africa had gone on since the time of the Tudors. For centuries that trade was in slaves, and its increase was slow; but after several blows had been struck at that trade—among others by the liberation of slaves in the West Indian Islands, in America, and in Cuba—instead of their being any injury done to our commerce, our trade with the West Coast of Africa increased by leaps and bounds. It was only in 1850 or shortly after that we attacked a great nest of slave dealers in Lagos, and in 1861 it was made a British colony. Up to that time there had been no trade there except in slaves; but last year the trade of Lagos amounted to £357,831 imports, and £538,980 exports. And yet only thirty-eight years ago that place was of absolutely no value to us for legitimate commerce. On the Gold Coast slavery had been practically abolished by the British Government, but yet there was a good deal still existing owing to the native customs of the people. Even if the export of slaves from Africa was prevented entirely, the internal trade in them would still be enormous.\n\nFormerly the slave trade was subsidiary to the ivory trade, but when porters were no longer wanted for the latter, the former remained, only the men were killed and the women and children carried away. It had been said that domestic slavery must be allowed, and that was a very difficult question to settle. In his opinion, we should, as in India, abolish the legal status of slavery, but should not rout out all the households where no complaint was made. As long as domestic slavery existed there would be a market for slaves. We must have nothing to do with slavery; while the slave trade continued it was impossible for legitimate commerce to go on as it should! If the slave trade were done away with, they would find that all other trade would flourish.\n\nIn answer to questions Commander Lovett Cameron said he had avoided speaking of the Germans for diplomatic reasons.\n\nHe had a plan for the total abolition of slavery in Africa, which he hoped to explain shortly. It was, in brief, to establish a barricade across the country by the way of the lakes, and to get authority to maintain order on that line.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, on February 26, presided over a large meeting, held in Exeter Hall, when two African explorers, Commander Cameron and Captain Hore, were announced to speak.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-03-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_03_1889#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.615, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Slave Trade in Africa in 1872', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Iniquitous commerce and the residence of the contractors.

This pamphlet throws a strong light upon a matter of which, perhaps, most people, even of those specially interested in the regeneration of Africa, have heard but little. The evidence now brought together goes to prove that in certain parts the wages of native labourers are paid, even in the case of mere boys and girls, in spirits, and that as a result, in some places, after the first hour or so, labour is unprocurable on account of the drunkenness of the people. ""The idea of drinking spirits is inseparable from the notion of European life in the ken of the natives. Owing to the relaxing climate of the rivers, there are few factories which cannot tell their tale of hard drinking and certain death as a consequence. But we are repeating an oft-told story, and those who read these pages have probably made themselves acquainted with the state of the West Coast in some degree. ... Competition is relentless; times are very bad; palm oil has fallen to a ruinous rate. But the degradation of the tribes of West Africa has reached a depth which is appalling."" Few men are more fitted to testify concerning the extent to which liquor trafficking with the native races of Africa has reached than Mr. Jas. Irvine, of Liverpool; and the following extract from a communication from him speaks volumes: ""It is very difficult to give you an account of the ramifications of the drink traffic on the West Coast of Africa—not because there is little to be said, but because it is only a repetition of the oft-told story in every part of the world. The extent of the trade is so prodigious that I think the following estimate of the quantity annually poured into the delta of the Niger relieves me from the necessity of further remark concerning this evil. ... I am sure I do not over-estimate the quantity when I put it down at 60,000 hogsheads of 50 gallons each as the annual consumption in the rivers."" We have in the native African one whose natural character is so weak that he easily becomes a victim when a dead set is made at him by those who are able to influence him. One needs go no further than the store-house of the first West African factory to know what is the native\'s weak point, and the form of the attack made upon it. His propensity to strong drink has been pandered to until things could hardly be worse with him. Mr. Joseph Thomson, the eminent African traveller, recently laid before the members of the Manchester Geographical Society his views upon this subject, and which fully support what has been already said: ""In the notorious gin trade lies a greater evil even than slavery. It is indeed a scandal and a shame. ... We talk of civilizing the negro and introducing the blessings of European trade, while at the same time we pour into this unhappy country incredible quantities of gin, rum, gunpowder, and guns. ... The trade in spirits is simply enormous. The appetite for it increases out of all proportion to the desire for better things; and, to our shame be it said, we are ever ready to supply the victims to the utmost, driving them deeper and deeper into the slough of depravity, while at home we talk sanctimoniously as if the introduction of our trade and the elevation of the negro went hand in hand.""

The text suggests that the abolition of the slave trade shifted income distribution from the ruling elite to ordinary people, indicating that legitimate trade could have been more beneficial for Africa's development, though the lack of technological advancements limited Africa's competitiveness with industrialized economies. Similarly, The African Times articles underscore how Africa's rich resources were overshadowed by the demand for slaves, keeping the continent poor despite its potential for legitimate trade. The articles attribute Africa's backward condition to the slave trade, which incited tribal wars and insecurity, and destroyed existing legitimate commerce.

First, the manner in which slaves were procured tended to destroy social and political structures. Social outcasts, offenders against the law, were sold into slavery. A few persons were sold in times of famine or for debt. But the majority of slaves were apparently taken by kidnapping, raiding and wars. The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda. Accordingly, the extensive influence exercised by the Aro over Igboland through its oracle did not become an integrative force.$^{9}$ The element of violence inherent in Aro addiction to the slave trade thus distinguished their influence from the earlier ritual influ› ence of the Nri people over wide areas of Igboland.\nIn the economic sphere also, the disruption to normal agricultural activities must have been considerable. In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars. The metal bars were turned into pewters, ritual bells, state swords, leg-rings, and other ornaments.

Similarly, Nguni dynamism was premised upon their ability to incorporate and extract surplus from their large pool of captives. 51 Allowing for local variations, a broad pattern of economic dislocation resulting from the slave trade is nevertheless discernible. The violent disruption of much of the rural economy, the export of many of the most productive members of the indigenous societies, the inadvertent introduction of highly contagious diseases, and the growing dependence of the Central African economy on the world trading system intensified the process of underdevelopment. It is true that this process was accompanied by the dissemination of new crops such as tobacco, maize, rice and cassava, the introduction of modest technological innovations like the Chikunda traps, granaries, and weapons, and the expansion of some local industry. But these were relatively insignificant developments when placed in juxtaposition to the economic retardation of the region as a whole. 52 Little needs to be said about the unprecedented level of destruction that While slavery had been a feature of many Central African societies before the slave trade, preliminary evidence suggests a growing tendency to acquire captives to extract surplus which the aristocracy used to maintain its privileged position.

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': 'Viewed from a somewhat different perspective, the unequal value of commodities exchanged reflects the fragile position of the region within the larger international trading system. As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts. The extent to which popular discontent surfaced more frequently during the second half of the century suggests growing class antagonisms as did slave uprisings in Lozi society and on the prazos.""\nIn other instances trading interests, independent of the rulers, were able to dominate commerce and undercut the position of the political authorities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': ""Ironically, those rulers and merchants engaged in the quest for additional captives occasionally became victims of the political and social upheavals generated by the slave trade.

Faced with a diminished labour pool the Makua rulers began raiding each other and enslaving their own subjects in order to maintain the profitable slave trade on which they had become totally dependent. Within two decades the Makua were badly fragmented, leaving them easy prey to subsequent Portuguese invasions.$^{47}$ The AfroPortuguese prazero community exhibited a similar myopic desire for profits which precipitated the rapid demise of the prazo system. As in the case of the Makua chiefs, the prazeros violated their historic charter and began to enslave people living on their lands when they could no longer acquire captives from the interior. In reaction to these excesses the indigenous population either revolted and drove the prazeros off the land or fled into the interior, depriving the estate owner of his traditional source of tribute. The effect, in either case, was the destruction of most prazos by 1830, and those that managed to survive suffered from recurring famines that so debilitated the indigenous population that they proved no match for the attacks of the subsequent decades. Fifty years later the Gwemba, Nsenga and Tawara rose up against their mestizo (Afro-Portuguese and Afro-Asian) and Chikunda overlords who had been enslaving them and exporting them to the coast.$^{48}$ } '' The Shona-dominated region, stretching from the southern margins of the Zambezi to the Inhambane hinterland, becariie a secondary source of slaves, as did the Delagoa Bay area to the south. Within this broad zone there were only small pockets of alien commercial penetration, most notably Chikunda conquests along the southern margins of the Zambezi river, and occasional forays by Portuguese and African traders linked to commercial interests at the ports of Inhambane and Lourenço Marques (present-day Maputo).

The slave trade was of course a product of, and a key element in, the construction of the European-centred capitalist world-economy that had come into existence c. 1450. By the seventeenth century this capitalist world-economy included as part of its peripheral production areas the 'extended' Caribbean zone of the Americas. In this zone, the expanding plantation systems (especially sugar, but also tobacco, cotton, and other products) came to depend increasingly for their manpower on slaves who were 'captured' in West and Central Africa and transported across the Atlantic.\nShould this long-distance trade in slaves be classified as 'luxury' trade or as trade in 'essentials'? Can it be said to have involved the 'production' of manpower for the capitalist world-economy? And should therefore the 'producing' zones be seen as peripheral areas of this capitalist worldeconomy? There is no simple answer to these queries. In terms of numbers exported there was an upward curve in the slave trade from 1450 to 1800, with a significant increase c. 1650.

Their learned observation endorses the popular view. But the proposition needs explanation. Humanitarianism is a Western ideology, and it is unlikely to have found any place in the minds of African distributors of the time - with very rare exceptions. But this does not mean that they were constitutionally incapable of giving up the trade, as Western supporters of slavery maintained. The continuance of the supply of exportable manpower from Africa can be logically explained in economic terms. That the distributors were black and the exporters white is irrelevant: it was a paying proposition, profitable to both trading partners, whose sole object was to make money. That was the situation at the grass roots. The continuance of the supply is to be explained in terms of the efficient working of an integrated system: and what Africans were resisting was the disruption of this system. For one thing, it would have ruined the established business of the distributors,$^{31}$ who had no other prospects, to say nothing of the chain of repercussions it would have set off on the social and political structure, both locally and further afield. In other words, so long as the barter system between the hinterland and the coast, and the coast's foreign trade, had no clear alternative to the slave trade, opposition by African slave-traders to its suppression was dictated strictly by the imperative needs to avoid commercial chaos.$^{32}$ The supposed complicity of the African distributors was no more than a reflex reaction to the immediate economic situation. This also explains the fall in the selling price of exportable manpower: it was the market's defence against growing pressure from the forces of suppression. The latter thus helped to contribute to an unsatisfactory situation. This argument needs to be modi› fied when the exportation of Africans to the north or east is considered. While the economic interests of the slave hunters and distributors are selfevident in this case too, it is hard to see what kind of economic compensa› tion accrued to the countries that were plundered.

The main sources of supply, however, were not only the great djihäd conducted by the Muslim leaders of the north and the conflicts in Mossi territory. The trade was also fed from a host of channels that sluiced off slaves from peoples belonging to hundreds of chieftaincies, from the territories of the Tuareg to the areas bordering the trading posts on the coast. During the final decades of the nineteenth century, war broke out in virtually every decade and in virtually every region, and war meant captives. These victims were for the most part from sedentary agricultural communities, which served as a veritable breeding stock for the trade. Hence the underpopulated areas to be found in regions that were literally drained of their inhabitants. Tribute exacted in the form of captives was extremely heavy in many instances.

The more fortunate regions had quite a different appearance from the others: arms, textiles and domestic slaves were plentiful there and rare elsewhere. As we shall see, during periods of economic recession the Portuguese tried to monopolize the profits of the network by eliminating African 'middlemen', whereas during periods of economic growth most of the trade in the interior was carried on by Africans.\nDuring the nineteenth century, the network had to adapt to certain major trade cycles. Up to the 1840s the slave trade was by far the most important Portuguese-African activity. This last peak period was in fact the most disastrous in the history of the Angolan slave trade. It is estimated that from 1780 to 1830, between 15000 and 20000 slaves were exported annually from Central African ports (from the Loango coast to the south of Angola). Brazil was the main importer and Angola the principal supplier. It was Angolan slave labour that made it possible to expand the coffee- plantation economy of Rio de Janeiro and Sào Paulo in the nineteenth century.

While the degree of integration was clearly limited - as witnessed by the number anxious to be redeemed or, having been emancipated by colonial laws, who were anxious to return to their original homes - it was real enough to suggest that the dynamics of change in most of the African communities was the tension of age and sex within each household, and of status and competition for power between the lineages and kinship groups, rather than between broad classes in society.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.612, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Abolitionist ideology was not African in inspiration.

This trade, once inaugurated, was carried on by the Egyptians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and Europeans down to the end of the last century, when the revival of human feeling urged certain philanthropists in England to move towards the abolition of a great evil. But during all this period the negro himself was as much to blame as the white and yellow men; indeed, it was probable that negroes were enslaving negroes long before Egyptian or Arab bought black servants from the negro chiefs, and at the present day there would be no slavery in Africa if an approval of slavery were not present in the philosophy of the negro tribes of Africa. Slavery and the slave trade, with the tribal wars and their attendant insecurity, had been the cause of Africa's backward condition, and if ever that Continent were to be raised to the civilisation of Europe, slavery and the slave trade must be extirpated. The two great slave markets which, until a few years ago, had existed in America, and in Turkey and Persia rendered the inducements to slave traders so great that the guarding of the coasts of Africa by British cruisers only checked the trade in a very slight degree; and even now many slaves were sent to Arabia, Persia, and Madagascar. In the present day, however, Africa was the main consumer of its own slaves. The most remarkable revival of the slave trade and occurred in German East Africa. The Germans, under Major Von Wissmann, began by suppressing a revolt of the Arab slave dealers, which led to the almost complete extinction of the oversea slave traffic on the German coast of East Africa; but the organisation of a strong government led to the rapid settling down of the Arabs as great landed proprietors, with an unlimited number of slaves to work their plantations. Legally slavery could not exist in German territory, but in such a wide and sparsely populated region it was impossible to prevent it in fact; and as the slaves were ordinarily well and kindly treated, it never occurred to them to want to leave their masters or to better their condition. It might be asked where, then, was the harm of slavery? The harm lay in this, that slavery commenced with an initial evil. The speaker then drew a picture of the loss of life, devastation of countries, and breaking of family ties which attended a capture of slaves. This depopulation of whole regions was attended with another evil, the return of the dreaded tsetse fly; and the surest way of extirpating this pest was to encourage population in the fertile districts of Central Africa.

But where, he asked, was the compensation to Africa for the frightful legacy of crime and degradation they had left behind? Where was the reparation and atonement for the millions torn from their homes and the millions massacred, for a land laid waste, for the further warping of the rudimentary moral ideas of myriads of people, and the driving of them into ten-fold lower depths of savagery than they had known before the European era?

This privileged land is the theatre of slavery, and the home of the man-hunter. The large city of Kouka, in the vicinity of Lake Tchad, the capital of Bornou, is one of the greatest marts for this human merchandise.\n\nOn the Square, the best adapted for the slave-markets, one is sure every day to find several hundreds; but on Monday, the great sale day, they may be numbered by thousands; the blacks are there exhibited in their pitiable plight, partially covered with miserable tatters.

It has been now for some time notorious that there are only two localities on the Coast where these slave embarkations take place to any extent. These are the fifty miles of coast between Quittah and Whydah, and the neighbourhood of the River Congo. We are ashamed to enumerate the ships ostensibly paid by this country for preventing these embarkations. We say ostensibly, because, after having condemned the assertion by others for many years, ""that all our Admiralty desire is to repress, not destroy,"" we begin reluctantly to entertain the same belief. No reasonable man can doubt that, with such officers and vessels as England can send out, with the money so ungrudgingly voted year by year for the slave squadron, the slave-trade from those localities could be entirely prevented. Why, then, is it not prevented? The reputation of our navy is at stake. If there be anything in the Admiralty orders that impedes or misdirects the efforts of the squadron, we ought to know what it is. Until we do, the squadron must consent to share the disgrace with the Admiralty.

Nobody has any sympathy with that scum of humanity thus engaged in the slave-trade. They deserve no consideration. They are a reproach to human nature—they are an outrage to the Christian world. If certain international considerations prevent stringing them all up at the yard-arm, as such wholesale murderers, with atrocious cruelty, for gain, so richly merit, we think that at least they might be stripped, tarred, and feathered, and set on shore, if possible, in the immediate locality of the place at which they had taken in their wretched cargo—or at any other point of the African coast at which the capture may be made. Then leave them to the justice of God. If they escape, we doubt their ever again becoming slavedrivers. If they perish, their blood be upon their own heads.

This trade, once inaugurated, was carried on by the Egyptians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and Europeans down to the end of the last century, when the revival of human feeling urged certain philanthropists in England to move towards the abolition of a great evil. But during all this period the negro himself was as much to blame as the white and yellow men; indeed, it was probable that negroes were enslaving negroes long before Egyptian or Arab bought black servants from the negro chiefs, and at the present day there would be no slavery in Africa if an approval of slavery were not present in the philosophy of the negro tribes of Africa. Slavery and the slave trade, with the tribal wars and their attendant insecurity, had been the cause of Africa's backward condition, and if ever that Continent were to be raised to the civilisation of Europe, slavery and the slave trade must be extirpated. The two great slave markets which, until a few years ago, had existed in America, and in Turkey and Persia rendered the inducements to slave traders so great that the guarding of the coasts of Africa by British cruisers only checked the trade in a very slight degree; and even now many slaves were sent to Arabia, Persia, and Madagascar. In the present day, however, Africa was the main consumer of its own slaves. The most remarkable revival of the slave trade and occurred in German East Africa. The Germans, under Major Von Wissmann, began by suppressing a revolt of the Arab slave dealers, which led to the almost complete extinction of the oversea slave traffic on the German coast of East Africa; but the organisation of a strong government led to the rapid settling down of the Arabs as great landed proprietors, with an unlimited number of slaves to work their plantations. Legally slavery could not exist in German territory, but in such a wide and sparsely populated region it was impossible to prevent it in fact; and as the slaves were ordinarily well and kindly treated, it never occurred to them to want to leave their masters or to better their condition. It might be asked where, then, was the harm of slavery? The harm lay in this, that slavery commenced with an initial evil. The speaker then drew a picture of the loss of life, devastation of countries, and breaking of family ties which attended a capture of slaves. This depopulation of whole regions was attended with another evil, the return of the dreaded tsetse fly; and the surest way of extirpating this pest was to encourage population in the fertile districts of Central Africa.

649,Financial incentives for local rulers like the Sultan of Zanzibar both perpetuated the slave trade and facilitated British collaboration to suppress it.,"The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the claim that financial incentives for local rulers like the Sultan of Zanzibar both perpetuated the slave trade and facilitated British collaboration to suppress it. The General History of Africa highlights the Sultan's economic dependency on the slave trade due to the expanding plantation economy in Zanzibar and Pemba, which relied heavily on slave labor. This economic reliance made it challenging for the Sultan to halt the trade, supporting the notion that financial incentives perpetuated it. However, the textbook also points out the inadequacies in British suppression efforts, such as ineffective enforcement of decrees and persistent smuggling, suggesting that collaboration was not as effective as the claim implies. Notably, the text does not emphasize financial incentives as a factor in British collaboration, focusing instead on political and humanitarian motivations. In contrast, The African Times articles suggest that the Sultan benefited financially from the slave trade through mechanisms like a head tax on slaves, reinforcing the idea of financial incentives perpetuating the trade. The articles also detail British proposals to financially compensate the Sultan to cease slave trading, including an offer of £8,000 annually and the signing of a treaty to close the slave market, illustrating British attempts to use financial means to suppress the trade. Together, these sources reveal a complex interplay where financial incentives both sustained the slave trade and were employed by the British as a strategy to facilitate its suppression, partially supporting the claim while also highlighting the challenges and strategies involved.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several insights that both support and refute the claim regarding financial incentives for local rulers like the Sultan of Zanzibar in perpetuating the slave trade and facilitating British collaboration to suppress it. The text highlights that the Sultan of Zanzibar's economic interests were deeply tied to the slave trade due to the expanding plantation economy in Zanzibar and Pemba, which relied heavily on slave labor. This economic dependency made it difficult for the Sultan to agree to stop the slave trade, as it would limit the growth of the plantation economy. This supports the claim that financial incentives perpetuated the slave trade. However, the text also indicates that British efforts to suppress the trade were often inadequate and faced significant challenges, such as the inability to enforce decrees effectively and the persistence of slave trading through smuggling and concealed stations. While the British did engage in treaties and naval patrols to curb the trade, these efforts were not always successful, suggesting that collaboration was not as effective as the claim might imply. Additionally, the text does not explicitly mention financial incentives as a factor in British collaboration, focusing more on political and humanitarian motivations. This absence of direct financial incentives for British collaboration is a notable difference from the claim. Overall, the text provides a nuanced view that aligns partially with the claim but also highlights complexities and challenges in the suppression efforts.","The African Times news articles provide several details that both support and refute the claim regarding financial incentives for local rulers like the Sultan of Zanzibar in relation to the slave trade. The articles suggest that the Sultan of Zanzibar received financial benefits from the slave trade, such as a head tax on slaves sold in the Zanzibar market, which perpetuated the trade. This aligns with the claim that financial incentives for local rulers contributed to the continuation of the slave trade. However, the articles also highlight British efforts to suppress the trade, including proposals to compensate the Sultan to cease slave trading activities, indicating a financial collaboration to end the trade. The suggestion to pay the Sultan £8,000 annually to stop the slave trade and the eventual signing of a treaty to close the slave market further illustrate British attempts to use financial incentives to suppress the trade. These details show a complex relationship where financial incentives both perpetuated and facilitated efforts to suppress the slave trade, supporting the claim in part while also highlighting the British strategy of using financial means to achieve abolition.",True,649,Slave Trade,Economic and Societal Impact of the Slave Trade,"[{'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Increased European pressures', 'content': ""Why was it so difficult to get the sultan of Zanzibar to agree to stop the slave trade? The answer is obvious if one bears in mind the nature of the expanding plantation economy in Zanzibar and Pemba. Its dependence on slave labour meant that restriction on the procurement of slaves would limit its growth. It is known that plantation agriculture continued to expand after the decree of 1873.$^{49}$ As slave-trading was still legal on the mainland coast, traders were able to transport slaves a long distance along the coast between Kilwa and Mombasa or even Malindi and smuggle them to Zanzibar, and especially Pemba, in small vessels at night in order to avoid the British naval patrol. Even after the slave trade was prohibited on the mainland in 1876, neither the sultan nor the British were in a position to enforce the decree effectively. The clove plantations on the islands had increased demand for food production on the mainland coast, especially grain. Thus, a number of plantations producing grain with slave labour had sprung up all along the coast between Pangani and Malindi. It was therefore impossible during this time to distinguish slaves intended for sale from those intended for use on these plantations.$^{50}$ To make things worse, this was the time when internal strife in many parts of the hinterland was producing large numbers of captives. The traders could easily invent new ways of evading the sultan's soldiers and the British naval patrol. A number of new concealed stations sprang up all along the coast between Pangani and Mombasa, from which small dhows could slip off at night and reach Pemba unnoticed. It is therefore clear that the slave trade remained a major activity well into the colonial period.\nThe European trade missions and the naval patrol against slave traders were limited to Zanzibar and the coastal areas. Although Europeans could no doubt obtain from Arab traders a few stories about places far away from the coast, the vast hinterland remained unknown to them. Gradually, however, events were to turn the attention of the humanitarians and the evangelicals to East Africa. Until 1856 their main interest was still focused on the trans-Atlantic trade. But as more became known about the horrors of the East African slave trade, European public attention was more and more drawn to the region."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.774, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1800-45', 'section_title': 'Omani international trade', 'content': ""Said is credited with having set in motion a series of economic and commercial policies that not only turned Zanzibar into the most important commercial emporium on the East African coast - importing manufactured goods from India, Europe and the USA, and exporting cloves, ivory, slaves, rhinoceros horns, gum copal and other goods - but also, inevitably, with tying East Africa's economy to the chariot wheel of the Western capitalist system, which enriched the Asian, European and American merchants at the expense of the indigenous East African societies, thus leading to their underdevelopment.\nUnder this merchant capitalist system, the human and material resources of East African societies were exploited through the unequal exchange that became entrenched between the parasitic foreign merchants based in Zanzibar on the one hand, and the coastal and hinterland peoples on the other.\nThe very sizeable profits obtained were expatriated to Europe, the USA and India and hardly ever invested in the physical or technological development of East Africa. The imported goods, exchanged for East African products like ivory, were inexpensive consumable items that were useless for capital development. The importation of some of them even undermined local industries, such as the textile industries of Lamu and the Benadir ports which were hard hit by Asian and, later, American cottons.\nAt the same time, the slave export trade and the inter-group fighting and raids associated with it reduced manpower capital in the hinterland of Tanganyika and contributed to the region's underdevelopment$^{36}$ and to its 'progress towards an inevitable dead end'. 37"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.722, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Omani penetration and the expansion of trade', 'content': 'Unfortunately no such data are available for East Africa.

But such a study would probably tell us very little about the numerous societies of the hinterland that were involved in commercial activities. It is known that by the 1870s the plantation economy, using slave labour, had begun to spread to the mainland coast and to the interior along the caravan routes, mainly in order to supply the food (grain) required to feed both the rich and the labouring sections of the population on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba, and to feed the large caravan expeditions to and from the hinterland.$^{4}$ But this does not give us a complete picture. Furthermore, even if a complete picture could be obtained, a demonstration that the African producer was getting more at a particular time than he was getting previously would not change the exploitative nature of the international capitalist trading system of the time. In fact the coastal traders and their African allies were but middlemen for European traders who were getting the largest share of the profits. The African producer was being exploited by both the middlemen and the European traders. The situation becomes worse in terms of comparison when the product is a human being! In addition we can say that, by being drawn into the world economy on unfavourable terms, the East Africans diverted their energies from developing their own economies for their own purpose to supply raw materials and labour in exchange for foreign-manufactured goods (mainly luxury items) that only benefited certain groups of people in society. In some of these societies the trade had the effect of killing or retarding some of the local industries producing similar items, such as the bark-cloth in the Lake region and the hand-woven cloth industry in south› western Tanzania.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Omani penetration and the expansion of trade', 'content': 'The expansion of the slave trade into the interior depended on the establishment of a plantation economy, firstly on the French-dominated islands of Mauritius and RØunion, but more significantly in the clove plantations of Zanzibar and Pemba. By the time Sayyid Said had transferred his economic interest to East Africa, the slave traffic to Mauritius had been reduced by British intervention and the island had even been taken over by them in 1810. But Seyyid Said encouraged the expansion of clove and coconut plantations in Zanzibar and Pemba. By the time he transferred his capital to Zanzibar in the 1840s, clove plantations were already the domi› nant economic activity and were mostly operated by slave labour. This created a class of landowners, originally mainly Arabs, but by the 1860s including indigenous Shirazi and Indians as well. By the 1860s it is estimated that the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba were absorbing about 10 000 slaves per annum. This was in addition to those supplied to other markets (largely Arab) abroad. It has been estimated that by the 1860s the Zanzibar market alone was handling as many as 70 000 slaves per annum and that the heaviest traffic started after 1840.$^{1}$ Although these figures may have been greatly exaggerated, they do indicate that the slave trade has increased tremendously by the middle of the nineteenth century.\nThe second commercial commodity exported from East Africa was ivory. In Chapter 9 we saw how its market was beginning to expand in the first decades of the nineteenth century due to increased demand in the industrialized West, apart from the traditional market in India. Previously Europe and the USA had obtained their ivory from West Africa. The demand for East African ivory, however, increased when it was discovered that it was of better quality (softer) and therefore more suitable for making luxury goods, such as combs, billiard balls and piano keys, which the richer classes were demanding. All British efforts to control this trade directly from East Africa failed because Indian merchants were already well entrenched in conducting the trade through Bombay from where it was re-exported to Europe.

The expanding clove plantation industry and the slave export trade had led to an increase in the East African slave trade. Estimates of the traffic in human cargoes during the nineteenth century have never been reliable. Latter-day scholars have tended to consider figures given by contemporary nineteenth-century sources - European visitors, naval officers, missionaries and explorers - as exaggerated.

His report serves, however, to underline the serious problem raised by the revival of slave-trading on the East coast of Africa. During the period 1860-70, between 30000 and 35000 slaves arrived in the ports controlled by Zanzibar: some were kept on the spot to work in the clove plantations. The remainder were sent as far as Somaliland and Oman; around 1870 Oman was importing 13000 slaves a year, some of whom travelled on to the Persian Gulf and Persia, Mesopotamia or Baluchistan and India.$^{48}$ In 1873, a treaty between Britain and the Sultan of Zanzibar introduced the right of search, including the authorization to seize Arab dhows, but it did not have much impact, just as the AngloPortuguese treaty of 1842 had had little effect on the Mozambique slave trade to the Comoro Islands and Madagascar.

In some cases the dominant class emerged stronger as a result of economic and military ties to the slave-traders. Consider relations between the Bemba rulers and the Arab and Swahili traders. Under the leadership of Chileshe Chipela the Bemba had just completed a phase of territorial expansion and political centralization when the foreign traders entered their homeland around i860. As a result, the Bemba kingdom was far more unified and powerful than most states in the region. The geographical position of the Bemba, somewhat removed from the principal trade routes, precluded the growth of a large and potentially seditious merchant community within the core of their kingdom. Equally important, there was no incentive for the Arab and Swahili traders to adopt a hostile posture since the Bemba were not economic rivals. Most of the royal families' wealth came from raiding and tribute in the form of ivory and slaves and they were happy to exchange them for the cloth and other imported goods provided by the coastal merchants. This economic complementarity fostered a harmonious relationship and simultaneously enhanced the internal position of the Bemba aristocracy, which used the foreign commodities to recruit new followers and strengthen their links to subordinate chiefs. The continued demand for captives and ivory also fuelled a new expansionist phase from i860 to 1880, during which Bemba forces conquered most of contemporary north-eastern Zambia. Thus, through ties to foreign merchants, the Bemba rulers gained unprecedented regional power while accumulating a substantial amount of wealth. 43 As in the case of the Bemba, other local chiefs and merchants entered into alliances with the slave-traders that proved extremely beneficial. Throughout the 1870s the Chewa chief, Mwase Kasungu, whose territory straddled the Lake Malawi-Katanga trade route, provided food for the Arab caravans in exchange for guns. These weapons enabled him to withstand the subsequent Mbwela Nguni invasions.$^{44}$ Economic con› siderations also motivated Arab and Swahili protection of the Senga chiefs, who were important suppliers of ivory.$^{45}$ Similar factors help explain Chikunda alliances with the Ambo against the Bemba, and assistance that they provided the Nsenga against the Soli, which occurred in the decade preceding the 'Scramble'.$^{46}$ In all these cases, it is clear that the aliens' strategy was to prevent"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.722, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': ""the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

The production areas, though sometimes 400-500 km distant, were mostly near the coast. Transactions were personal between local chiefs, caravaneers, brokers and agents. In Dahomey, on the other hand, the slave trade was one of the mainstays of the ruling house, which delegated the running of it to its chief vassals. In 1818 King Gezo, who was in debt to the Brazilian mulatto Francisco Felix Da Souza, appointed Da Souza as chacha, a 'white-man's chief who acted as an economic adviser and administrator of the Whydah trade. This office survived the death of the first chacha in 1849 and was inherited by Da Souza's son. It was management on a grand scale: the chachas kept a stock of Western goods, offset bookkeeping debits and credits, prepared cargoes in advance to facilitate speedy loading, collected taxes, checked the movements of white foreigners, and provided entertainment for their customers. This economic apparatus was capable of being adapted to other types of produce. Produce for the slave trade, which was in the hands of the chiefs, was secured by annual military expeditions, not always victorious, against the neighbouring countries, principally the Yoruba. It also came from the Central Sudan - whence captives were distributed, moreover, to the north and to Egypt - by caravans, which split up their loads at the border: the blacks earmarked for export, who were strong, were kept aside and incorporated in the ordinary porterage teams.$^{25}$ Further east, from Badagry to the borders of the kingdom of Benin, prolonged strife among the Yoruba people glutted the Whydah market.

An important and far-reaching economic policy adopted by Said bin Sultan was his encouragement of Indian enterprise and settlement. Asian commercial relations with the East African coast predate the nineteenth century, but there was no particularly notice› able Asian presence in Zanzibar or the mainland coast. Said admired Asian business acumen and expertise and decided that Asians would be useful in the commercial development and exploitation of his empire.

It was the beginning of their crucial and, soon, their dominant role as customs agents, middlemen, financiers or moneylenders and wholesale traders. While the growth of Asian settlement in Zanzibar and some mainland towns won them no political leverage or influence, it did give them a dominant and unsurpassed economic position. For example, Jairam Sewji gained considerable wealth during the period (1834-53) when the customs were farmed out to him, as did Taria Topan after him. Though their own income increased as custom dues rose over the years, invariably the sultans of Zanzibar remained in debt to the chief Asian customs farmers.

On the contrary, ivory exports also increased substantially as African merchants tried to satisfy the new markets in Britain and the USA as well as their traditional Asian clients. 25 As the demand for cheap labour and ivory skyrocketed, Yao, Bisa and Chikunda merchants expanded their commercial empires. The Yao penetrated into the Lake Nyasa region during the first half of the century and, after 1850, entered the Shire valley in search of new markets among the Manganja and Chewa. Simultaneously, they established commercial ties to the Indian Ocean port of Ibo, which became a major export centre. The Chikunda, initially in the service of Afro-Portuguese and Afro-Goan prazeros, extended their commercial contacts from the area immediately north of the Zambezi to the Luangwa valley and south into what is now Zimbabwe, while the Bisa intensified their operations in the territory between the Shire and Luapula valleys. All three groups continued to emphasize the ivory component of the trade as well and in the case of the Bisa traders it remained the dominant export commodity. 26 By the middle of the nineteenth century Central Africa had become a major supplier of slaves.

In some cases, they established per› manent communities in the interior, as did Jumbe of Khota Khota, located on the western shores of Lake Malawi. More commonly, however, the coastal entrepreneurs outfitted caravans that were sent to important inland markets where slaves and ivory were readily accessible. From contemporary Tanzania came the Nyamwezi traders, the most important of whom, Msiri, imposed his commercial and political hegemony throughout eastern Lunda.$^{32}$ By the middle of the century, news of the potential profits had filtered westward to Angola, motivating Mambari traders to initiate commercial relations with the Lozi and their Kololo overlords.$^{33}$ In short, increasing international demands for bond labour meant that much of the region north of the Zambezi became a labour reserve in which the principal activity became the 'production' of slaves."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'The Western impetus for abolition', 'content': ""Politically stronger states reacted differently to British pressure.

Between 1815 and 1830 the French illicit trade fitted out 729 slaving expeditions for the west and east coasts of Africa. But when it became clear that such operations no longer benefited French ports either financially or socially, the government signed a reciprocal search agreement. Another reason was that the mon› archy that emerged after the 1830 revolution felt it desirable to gain Britain's goodwill.$^{7}$ This volte-face by the French resulted in several small countries acceding to the 1831-3 agreements. Britain took the opportunity to renew its attempts to internationalize the issue, and extended its naval suppression to cover the whole of the Atlantic and Indian oceans. An 'equipment' clause in the treaties allowed the seizure of ships obviously equipped for the slave traffic, even though not carrying human cargoes. But the slave ships of the USA remained exempt. For forty years American diplomacy managed to evade any serious commitment. In 1820 the trade was legally equated with piracy; in 1842 came the compromise of'checking the flag', which protected the Americans from British suppressive action; and 80-gun suppression squadrons served to safeguard national pride whilst at the same time remaining mere formalities. In the 1840s the Southern planters called for the legal reopening of the trade, and meanwhile took to breeding slaves for the home market on special ranches.$^{8}$ During the Civil War the Lincoln administration committed itself to the right of search, which had been in abeyance since 1820. The American trade then stopped.\nThus for half a century the proliferation and accumulation of documents testify mainly to the emptiness of the undertakings entered into.

During the final decades of the nineteenth century, war broke out in virtually every decade and in virtually every region, and war meant captives. These victims were for the most part from sedentary agricultural communities, which served as a veritable breeding stock for the trade. Hence the underpopulated areas to be found in regions that were literally drained of their inhabitants. Tribute exacted in the form of captives was extremely heavy in many instances.

France imported an average of 4000 tonnes a year between 1847 and 1856 and 2000 tons in the following decade.

Something that had long been an abstract Utopian ideal - an alternative to the slave trade, a substitute for trade in men - had at last materialized. It remained to develop production on an industrial scale; and this took no longer than it had taken the Cuban and Brazilian plantations to reach full production of sugar and coffee. The main producing areas corresponded to the best slave-exporting areas, from Dahomey$^{44}$ to the rivers of the Niger delta and Cameroon. One of the essential features of the changeover was that manpower was mobilized on land that had been internally colonized. This admittedly meant that production was by means of a form of slavery, but within an African social and economic context. In fact the energetic development of this economic novelty did not immediately disrupt the traditional economy: slave trade and oil trade co-existed side by side. A more extensive system of barter began to radiate into the interior. On the coast the same agents for the Western trade still kept their grip on the market: they understood purchasing, gave credit, circulated traditional currencies, and introduced metal coinage. The increase in the number of people competing for trade upset the internal balance and led to a realign› ment of forces.$^{4S}$ These economic changes were accelerated by religious and cultural factors causing distortions, which were never very far removed from politics, which helped, however, to put an end to the trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.71, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'Implications of incorporation', 'content': ""Plantation slavery depended for its economic viability on reducing its total costs below a certain level, which depended heavily on the fact that recruitment to slave status was principally by means other than demographic reproduction. We have already suggested that the very process of expanding the quantity of slaves 'recruited' began to transform the economic character of the slave trade in western Africa, increasing the 'opportunity costs' of slave-trading and thereby affecting the rate of world accumulation.\nThis general phenomenon combined with a more narrow British concern.\nThe comparative productivity of sugar plantations in British West Indian territories declined throughout the eighteenth century.$^{40}$ A major zone of alternative production available was in British India.$^{41}$ This zone, however, was an area of existing dense agricultural production, where true slavery would have been economically too costly (if one wished to enslave the indigenous population) or politically too difficult (if one wished to import others). Hence the slave trade seemed to be less immediately useful for the production of sugar and other plantation crops in British zones while being counter-indicated if one wished to encourage cash-crop production in western Africa. Britain was at this point the hegemonic power in the world-system and was therefore in a politico-military position to carry out abolition. 42 Indian sugar became a major item on the British scene in 1791, following the crisis caused by the revolution in Santo Domingo. A considerable amount was sold between 1794 and 1800, see J. P. Marshall, 1968, pp. 88-9. The West India sugar lobby then succeeded in restoring the high tariff and imports from India declined.

Given the fact that 'the bigger financiers clearly had a foot in both camps' (ibid., p. 86), the resulting Parliamentary decisions might be seen as a compromise: the West Indian lobby lost on abolition but won on the East Indian tariff.

Our authorities are justly chargeable either with hypocrisy or inability. We give them their choice. Where both are so creditable, they can surely have no difficulty in selection. And hypocrites and fools have had their place in all Governments from time immemorial. After the loud and high-sounding professions we have nationally made about it, the continued existence of the slave-trade is a deep disgrace to us. It ought to be considered a point of honour for us to extinguish it. Instead of which, Cuba gets all the supplies she wants to grow our sugar with, and we rejoice in the cheap sugar they grow for us. Well, bad as it is, we can understand this. We can comprehend a Government and a Legislature selling honour and principle for the popularity of cheap sugar. But why they should sacrifice the national honour—the principles of humanity—the life blood of a quarter of a great continent—to the Arab pirates of the Persian Gulf—we cannot even imagine. There are more slaves sold in the markets of Zanzibar, and carried off, with little let or hindrance, in the Arab dhows, to be murdered in hard slavery by the cruel Mohammedans of the East, than are sent from the West Coast to Cuba. The exterminating influence of the slave-trade in Eastern Africa is notorious. The wars and slave hunts of the slavedealers are depopulating the country. Their every step is marked with blood and tears. And the conveyance of the poor wretches to the coasts of Arabia in the Arab dhows exceeds the worst horrors of the middle passage in the Atlantic slave ships. Is it not disgraceful that, with all our professions, we allow this, if we have the power to prevent it. And we have the power to prevent it. Competent authorities unanimously affirm that we have. We know that the contrary has been officially asserted. We do not care about this. Official assertions have very little weight with us against opposing facts. In the conversation of June 16, in the House of Commons, published by us last month, the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs is made to say that the British cruisers are doing their utmost to put an end to the traffic on the East Coast. One would judge, by the tenor of the remarks, that the only slave-trade there is one carried on by French agents, under the French flag, under the name of Free Labour Emigration. Now this is altogether wrong. Little, if any, is so carried on at present. The great slave-trade there is the slave-trade from Zanzibar to Arabia, carried on by Arabs in Arab dhows. These dhows carry away from 20,000 to 30,000 poor wretches every year. This involves a loss of life to Africa of nearly 100,000 people a-year, to say nothing of the immense and intense misery it produces. And the ""doing their utmost,"" so far as the British Admiralty is concerned, consists in the efforts made by one or two of the vilest tubs in the navy, appointed by the Admiralty for that service. We have no doubt the officers and crews of the vessels do their utmost. But if vessels are sent out totally unfit for the service, it is very little that the officers and crew can do, however great their zeal. And the Admiralty do not like zeal. Commodore Wilmot, if we are rightly informed, was too _zealous_ in going up to Abomey. Captain Oldfield, who, with Colonel Rigby, then Consul at Zanzibar, really did make a dash at that infamous traffic, was _too zealous_. But the slave-trade suppression service demands, requires, and must have zeal, if any good is to be done—if it is to be anything more than a costly farce, an infamous cheat. The Sultan of Zanzibar, the Imaum of Muscat, gets two dollars a-head for every slave sold in the Zanzibar market, and shipped for Arabia or elsewhere. If this accursed money be at the root of the evil, give him 60,000 dollars a-year, and insist on there being no more slave market, no more slave shipments at Zanzibar. Or, if this is impracticable, let two or three of the fastest vessels in our service, small, but thoroughly efficient, and officered by ""_little devils_,"" like Captain Oldfield,* be sent on that station, to capture, sink, burn, and destroy every Arab slave dhow. We are assured the entire traffic could be thus annihilated in a couple of years. Last Tuesday\'s _Gazette_ contains the information that Lieutenant-Colonel Playfair is appointed Consul at Zanzibar, and Lieutenant-Colonel Disbrowe Consul at Muscat. We hope we shall have to record fair play in this horrid slave-trade business on the eastern seas at last. If not, we shall call incessantly for some change. Why, if the annihilation of the slave-trade had been confided to private energy, instead of to official routine, it would long since have ceased to exist. If everything else fails, we had better try a new system. The entire service is said to cost more than 500,000l. a-year. Now, we have no more doubt than we have of the fact of our own existence, that if the business was confided to some such body as that of the ""Company of African Merchants,"" for example, they would, for half that sum, eradicate even the very roots of the slave-trade within the period of four or five years. We are certain that with this they could settle the whole question on the West and East Coasts, with Dahomey, Cuba, Zanzibar, and every other bar to human happiness—every other atrocious and interested slave-trade practitioner.

He trusted that Government would give the matter its best exertions, and he believed that a good deal might be done. The Sultan of Zanzibar, who had thrown in his lot with us, would, he was sure, efficiently second their exertions. He should mention, however, his impression that there was a slave-trade across the Red Sea independent of the traffic we were stopping at Zanzibar, and that that trade was increased by the stoppage of the Zanzibar trade. One great means, however, of stopping the whole trade lay rather with the purchasers than the dealers, and in getting the nations of Western civilization to influence the minds of Eastern sovereigns. His was reluctant to believe that the Khedive was extending his territory in Upper Egypt with the view of acquiring slaves; but, however that might be, much good might be done by missionary and legitimate trading efforts. He rejoiced that a consul had been appointed at Mozambique, and he learnt with satisfaction the promises of cooperation which had been given by the French Government.

There was much ignorance in this country as to the amount of the slave trade on the eastern coast of Africa. So far as they were able to gather, about 90,000 slaves were annually exported from the eastern coast, and each one of these cost the lives of from five to ten others, so that from 350,000 to 500,000 might be said to be yearly carried off by the man-hunters in order to supply the materials of this system of slavery. He thought, if the country were to realise the amount of this grievous evil, it would not rest without taking more active measures to remedy the evil. It was not merely the misery of those who were thus sentenced to slavery or death, but it was far more the desolation which the system carried into Africa itself—to which he referred. Dr. Livingstone, a thoroughly trustworthy witness, said that when in 1851 he first went to the shores of Lake Nyanza he found cultivation carried on to a high degree. He heard cotton mills at work on every side, and saw the flourishing products of a man's labour everywhere. But ten years after, when the slave trade had been driven, by the necessity of finding fresh victims, to the lake, all that remained was a handful of people who fled at the sight of any stranger, fearing the man-hunters. If we neglected to check this slave trade on the eastern coast, we should abandon the work which our fathers had done, and to a great extent make useless the sacrifices they made. He was convinced that the people of England were by no means ready to do that. The reports of the committees already mentioned encouraged the belief that we might do much to sweep away this great evil. Much injury has resulted from the compromise made in order to obtain concession from the Sultan of Zanzibar, and we required now a treaty which should make absolutely illegal all the export trade from the Zanzibar territory, and a further treaty to fix a time when the system of domestic slavery in Zanzibar itself should cease. It might be argued that the Sultan of Zanzibar would not agree to such arrangements, as the great part of his income was derived from the miserable wages he received for allowing this traffic. But it could be clearly shown that he would derive more from lawful trade, because Zanzibar was well fitted to be an export trade for the best products of Africa, and between 1861 and 1867 the customs at Zanzibar from legitimate traffic rose from 245,981l. to 483,693l. With respect to the payment of 8,000l., which was suggested, it was proposed that half of it should be paid out of the home revenue and half out of the Indian revenue. Thus we might obtain the assent of the Sultan of Zanzibar to a treaty which would enable us to do away with this grave abomination. No economy was so bad as spending a large sum of money, yet a sum which was just short of effecting its object. There had been recently published in Paris a pamphlet which charged the English people with want of honesty and truthfulness in their alleged desire to put down slavery. A more ridiculous idea could hardly have been put forward, but it should make us more than ever anxious to prove our sincerity and earnestness in the work of extirpating this abominable trade. He thought that the aid of France, of America, and of other great civilized Powers, should be invoked for the destruction of this traffic. They should prove to other countries that they were not holding back, but that they were ready to stimulate the inertness of other countries, and spur them on to a sense of their duty.

Before we had anything to do directly with the government of India, or any colonies in Africa, there was an immense trade, and healthy and vigorous, which had been going on for ages between East Africa and India. The early navigators tell that they found there considerable freedom, a certain amount of civilisation, and a very large amount of trade with India. A century after that the country had been for the greater part occupied by the Portuguese, in some part by Englishmen, and its commerce and prosperity had declined. Something had been done since then to revive a legitimate trade there, and there was a very considerable trade with other countries in Europe. That trade was capable of enormous development. The unhealthy districts were all on the coast. The interior was well-watered and healthy, and yet the inhabitants had been swept from it within living memory by the slave trade. Large regions had been depopulated, and that was the state in which it was now found. It was since we made ourselves masters of the Indian seas that the slave trade had grown to its present dimensions. It must now be put down. The meeting would, therefore, respectfully urge upon Her Majesty's Government to take steps for the prompt abrogation of those treaties, and to carry out in other respects the recommendations embodied in the report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons to secure an entire abolition of the slave trade in Eastern Africa.\n\nSir Thomas Buxton, who seconded the resolution, said the slave trade papers had from year to year contained a mass of information on the subject, furnished by captains and others, which left no doubt that a tremendous evil was going on; but at present there was little excuse for the ignorance that existed on the subject. Zanzibar was the port through which the trade was carried on. In many cases we had treated the native states of Zanzibar very much in the way we treated the native states of India. We had interfered in their political affairs and their internal arrangements. That and other circumstances showed we had a certain authority in that port and in the islands about it, and if that evil of the slave trade continued, the world would hold us responsible for it in a great degree."", 'last_edit_date': '1872-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1872#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.726, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LETTERS OF DR.

The market is with them a great institution, and they work hard and carry far in order to have something to sell. Markets are established about ten or fifteen miles apart. There those who raise cassava, maize, grain, sweet potatoes, exchange them for oil, salt, pepper, fish, and other relishes; fowls, also pigs, goats, grass-cloth, mats, and other articles change hands. All are dressed in their best—gaudy-colored, many-folded kilts that reach from the waist to the knee. When 2,000 or 3,000 are together they enforce justice, though chiefly women, and they are so eager traders they set off in companies by night, and begin to run as soon as they come within the hum arising from hundreds of voices. To haggle, and joke, and laugh, and cheat, seems to be the dearest enjoyment of life. They confer great benefits upon each other. The Bazenya women are expert divers for oysters, and they sell them and fish for farinaceous food from the women on the east of the Lualaba, who prefer cultivating the soil to fishery. The Manyuema have always told us that women going to market were never molested. When the men of two districts were engaged in actual hostilities the women passed through from one market to another unharmed; to take her goods, even in war, was a thing not to be done. But to these market women the half-caste directed their guns. Two cases that came under my own observation were so sickening, I cannot allow my mind to dwell upon or write about them. Many of both sexes were killed, but the women and children chiefly were made captives. No matter how much ivory they have obtained, these ""Nigger Moslems"" must have slaves, and they assaulted the markets and villages, and made captives, chiefly, as it appeared to me, because, as the men ran off at the report of guns, they could do it without danger. I had no idea before how bloodthirsty men can be when they can pour out the blood of fellow-men in safety. And all this carnage is going on in Manyuema at the very time I write. It is the Banians, our protected Indian fellow-subjects, that indirectly do it all. We have conceded to the Sultan of Zanzibar the right, which it was not ours to give, of a certain amount of slave trading, and that amount has been from 12,000 to 20,000 a-year.

A Sultan with a sense of justice would, instead of taking head money, declare that all were free as soon as they reached the territory. But the Banians have the customhouse and all the Sultan\'s revenue entirely in their hands. He cannot trust his Muhammadan subjects, even of the better class, to farm his income, because, as they themselves say, he would get nothing in return but a crop of lies. The Banians naturally work the custom-house so as to screen their own slaving agents; and so long as they have the power to promote it, their atrocious system of slavery will never cease.

And this has been at once effectual. The Sultan, we are informed by telegram, has signed the Treaty, and the slave market was closed the same day. So far, good. A change had taken place at Zanzibar since the Sultan proved so intractable with Sir Bartle Frere. It will be remembered that the influence of the French Consular authorities had been employed to strengthen the Sultan in his ideas of resistance. Through their sinister efforts, France and the Sultan of Zanzibar were held up to the world as conjoint in the East African slave trade iniquity. This was too much. M. Thiers, then President of the French Republic, ordered an immediate change, and that French influence should be used the other way. M. Thiers would have joined England in coercion, if necessary; but the mere threat has been enough. The Sultan saw his game was played out—or the Arab slave traders did, which is the same thing—and the Sultan has accepted the Treaty. We presume this Treaty provides for the entire abolition of all slave importation from the mainland to Zanzibar. Nothing short of this will suffice. If the slaves already at Zanzibar be properly treated, their natural increase will supply all reasonable wants of the Sultan, and Zanzibar cultivation. Not one more African should be allowed to be brought to Zanzibar, and then, with due naval vigilance, the Arab slave trade on the East Coast will be at an end. But this is not all that was required as regards the East African slave hunts, and export slave trade. There are still the slave hunts to supply the trade carried on from the Portuguese territory, so called,—on which we remarked in our last, when reviewing Captain Sulivan\'s admirable work.

Waller, of which we give the outline:\n\nWhile on the one hand we see singular devices set forth for stopping the slave trade in Central Africa, where everything is against European life and all in favour of the fever-proof slaves, we neglect opportunities for dealing with it at a spot which has long been a scandal to the Arab ruler of Zanzibar and to our own country. This island of Pemba lies 30 miles north of Zanzibar. The coast of Africa is separated from it by a channel of 50 miles\' width. A dead flat, the island is turned to account by a few Arab tenants who hold their lands of the Sultan of Zanzibar and cultivate cloves with more or less success. As a rule, they are in the hands of Parsee money-lenders, and are mulcted by duties of 50 per cent. to 60 per cent. on the exports of their cloves. But the trade continues, because it is possible to import numbers of slaves who are worked to death at a rate unknown on the mainland.\n\nThe duty of acting as ""preventive men"" devolves upon the officers and crews of the British men-of-war stationed upon the East Coast. The coast opposite Pemba is all that the slave trader can desire. Serrated with creeks in which dhows can load up for the run across, it is impossible to frustrate the embarkation of slaves; a high tide and a fair wind together with a dark night, make it 100 to 1 in favour of the venture. The island is reached before dawn, the slaves are hurried inland, and are at once concealed. The deaths of Captain Brownrigg and Lieut. Cooper ought to open the eyes of all concerned to the anomalies of the Pemba slave trade; the first to come to his senses should be the British taxpayer. A large part of the time employed in suppressing slavery on the East Coast is expended in watching this small island. The outlay over the last twenty years may be put at a million sterling in hard cash, to say nothing of men lost in fighting and by fever.\n\nAt the present moment all is transit in on Zanzibar waters. English, German, and French forces are assembled there, and have done honour to our dead officers and men. To the first Power concerned, it is an old tale of frittering away money, varied now and again by the loss of valuable lives.\n\nMeanwhile the Sultan sends off soldiers to Pemba as he sent envoys to Lake Nyassa; the result will be the same.

The numbers affected by the abolition of the _status_ of slavery in Zanzibar in ratio to the population are, it is contended, far greater than in any previous experiment tried, and a loss of two-thirds of the productive value of the islands, combined with the ruin and probable exodus of the greater portion of the free population, has been predicted as among the consequences to be expected from abolition. In one of his reports, Consul-General Hardinge estimates the loss to Government revenue at about £26,000 a year, and, at the same time, the new expenditure entailed by the movement at £20,000. The annual income of Zanzibar averages £75,000, with an expenditure of £65,000, and Mr. Hardinge pointed out that to reduce the revenue to £51,000, while expenditure was increased to £86,000, was to saddle the exchequer of Zanzibar with a deficit of no less than £35,000. It has also been pointed out that the loss to the masters would be too serious to be met without compensation, and the sums which compensation was likely to amount were stated in alarming figures.

The institution of slavery is maintained only by force of law in any country in which it flourishes. British law will not allow its Courts to be prostituted to the maintenance of injustice, and all that we do when we abolish the legal _status_ of slavery is to refuse the countenance of the law to claims which we believe to be unjustifiable when they are advanced by one man over another. Compensation in Zanzibar is, in certain circumstances, to be paid, not for exercising the right to administer justice in the Courts, but because a personal guarantee was given to special slave owners that the _status_ of their slaves should not be altered. It is, in fact, a concession to the Moslem view of slave owning. The number of these lawfully held slaves, as has been seen, is small. Compensation will be given only for those who actually claim their freedom, and the sum required is not likely to amount to any formidable total. The Sultan has so loyally accepted the British point of view that we only meet him in a reciprocal spirit when we promise him some help in the event of any financial difficulties which may result. In West Africa, where no special promise has been made, no responsibility for compensation would appear to have been incurred. On both sides of the Continent the abolition of the legal _status_ of slavery is a leaven of freedom which may confidently be left to work.

Smuggling is rife from all the Mrima between Mboamaji and Waseen, and preparations, it is said, are made on a large scale to run, with the change of monsoon, to Arabia and the Persian Gulf. The transport by sea has, in fact, been replaced by the inland route. The removal of all Customs duties is an advantage to the dealer. Formerly he had to pay 2 dols. 50c. to the Sultan\'s dues on each slave, besides chartering a vessel at a heavy rate, for which freight was paid in advance, and in order to get clear of Kilwa, was compelled to borrow money at a ruinous rate. He was invariably in debt in former days; now he finds himself working on his own capital. After the treaty, he at once repudiated his accounts with the Indian merchant, and as an experiment marched his slaves to the north, where he sold them at a large profit, returned by sea to Kilwa, and was able to take advantage of the immense rise in prices owing to the demand for labour in Pemba. As a result, the slave-trader who a year ago was heavily in debt and trammelled in every way, is now a capitalist, and able to pay cash for the goods required to equip his next large venture towards the Nyassa or the country at the back of the Upper Rufiji. He no longer asks for credit, and it is not the merchant\'s business to inquire whether his ready-money customer is engaged in the traffic. At Brava and Lamu slaves are in large demand, and Pemba is still unsatisfied; neither will Arabia and the Persian Gulf be contented to forego their usual supplies. Hence it is positive every encouragement is given to reckless smuggling. Should ventures from these ports succeed, a large access of capital will be the result; but even if they fail, sufficient capital is in hand from the immense profits of the past year to carry on the trade in 1874-75.

This can only be done by the opening up of the interior to legitimate trade, which, it is hoped, will be effected by the German and British associations into whose hands the bulk of the dominions of the late Sultan has fallen.

He presented to the English Church Mission the grounds on which the buildings and cathedral are erected, and gave to the latter a handsome clock and chime of bells.

The arguments against it have been held so powerful that the consummation of British policy has been for a long period delayed. The successful operation of similar Acts in India, on the Gold Coast and elsewhere, has been deemed foreign to the discussion of the situation in Zanzibar, where it has been held that the conditions offered no parallel with previous cases. To arrive at any correct appreciation of the effect within the dominions of the Sultan, it is necessary to consider the social and economic conditions of Zanzibar and the history of the anti-slavery movement in the islands to which the decree of abolition will apply. Every Englishman must feel satisfaction in the reflection that British protection is no longer extended to the support of a system so repugnant to British sentiment; but there exists also a desire to understand how such a change can be brought about, in a community dependant upon slave labour, without inflicting more suffering than benefit upon the persons affected. This desire will be supported by the conviction that, if no convulsion is produced, no great change in the condition of the enslaved population can have taken place, and, consequently, that the benefits of abolition are rather theoretical than practical. This attitude of mind is reflected in the two classes of objections that have been advanced against the step which has just been taken. It has been urged, on the one hand, that the abolition of slavery in Zanzibar and Pemba is impossible, as the economic obstacles are too great, and, on the other hand, that this abolition is unnecessary, as all that could thereby be effected has been done already by proclamations and decrees tending towards abolition in the islands. The truth, probably, lies between these two propositions, and the value of the Act of abolition will become apparent as the nature of the reform is realised.\n\nThe population of Zanzibar and Pemba is about 210,000 persons, of whom no fewer than 140,000 are believed to be slaves. By the decree just issued the position of slave is no longer legally recognised in the country, and all these persons may claim their freedom. It is important to notice this difference between the abolition of the legal _status_ of slavery and the abolition of slavery pure and simple. By the abolition of slavery pure and simple, every slave is actually freed. By the abolition of the legal _status_ of slavery the support of the law is withdrawn from the maintenance of the condition of slavery, and the slave is put in a position to claim his freedom. Until he so chooses he remains a slave, but the continuance of his slavery is voluntary, of which the law refuses to take cognisance.

They actively participated in forging the new communities which formed the bases for the later heterogenous and polyphonous societies.

They were pioneers and conquistadors, pirates and bucaneers, gauchos, llaneros, bandeirantes, slave-owners, merchants, servants and slaves.

The much-heralded black emigration schemes trumpeted by Garvey, whose ubiquitous publications reached deep into Africa, were only one example of a leitmotif which brought American blacks within the world view of African peoples. The themes of African redemption through American black missionaries were another.\nAfricans themselves, however, created the context of their next interaction with American blacks as they matriculated at American, largely Afro-American, schools and attended pan-African conferences and the like. Consequently, many Africans underwent a technical-educationalpolitical experience alien to their colonial world. When they re-entered their own worlds, many felt driven to resolve questions of ideology, cultural definition, educational values, political power, and pan-African unity or consciousness, guided by new perspectives.\nViewed against such an historical backdrop, the numerous pan-African conferences, Tuskegean educational and technical projects, the nØgritude movement and the occasional focus on American blacks in African millen› nial dreams, all illustrate the consistency of the pan-African theme among American and Caribbean blacks.

Because of this vision, Africans had been educated in American schools, or sent to participate in technical and commercial activities; others were touched by American black writings or by anti-colonial ventures organized among blacks of the diaspora. This latter vision seemed not so much to discard as simply to vindicate and to reorientate to an African perspective the idealism implied in the earlier vision.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The impact of Africa', 'content': 'Where they could - and where they had no other recourse - Africans and Afro-Americans adjusted to the conditions in which they found them› selves.

Cre› ativity became especially necessary where a small number of Europeans lived among a large number of Africans as was the case in many colonies of exploitation such as Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Saint-Domingue. Where the European population failed to comprise a critical mass, the Africans had to build a society from a diverse collectivity of individuals who had little more in common than their skin colour and their servility.

Maroon towns existed for equally long periods in Esmeraldas in Ecuador and in parts of the Blue Mountains and the Cockpit Country of Jamaica.

The 'benefit' to the world-economy was essentially the surplus value produced by the slave minus the 'cost'. Once Africa was 'inside' the world-economy, that is, was producing on its soil commodities that were part of the division of labour of the worldeconomy, then someone who was a slave was not something else, for example a free peasant producer or a wage-labourer. Therefore, although the 'cost' of the slave remained the same perhaps for the slave-owner, the 'benefit' had to be recalculated from the point of view of the world-economy as a whole. The numerator of the equation had to take into account the 'alternative' accumulation from some other use of the individual. It may be that he/she would have produced still more net surplus value if not enslaved. Furthermore, and crucially, the denominator changed since the years of reproduction, formerly usually outside these calculations, were now part of them. Therefore, the net accumulation from the slave years was reduced while the net accumulation if not enslaved remained the same. Ergo, the calculus was less favourable to slavery, from the point of view of the accumulation process in the world-economy as a whole.\nNonetheless, it was not these changing economic implications of the slave trade that would have the greatest impact on Africa's future develop› ment but a more fundamental process that was occurring within the capitalist world-economy. The first long economic and geographic expan› sion of the capitalist world-economy had occurred between 1450 and 160050. In that period, no part of Africa could be said to have been part of this historical system. The period 1600/50-1730/50 was, for the capitalist worldeconomy, a period of relative stagnation, of taking a breath, of consolidation, primarily within the geographic zones that had already been included in the sixteenth century. It was still largely true at this time that no part of Africa could be said to have been incorporated into this system (with the reservations noted about the changing structure of the slave trade). 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'Introduction', 'content': 'The remarkable mass migration of Africans to the Americas, the Middle East and Europe under the aegis of the trans-Atlantic and other branches of the slave trade constitutes one of the major events of African and world history.$^{1}$ This emigration, largely involuntary on the part of the participants, lasted for centuries, leaving residual communities of varying sizes scattered about in Europe, the Middle East and the Americas. 2', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The impact of Africa', 'content': 'When the American slave systems disintegrated during the nineteenth century, the basic institutional forms and social attitudes of the societies had already been established.

In some cases, the influences from Africa were strong enough and pervasive enough to forge a genuine Afro-American culture competing with, and sometimes complementing the Europeanderived culture.\nIn the USA the political-structure imposed a rigid dichotomy between black and white in the population, relegating any individual with any degree of African ancestry to the category of black.$^{51}$ By contrast, throughout the rest of the hemisphere a three-tiered social categorization prevailed, corres› ponding to the dominant groups of black, mixed, and white. The relatively small number of white persons at the top of the social pyramid in most societies afforded the dominant African majorities the opportunity to impose their values and their cultures on the rest of the society.\nWithin the three-tiered structure each caste had its own set of legal rights and social privileges based on a combination of wealth, colour and occupation. In the sugar and plantation-based economic zones of Brazil, the Caribbean, and the lowlands of Mexico, Colombia and Peru, the rights of slaves as well as free persons of colour tended to be circumscribed in direct proportion to the overall demands of their labour. In the coffee, cattle and fishing areas of south-eastern Brazil, Puerto Rico, eastern Cuba, and the interior provinces of Venezuela and Argentina, social mobility tended to be greater, social distances shorter, and internal class and caste distinctions more relaxed and less formal than in the plantation zones.

Furthermore states were constructed in this same era which were quite remote from the world-economy as, for example, the Rozvi.$^{35}$ Also it is quite obvious, by looking at the West African states, that there is an imperfect connection between participation in the slave-trade and state-formation. If the two went hand to hand for Dahomey and Oyo, in Benin we had the formation of a strong state without such participation, and the inverse was true for the Niger delta. 36 The point, however, is a different one. It is that involvement in the world-economy required political structures that ensured the functioning of the economy; its commerce, its production, its labour-force supply.\nThe outside pressure was to have such structures.$^{37}$ Where the existing structures performed the necessary functions, for whatever reason, there was little pressure to change them. But, of course, the involvement in the world-economy increased the economic importance to given internal producers of sympathetic political structures. It is the internal producers who pressed to change the structures.$^{38}$ This led to various kinds of turmoil, which were of limited benefit to other participants in the world-economy. The latter in turn pressed for political stabilization, which took the form of creating states which participated in and were therefore constrained by the interstate system.$^{39}$ Ultimately, as we know, this led in most of Africa to the creation of colonial states. The abolition of the slave trade was a crucial political and economic event in this process. As plantation slavery and the slave trade were phenomena deriving from the operation of the capitalist world-economy, so was the abolition of the slave trade and of plantation slavery. I do not wish here to re-open the question of the importance of the abolitionists as a pressure group in this process. They of course existed and were part of the process.

The institutions of slavery slowly crumbled from within and without. The curious combination of political freedom which gave white Americans a greater voice in their internal affairs, economic selfinterest, humanitarianism, imperial incompatibility, and the unquenchable thirst for liberty on the part of the enslaved, ultimately destroyed the American slave system.$^{44}$ The political independence of the USA after 1776, Haiti after 1804, the mainland Spanish colonies after 1825, and Brazil after 1822, gave a different complexion to the political dimension of the system of slavery and the slave trade, and had repercussions outside the parochial boundaries of each empire, colony and state.\nThe loss of the British North American colonies in 1783 and the termination of the British slave trade in 1808 affected slavery and the African in profound ways. The largest and most efficient supplier removed itself from the market, and began an intensive campaign to persuade other European states to follow its example. The British anti-slavery campaign sharply reduced the number of Africans taken to the Americas during the nineteenth century, although the total remains high. Before the trade ended in 1870, the pattern returned to that which prevailed during its first century.$^{45}$ The Spanish and Portuguese colonies again became the major importers. Of the nearly 2 million Africans who arrived in the New World during this period, more than 1.1 million (or about 60 per cent) went to Brazil. More than 600000 (about 31.9 per cent) went to the Spanish Antilles, with the greater proportion by far going to Cuba. The rest went to the French Caribbean, with a small number entering the USA.\nThe trans-Atlantic slave trade, and therefore the migration of Africans, responded to the expanding demands for a labour force to develop the agricultural potential of the new-found lands as well as the supply con› ditions for Africans in Africa.$^{46}$ Most Africans consequently entered plan› tation agricultural complexes in the Americas.\nBut since the plantation complex varied throughout the Americas the socializing forces within which the Africans and their descendants would mould their own American culture likewise varied.

Repatri› ation during the nineteenth century offered few material rewards for Europeans or non-Europeans. But by 1900, the divergence between Africa and the Americas had become too great. Persons of African descent became caught up in the self-consciousness of the age which produced the type of xenophobic nationalism that all but destroyed the appeal of Africa. More› over, the interest in Africa after the end of the slave trade grew from national lusts for power and wealth - and Afro-Americans lacked both political power and the wealth needed to stimulate their own interest, or influence those who were partitioning Africa into colonial spheres. The Afro-American view became focused more on the new developments within their hemisphere. Internal and inter-regional migrations and the quest to establish the good life against new deleterious challenges absorbed their attention. The African connection faded, but did not die. The return-toAfrica movement found individual promoters who could occasionally infuse the movement with new appeal. In 1897, Henry Sylvester Williams, a Trinidadian-born lawyer living in London, founded the Pan-African Association, whose later membership would include George Padmore, Kwame Nkrumah and C. L. R. James. In the 1920s Marcus Garvey founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association, a movement designed to spur African decolonization and unite all Africans wherever they were found.

Plantation slavery emerged, either in the form of slave settlements in the rural areas managed according to customary law on the Guinea coast, or Islamic law in the Muslim areas, or approximating to American-type plantations in the Indian Ocean islands. With the increased use of people of slave origin as warriors and in administrative positions at various courts, it has been estimated that in many parts of Africa slave populations could range between 25 and 50 per cent of the total population.$^{19}$ Although there were examples of slave revolts, and the particular example of the Lozi who threw off their Kololo overlords,$^{20}$ generally the slave populations did not form a distinct class.

Elsewhere, the prevalent ethos was acculturation and integration into the society through individual households. While the degree of integration was clearly limited - as witnessed by the number anxious to be redeemed or, having been emancipated by colonial laws, who were anxious to return to their original homes - it was real enough to suggest that the dynamics of change in most of the African communities was the tension of age and sex within each household, and of status and competition for power between the lineages and kinship groups, rather than between broad classes in society.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""It is clear that, at some point, the slave-dealers were no longer 'foraging' for persons to be enslaved but had begun to be engaged in systematic It should also be noted that the total curve for Africa masks a geographic shift.

The Society would sell shares or land rights offered by African petitioners but only to Afro-American or African purchasers. 4 Bishop Turner also later served as an adviser to the International Migration Society (IMS) of Alabama, which sent about 500 emigrants to Africa before it became defunct in 1900. Some of the 500 remained in Liberia; others returned to the United States. Those who remained fared reasonably well; evidently more than a few of them prospered. On the other hand, those who returned told horror stories of poor land, inadequate food and poor living conditions. These stories reduced the likelihood of any large-scale Afro-American emigration movement, even though prospects for blacks in the United States were declining from 1895 to 1900.

For example, one Captain Dean, early in the twentieth century, hoped to engineer the settlement of American blacks in South Africa to fashion a powerful black state there. After the briefest sojourn meant to arrange for this settlement, however, white authorities expelled Dean from the Cape for what were termed 'provocative activities'. And in 1914, Chief Alfred C.

Doubtless there are some brilliant exceptions; but with the vast majority of American citizens, there is a morbid dislike, we might even say hatred of the race to which America owes so much. It is the same all through society—in the church as well as in the world—the Negro is scouted and despised. And whence does this strong prejudice arise? It may safely be said that in any European nation an African is as secure of his rights and privileges as any native-born citizen. And what is the experience? Do we ever hear of crime and trouble to the authorities arising from this—well, let us call it concession? The unanimous answer must be in the negative. It is altogether inconceivable why the United States—the champion of liberty—should be so backward in its treatment of so many of its best and most peaceable citizens. The debt America owes to Africa is incalculable; and she seems determined to deny her liability, even by way of recognising the social and political rights of the descendants of those who were brought against their will to labour in the fields and plantations of the New World, and thereby laid the foundation of its present importance and prosperity. From all that one can learn, the position of the freed Negroes is becoming more and more intolerable as the year of emancipation recedes into the past. Probably this is in no small degree owing to the fact that freedom was conceded to the slave merely as a political necessity, and not as in Europe generally as a result of the awakening of the nations\' conscience that a great wrong had been committed against Africa.\n\nFor the sake of our boasted civilisation, it is to be hoped that American citizens will come to recognise, before it is too late, that it is their duty, and also to their advantage, to accept the Negro as a man and a brother; to whom, indeed, no small share in the destinies of the world are committed.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Capabilities of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Dear Brother in the cause of God and humanity,—The elevation of Africa is near my heart, and anything that promises to aid in rescuing her from her long and deep degradation meets a warm response in my heart.

We had buried our first-born there, a little boy of six years.\n\nBut poor Africa—what can be done for her? I rejoice in the success of Dr. Livingston, and of every other explorer and labourer in Africa; but much more need to be and can be done for her. 1. She needs missionaries and teachers, but these alone will not do the work needed.

The people are capable of being educated in the arts and sciences, in which they make rapid proficiency when an opportunity is provided. In managing business, mercantile or other, they manifest an ability equal to the whites. The richest men in Sierra Leone are negroes who were taken out of the slave ship. They make very efficient preachers, teachers, mechanics, farmers, &c., when instructed.\n\n2. The country is rich—very productive in many things needful for commerce and home consumption. Rice, Indian corn, and some smaller grains, suited to exportation, can be produced to any extent. Ginger, pepper, arrowroot, can be supplied to meet the wants of the world. Coffee and cotton of fine quality grow wild abundantly, and can be cultivated to any extent to supply Manchester and every cotton factory in Christendom. There only needs to do this to start it all along the Western Coast, and make a market for them, and the natives will go to producing them. They will work at what they can make the most money by. Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down.

This trade, once inaugurated, was carried on by the Egyptians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and Europeans down to the end of the last century, when the revival of human feeling urged certain philanthropists in England to move towards the abolition of a great evil. But during all this period the negro himself was as much to blame as the white and yellow men; indeed, it was probable that negroes were enslaving negroes long before Egyptian or Arab bought black servants from the negro chiefs, and at the present day there would be no slavery in Africa if an approval of slavery were not present in the philosophy of the negro tribes of Africa. Slavery and the slave trade, with the tribal wars and their attendant insecurity, had been the cause of Africa's backward condition, and if ever that Continent were to be raised to the civilisation of Europe, slavery and the slave trade must be extirpated. The two great slave markets which, until a few years ago, had existed in America, and in Turkey and Persia rendered the inducements to slave traders so great that the guarding of the coasts of Africa by British cruisers only checked the trade in a very slight degree; and even now many slaves were sent to Arabia, Persia, and Madagascar. In the present day, however, Africa was the main consumer of its own slaves. The most remarkable revival of the slave trade and occurred in German East Africa. The Germans, under Major Von Wissmann, began by suppressing a revolt of the Arab slave dealers, which led to the almost complete extinction of the oversea slave traffic on the German coast of East Africa; but the organisation of a strong government led to the rapid settling down of the Arabs as great landed proprietors, with an unlimited number of slaves to work their plantations. Legally slavery could not exist in German territory, but in such a wide and sparsely populated region it was impossible to prevent it in fact; and as the slaves were ordinarily well and kindly treated, it never occurred to them to want to leave their masters or to better their condition. It might be asked where, then, was the harm of slavery? The harm lay in this, that slavery commenced with an initial evil. The speaker then drew a picture of the loss of life, devastation of countries, and breaking of family ties which attended a capture of slaves. This depopulation of whole regions was attended with another evil, the return of the dreaded tsetse fly; and the surest way of extirpating this pest was to encourage population in the fertile districts of Central Africa. They must not expect much from the people themselves.

One race hands the torch of science to another; but no one seems to know how to strike the fire for itself. Had no invader gained a footing in England, this island would have remained in barbarism to this day; and America had been still the hunting-ground of the savage, had not civilization been imported. Africa is behind the rest; and yet not very far behind, for in the life of humanity three or four centuries are but as three or four years in the life of a man. She has not made time with her sister continents in the race of improvement, not because she is a sandy desert, for the fertility of her soil is exuberant, capable of enriching commerce with a profusion of valuable products which the world wants, but because she has been reserved for the habitation of black men, and the white men who attempt to explore and cultivate her perish.

That committee reported against it, and stated that those 5,000 free negroes paid into the treasury of Charleston annually 27,000 dolls., and that their property amounted annually to 1,500,000 dolls. Out of that amount of property, 300,000 dolls. of it was composed of slaves. That the 9,000 free negroes of New Orleans in 1860 were worth as much *per capita* as the white people of Louisiana; that these free negroes had their own schools, their own benevolent societies, &c. These facts, he contended, proved that the free negro was capable of taking care of himself. He also stated that a lady who owned 500 negroes in 1860 told him that she had lost them all but 200 by the beginning of 1863. That year she made a contract with them to cultivate her farm on the shares, and that last year, under such a system, where the negro was working for himself as well as for his mistress, the 200 made her more money than 500 had done in slavery.""\n\n---\n\n**NOTICE OF PARTNERSHIP.**', 'last_edit_date': '1865-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SLAVERY AND THE SLAVE-TRADE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Brazil has alone retained the curse which she inherited from her Portuguese rulers.

It is pleasing to note that a strong abolition movement has lately taken place in Brazil, resulting in the freedom of many thousands of slaves.\n\nLet us now turn to contemplate the ""unhappy hunting-grounds"" of the world—the boundless blood-stained territories of the ""Dark Continent.""\n\nThe whole of the West Coast of Africa is now nominally free from the curse of the slave-trade, though slavery still exists among all the native tribes, and in the Portuguese settlements forced labour is carried on under *indenture*, which is a form little removed from that of actual slavery. Free settlements, such as Liberia, Sierra Leone, &c., have progressed considerably under the influence of commerce and free labour, and this progression would have been much more rapid were it not for the stigma that attaches to labour in all countries where slavery has been a permanent institution. On the East Coast of Africa the great island of Madagascar has cleared itself from the reproach of the slave-trade. The importation of slaves from Africa was put an end to by the late Queen Ranavalonamanjaka II. in the year 1877. With regard to the Portuguese territories in Africa (Mozambique, &c.), it is difficult to speak with precision. The authorities declare that no slave-trade exists, but the evidence of English officials and missionaries in Eastern Africa throws considerable doubt upon that statement. Zanzibar alone of all the Arab powers on the East Coast of Africa has cleared herself from the stigma of the slave-trade. The mission of Sir.

677,"Regional conflicts in Africa were often driven by the economic motivations of slave trading, with wars and raids primarily aimed at capturing slaves, leading to instability and disruption of traditional trade routes and relationships.","The observations from both the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles provide substantial support for the claim that regional conflicts in Africa were often driven by the economic motivations of slave trading. The textbook describes how intensified competition among traders and the demand for captives led to raiding and conquest as dominant modes of slave acquisition, replacing earlier forms of legal commerce. This shift resulted in the destruction of social and political structures, as well as economic dislocation, as communities were raided for slaves, leading to instability and disruption of traditional trade routes and relationships. It also highlights how reliance on European weapons and the need to maintain economic hegemony fueled conflicts, with entire groups specializing in the extraction of slaves. Furthermore, the abolition of the slave trade introduced structural imbalances, leading to internal conflicts among trading factions. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize that wars and raids were primarily aimed at capturing slaves, which led to instability and disruption of traditional trade routes and relationships. The articles note that wars in certain regions were instigated for the purpose of slave-catching, with warriors prioritizing the capture of slaves over other objectives.

Whereas most slaves had probably been obtained through legal commerce in the preceding period, raiding and conquest replaced it as the dominant mode of acquisition. According to Chikunda traditions; for example, in the earlier phase of the slave trade they were able to purchase Nsenga, Chewa and Tonga slaves, many of whom were originally criminals, social outcasts or strangers. Subsequently, however, they used coercive tactics to satisfy the coastal demand. 34 Similarly, Yao itinerant traders initially exploited their access to cheap cloth and iron hoes to achieve a pre-eminent commercial position, but external pressures during the second half of the century motivated them to exert military pressure in the Shire valley in order to ensure their economic hegemony.$^{35}$ Makua participation in the slave trade underwent a parallel transformation while force had always been a component of the Arab-Swahili strategy. 36 To ensure a constant supply of captives and ivory, a number of trading groups carved out sizeable conquest states. Although differing in detail, these polities shared common characteristics that shaped their historical development. All these alien overlords relied heavily on European weapons to impose their hegemony and maintain their pre-eminence. These soph› isticated weapons were acquired in exchange for captives in an updated version of the gun-slave cycle. Once firmly entrenched, the alien ruling classes expanded the frontiers of their empire; while the amount of force varied, coercion was the dominant mechanism of incorporation. The new acquisitions provided additional sources of slaves and ivory, which were used to increase the size of their arsenals, thereby enabling further expan› sion.

First, the manner in which slaves were procured tended to destroy social and political structures. Social outcasts, offenders against the law, were sold into slavery. A few persons were sold in times of famine or for debt. But the majority of slaves were apparently taken by kidnapping, raiding and wars. The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda. Accordingly, the extensive influence exercised by the Aro over Igboland through its oracle did not become an integrative force.$^{9}$ The element of violence inherent in Aro addiction to the slave trade thus distinguished their influence from the earlier ritual influ› ence of the Nri people over wide areas of Igboland.\nIn the economic sphere also, the disruption to normal agricultural activities must have been considerable. In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars. The metal bars were turned into pewters, ritual bells, state swords, leg-rings, and other ornaments.

By the last quarter of the century it was estimated that a quarter of the Lozi population were slaves. Similarly, Nguni dynamism was premised upon their ability to incorporate and extract surplus from their large pool of captives. 51 Allowing for local variations, a broad pattern of economic dislocation resulting from the slave trade is nevertheless discernible. The violent disruption of much of the rural economy, the export of many of the most productive members of the indigenous societies, the inadvertent introduction of highly contagious diseases, and the growing dependence of the Central African economy on the world trading system intensified the process of underdevelopment. It is true that this process was accompanied by the dissemination of new crops such as tobacco, maize, rice and cassava, the introduction of modest technological innovations like the Chikunda traps, granaries, and weapons, and the expansion of some local industry. But these were relatively insignificant developments when placed in juxtaposition to the economic retardation of the region as a whole. 52 Little needs to be said about the unprecedented level of destruction that While slavery had been a feature of many Central African societies before the slave trade, preliminary evidence suggests a growing tendency to acquire captives to extract surplus which the aristocracy used to maintain its privileged position.

Everywhere they saw sad signs of the war - villages burnt, gardens uncared for, the beautiful land about them rapidly becoming desert.

In several instances, they overstepped their authority and enslaved their own subjects or neighbours in order to main› tain the flow of wealth and weapons upon which their power rested. The Makua aristocracy pursued such a self-destructive strategy. Until the 1850s the Makua had been the principal exporters of slaves to Mozambique Island. One by-product of their predatory activities was a large-scale migration of the victimized societies. Faced with a diminished labour pool the Makua rulers began raiding each other and enslaving their own subjects in order to maintain the profitable slave trade on which they had become totally dependent. Within two decades the Makua were badly fragmented, leaving them easy prey to subsequent Portuguese invasions.$^{47}$ The AfroPortuguese prazero community exhibited a similar myopic desire for profits which precipitated the rapid demise of the prazo system. As in the case of the Makua chiefs, the prazeros violated their historic charter and began to enslave people living on their lands when they could no longer acquire captives from the interior. In reaction to these excesses the indigenous population either revolted and drove the prazeros off the land or fled into the interior, depriving the estate owner of his traditional source of tribute. The effect, in either case, was the destruction of most prazos by 1830, and those that managed to survive suffered from recurring famines that so debilitated the indigenous population that they proved no match for the attacks of the subsequent decades.

As in the case of West Africa, the slave trade figured prominently in the process by which the region, especially north of the Zambezi river, became part of the periphery of the international trading system. Despite some basic similarities, there were important differences. Many of the captives were exported to the Indian Ocean plantation system, Madagascar and the Middle East rather than to the New World. There was also the very significant role of the ivory trade, and the fact that the far-reaching changes accompanying this involvement in international trade were compressed into a much shorter time-frame. Moreover, the level of violence that accompanied the slave trade was probably higher in Central Africa, creating unprecedented fragmentation and rural dislocation. While some Central African trading societies, or at least the dominant class within them, benefited in the short run through their participation in the ivory and slave trade, they ultimately became subordinate to and dependent upon the international trading system whose centres of decision-making lay outside Africa. 22 Several factors operated simultaneously to expand the slave trade during the first half of the nineteenth century. As a result of the resurgence of the plantation system in north-eastern Brazil and the subsequent development of sugar estates in Cuba, slave-traders in appreciable numbers from the West Indies and Latin America began to visit Mozambican ports where captives were generally cheaper than in West Africa and the limited British naval force far less intimidating.$^{23}$ Simultaneously, French planters on the islands of Bourbon (now called RØunion), Seychelles and the Mascarenes, as well as the rulers of Madagascar, intensified their demand for slaves. The most significant stimulant, however, was the development of clove plantations on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba shortly after the turn of the century. 24 Conditions within Central Africa facilitated the growing demand for slave labour. Bisa, Yao and Chikunda trade networks already linked the interior to the coastal markets of Kilwa, Mozambique Island and Quelimane. Despite their initial emphasis on ivory, the inland traders had always brought a small but steady supply of slaves to these international entrepôts. The use of captives as ivory porters facilitated the addition of a larger slave component without disrupting the commerce in elephant tusks.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

The more fortunate regions had quite a different appearance from the others: arms, textiles and domestic slaves were plentiful there and rare elsewhere. As we shall see, during periods of economic recession the Portuguese tried to monopolize the profits of the network by eliminating African 'middlemen', whereas during periods of economic growth most of the trade in the interior was carried on by Africans.\nDuring the nineteenth century, the network had to adapt to certain major trade cycles. Up to the 1840s the slave trade was by far the most important Portuguese-African activity. This last peak period was in fact the most disastrous in the history of the Angolan slave trade. It is estimated that from 1780 to 1830, between 15000 and 20000 slaves were exported annually from Central African ports (from the Loango coast to the south of Angola). Brazil was the main importer and Angola the principal supplier. It was Angolan slave labour that made it possible to expand the coffee- plantation economy of Rio de Janeiro and Sào Paulo in the nineteenth century. On the whole, the Atlantic slave trade, even the clandestine operations, died out in the course of the 1850s, although in the lower Zaire river area it survived outside Portuguese control until the disappearance of the last of the slave markets in Latin America towards the end of the i86os.\nDuring the remainder of the century, exports from Angola were limited to a few agricultural products (such as coffee and sugar) and especially, products obtained by gathering - mostly wax and ivory - though during the last three decades of the century a greater variety of exported products were gathered, such as wild coffee, copal, palm oil and, later, more import¬ antly, natural rubber."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': 'Viewed from a somewhat different perspective, the unequal value of commodities exchanged reflects the fragile position of the region within the larger international trading system. As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts.

But this does not mean that they were constitutionally incapable of giving up the trade, as Western supporters of slavery maintained. The continuance of the supply of exportable manpower from Africa can be logically explained in economic terms. That the distributors were black and the exporters white is irrelevant: it was a paying proposition, profitable to both trading partners, whose sole object was to make money. That was the situation at the grass roots. The continuance of the supply is to be explained in terms of the efficient working of an integrated system: and what Africans were resisting was the disruption of this system. For one thing, it would have ruined the established business of the distributors,$^{31}$ who had no other prospects, to say nothing of the chain of repercussions it would have set off on the social and political structure, both locally and further afield.

This also explains the fall in the selling price of exportable manpower: it was the market's defence against growing pressure from the forces of suppression.

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'Much the same doubts could be cast on another of the trade goods, guns.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well. In the 1840s the impact of such measures in Algiers was particularly great as the French strove to control cholera. 47', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'African reactions', 'content': 'placement of 1000 000 metric tonnes.

Plantation slavery emerged, either in the form of slave settlements in the rural areas managed according to customary law on the Guinea coast, or Islamic law in the Muslim areas, or approximating to American-type plantations in the Indian Ocean islands. With the increased use of people of slave origin as warriors and in administrative positions at various courts, it has been estimated that in many parts of Africa slave populations could range between 25 and 50 per cent of the total population.$^{19}$ Although there were examples of slave revolts, and the particular example of the Lozi who threw off their Kololo overlords,$^{20}$ generally the slave populations did not form a distinct class. The bulk performed menial jobs, largely as agricultural labourers. However the substantial groups of warriors and domestic slaves, and the significant few who rose to positions of trust and power as successful warriors, traders or administrators, and the variations in their fortunes and life styles, made combination as a class of slaves very difficult. Only in places like Old Calabar, where the slaves were permanently alienated, with little inclination to integrate them culturally, and with a tradition of competition among the ruling elite to show off wealth by the number of slaves killed in funeral ceremonies,$^{21}$ did the slaves in the agricultural villages combine in a secret cult to demand improved conditions. Elsewhere, the prevalent ethos was acculturation and integration into the society through individual households. While the degree of integration was clearly limited - as witnessed by the number anxious to be redeemed or, having been emancipated by colonial laws, who were anxious to return to their original homes - it was real enough to suggest that the dynamics of change in most of the African communities was the tension of age and sex within each household, and of status and competition for power between the lineages and kinship groups, rather than between broad classes in society.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'What then were the lasting effects in 1880?

You see this sounds something like civilization! At present the Governor of Lagos does not allow any Sierra Leone immigrants to go up to Abeokuta, but I assure you they are all thoroughly tired of Lagos; and should this restriction be removed they will emigrate by thousands; they would then form a very powerful body in Abeokuta, who might have a decided influence over the present weak Government there. This ought to be welcome news for the friends of civilization; but there are a few drawbacks which I should like to point out. In the first place, they all delight in polygamy; if I say all, I do not mean the few exceptions well known here; but that as a body of people they do so. In Lagos this game will not do; but in Abeokuta they speedily add one or two wives to the one they swore in the church ""to love and to cherish."" Thus we may get a Christian State ""à la Joseph Smith"" in Abeokuta. The missionaries do all they can to prevent such a state of things; but men\'s passions are too strong, and they have no law to help them. Secondly, they all love to keep slaves. If you ask them why they should keep slaves, they themselves having only escaped from slavery, they plead that it is impossible to get on without slaves in this country, and that it is only domestic slavery; besides, they do not whip their slaves as the Americans did."" And here I should undeceive those who want to defend this ""domestic slavery."" It is true the slave in Abeokuta is not ill-treated; with the exception that he can be sold, pawned, or seized for debt, he is very well off; but we always forget, how did he become a slave? Few people sell their own relatives; slaves are caught. Ask a little slave boy, ""Where do you come from,"" and he will tell you the name of a distant town where he used to live. ""And where is your mother?"" ""O, I don\'t know, she was caught by the ommo ogun, and carried away."" ""Where is your father?"" ""He was sold to the interior."" Thus many a slave has a glorious recollection of father and mother, brothers and sisters, who once used to sit in one and the same compound, until they were kidnapped one by one. A war in this country is only got up for the sake of catching slaves; it is a great slave-hunt, the warrior taking care rather to provide himself with ropes than anything else. To make prisoners does not exist in their language; they only catch slaves. It is a pity to see Sierra Leone people encourage and even join in such barbarous customs.—Yours, ONE WHO WRITES TRUTH.'}, {'id': 3180, 'article_title': 'Journey to Kumasi, the Capital of Ashanti.

The African tribes constantly make wars and raids upon each other for the purpose of making slaves, numbers of whom are cruelly slaughtered in what are generally called human sacrifices. These cruelties are carried on within easy reach of the British Government in West Africa, notably in the kingdom of Dahomey, which borders on the colony of Lagos. In the year, I think, of 1875, the late Admiral Hewett, then Commodore of the station, established a blockade of the coast of Dahomey in consequence of the ill-treatment of a British trader at Whydah, and made every preparation for an expedition to Abomey, the capital, which would have effectually broken the power of the savage despot and his chiefs. But the home Government promptly put an end to the blockade and all further proceedings, the consequence of which has been that the King has carried on his slave raids and human sacrifices without interference. The French have now stepped in where we refused to go, and will, I hope, before long occupy Dahomey and put an end to these brutalities. But those who, like myself, have served the Government in those parts regret that Great Britain has always remained content with keeping order on a long slip of coast, avoiding as much as possible all interference in the interior. The result is that France and Germany are now taking rapid possession of the countries behind our settlements, which means taking possession of the trade as well as of the honour of putting down the slave-hunting and sacrificing which are constantly going on in those parts.'}, {'id': 6117, 'article_title': 'BRITISH MANUFACTURERS IN AFRICA', 'full_section_title': 'BRITISH MANUFACTURERS IN AFRICA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/06_07_1891#article-0', 'issue_date': '06_07_1891', 'content': ""Mr. Alvan Millson, Assistant Colonial Secretary, Colony of Lagos, delivered an address in the Manchester Chamber of Commerce rooms on June 5th, on the Commerce and Industries of the Yoruba country.

During the past fifteen years its northern frontier had been constantly harassed by the inroads of the Mohammedans, who had made Ilorin their centre of operations towards the south, and by that renewed pressure from the north the inhabitants of Yoruba had not only been cut off from their former sources of supplies in that direction, but had also been forced to submit to the exactions and commercial blockade of their weaker kinsmen who inhabit the neighbourhood of the Gulf lagoons. These tribes, with true African blindness to consequences, harassed in every way the Yorubas in their efforts to drive back the Fulah conquerers, curtailed their supply of guns and powder, upon which their safety depended, demanded exorbitant prices for such articles as they condescended to allow them to purchase, and to the best of their ability revenged themselves for former oppressions at their hands.

The continual wars led to slave catching, and the result was that the trade routes to the interior were, with few exceptions, closed to traffic, and it was more difficult for a trader to penetrate beyond the coast line than for a Mohammedan to traverse the desert of Sahara.

Of these Captain Lendy has only fifty police with him at Falabah, but detachments have been left at Bafodia and Kimiki. It is expected that the frontier police will be reinforced shortly by the addition of one officer and a hundred men. Even then its number will be few enough for effective combination, as Falabah is 250 miles up country, and in the midst of turbulent tribes. The Merotays, who were defeated at Pambi a year ago, when Captain Lendy won his D.S.O., are in arms again, and have assembled at a town called Yana, are attempting to spoil his line of communication with Freetown. Intent upon that object they attacked Fafodia a few days ago, but were driven off, leaving thirty-three men dead on the field, while seventy-two prisoners fell into the hands of the Bafodia people, whose total losses were four killed and nine wounded. The Merotays, however, were not disheartened. Quite recently they attacked and captured another town close by, named Kadanou, and there they have erected a stockade to serve as a base from which they will probably attack Bafodia again, as the two places are a very short distance apart. Meanwhile fighting has been going on also at Kimiki, where parties of the Sierra Leone frontier police are stationed.

He has advised that an expedition shall be sent up to punish the offending tribes, but the Colonial Government is always slow to quell disturbances of this kind. If Captain Lendy's force now at Falabah should have to fall back, it must skirt the area of war at Kimiki in order to reach Freetown, and that would involve camping four days or more in the open, a prospect far from pleasant since the rains begun, and, with the chances of being harassed day and night by hostile natives.

Lagos has for many years had a large trade carried on by British and other European merchants, yet this did not prevent it from being at the same time the head-quarters of slavery in the Bights. At Whydah an extensive trade in palm-oil has existed since 1849, and yet slaves have been regularly shipped from that port up to the present day, and, as has been already stated, a cargo was awaiting embarkation there in December last. Nor is this difficult to explain; palm-oil, which forms the principle article of trade, is collected by natives, chiefly domestic slaves, residing at or near the coast, its weight and bulk preventing it from being brought from a great distance in a country where there are no rivers; and it is evident that it would answer the chiefs better to turn their labour to account in this way than to sell them for exportation, even were not the customs of the country entirely opposed to such a proceeding. There is nothing, however, to prevent the chiefs from purchasing for export any number of the slaves captured in the hunts which are regularly undertaken for this purpose in certain parts of the interior, and so legitimate commerce and the slave-trade may be found combined in any spot on the coast to which British authority or influence does not extend.\n\nThus the existence of the British settlements, and of the Republic of Liberia, has served to eradicate the slave-trade from all but one spot on the 1,500 miles of coast extending from the Gambia to Quittah; and the recent acquisition of Lagos may be said to have freed almost entirely from the curse the remainder of the coast; the two exceptions being the small spot between the Gambia and Sierra Leone, the case of which has already been referred to in the report on the latter colony, and a portion of the sea coast lying between Quittah and Lagos, immediately in the rear of which are the dominions of the notorious King of Dahomey.\n\nIt is well known that, from the peculiar circumstances of his country, this monarch is indebted for his wealth and the maintenance of his authority over his people almost exclusively to the slave-trade.

Our merchants have frequently preferred to listen to the wild harangues of men whose exaggeration was patent to all, instead of paying attention to the estimates of those whose accuracy could not be questioned. Some have rushed into the African trade without knowledge or capital, and by ignorance and rashness have not only lost their own money, but have caused serious loss to firms who were working on a sound basis, but in consequence of the competition of mushroom adventurers, had to trade at a rate of exchange which barely paid expenses, and even to retain their connexion with those who took European manufactures in return for raw produce, at an actual loss. These remarks, of course, more especially apply to the trade with West Africa, but over the whole Continent, wherever the British merchant has a footing, he has had to contend with similar difficulties, and to put up with foreign competition carried on in a manner that scarcely savours of fair trade. Foreign competitors, wherever English influence is paramount, have the same privileges as themselves, but directly British protectorate or colony is quitted (except in the Oil Rivers and the Free Trade district of the Congo State) they have to compete with hostile tariffs and duties. In the early days of commerce the West Coast was a happy hunting ground for the merchant who did not much care whether his cargo consisted of gold dust, ivory, or slaves for the plantations in the Western Hemisphere. Many of the ships which visited the coast seemed to consider all that sailed under a foreign flag as fair prize, and even failed to recognize the friendship due to a fellow-countryman. Chartered companies were formed by different nations, which did their best to prevent their unlicensed competitors from encroaching on their privileges; and when war broke out between their respective countries, were quite ready to join in the conflict. These chartered companies made treaties with the natives, and built forts and stations which became emporia of trade. On the Gold Coast these forts succeeded each other in rapid succession. Hollanders, Brandenburghers, Danes, Portuguese, French, and English, all possessed strongholds, some of which are in use at the present day. The solidity of the masonry, the size and design of these fortresses, show the importance which the traders of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries attached to this West African trade. Slavery was rampant, and it is almost certain that without slave labour they would never have been constructed.

Captain Elton\'s first batch of letters, dated February 10-23, relate to his visit to the Samanga district, and here he liberated 1,326 slaves, with the option of remaining with their former masters or gaining an independent livelihood by their own exertions. Regarding this district, he says that slave-holding and dealing in slaves are now so completely upset and pronounced to be illegal, and so severely do such transactions expose the Indian to direct pecuniary loss through repudiation on the part of those he may be doing business with, that a total abandonment of all commerce with the traffic must result if the present vigilance is maintained; for in such case the one tie between the Arab and Swahili and the Indians being severed, the latter in sheer defence is compelled to look for justice and protection to the British power. As formerly carried on, the Indian connection with the slave traffic was mainly represented by three classes of traders—viz.: 1. The Custom House officials, who received the duties on slaves, and were often willing partners in large ventures. 2. The well-to-do merchants, who advanced guns, cloth, beads, and money to Arabs and Waswahili, and also to the third class. 3. The smaller Khojah and Battiah speculators, who traded in slaves in the immediate neighbourhood, and supplied goods to Mrima kidnappers and other riff-raff of the Coast at an enormous rate of interest. Of these classes, the first is out of work, as no duty is paid on slaves, either to the Custom House, the Sultan, or the local authorities; and the wealthier Battiahs are now too fearful of detection to engage in such dangerous work as supporting the dealers. The second has suspended operations of late; but the third, tempted by high and immediate profits, continues operations on a reduced scale. As a specimen of the trade carried on by the third class, Captain Elton describes the case of a Battiah, who, during his temporary absence, had four slaves brought into Kilwa by a party of his own men (freed only a few days previously), and deliberately sold the whole four to a caravan leaving for Pangani. ""His defence,"" says Captain Elton, ""was that he gave his men cloth to trade for ivory only, and that, instead of obeying orders, they bought slaves, whom they sold to repay him for the loss of his goods. This defence was simply ridiculous. Ivory is not to be so readily purchased just beyond the town, and, moreover, the Battiah accompanied his men to the house of the public auctioneer, quarrelled over the price offered there, and subsequently sold directly to the leader of the gang, leaving the next morning, for a higher sum. Unfortunately it was too late to recover the slaves, but I inflicted a fine of 400 dollars, trying the case with assessors, one of whom was a prominent man of the offenders\' own religious sect.""

Boma and Matadi up the Congo, to which ports vessels from Liverpool are now plying direct, are becoming the chief ports from which produce is being shipped, and the facilities at these places are gradually drawing the ivory trade away from Zanzibar. On the upper reaches of the Congo, Tipoo Tib, who up till quite recently has been held up to execration as a slave-hunter, is now diverting the ivory which hitherto carried by slaves, was taken to Zanzibar and other ports on the East Coast. The Congo State has now its officials at the very spot where the Arabs collect the ivory. Instead of making raids on villages and killing hundreds of natives to obtain slaves to carry the ivory to the East Coast, the Arabs can now sell it to the Congo Free State at Stanley Falls, where a regular ivory market at present exists. The Arabs not requiring carriers have no need of slaves except for domestic purposes, and the terrible traffic is said to be gradually dying out. The road from the Upper Congo at Niangwe and from the Tanganika to the East Coast is a difficult one, and often ivory carried by slaves took one or two years to reach the coast by that route. In the neighbourhood of Stanley Falls the former slave-dealers are forcing themselves into a peaceful colony under Tipoo Tib, who has himself discarded his old slave raids and is employing his energies in ruling the people. It is the belief that the Tanganika-Zanzibar route will ere long be entirely superseded by the Congo route. This is the tendency at present, and when the Congo railway is completed the Congo route will be more availed of. Matadi can be reached by ocean steamers, and from Matadi, which is at the foot of the cataracts, the railway will start.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

The Earl of Dundonald was in the chair.\n\nCommander Lovett Cameron, in the course of his opening remarks, said the slave trade went on all round the continent of Africa, and commerce had gone on with it. Our trade with the West Coast of Africa had gone on since the time of the Tudors. For centuries that trade was in slaves, and its increase was slow; but after several blows had been struck at that trade—among others by the liberation of slaves in the West Indian Islands, in America, and in Cuba—instead of their being any injury done to our commerce, our trade with the West Coast of Africa increased by leaps and bounds. It was only in 1850 or shortly after that we attacked a great nest of slave dealers in Lagos, and in 1861 it was made a British colony. Up to that time there had been no trade there except in slaves; but last year the trade of Lagos amounted to £357,831 imports, and £538,980 exports. And yet only thirty-eight years ago that place was of absolutely no value to us for legitimate commerce. On the Gold Coast slavery had been practically abolished by the British Government, but yet there was a good deal still existing owing to the native customs of the people. Even if the export of slaves from Africa was prevented entirely, the internal trade in them would still be enormous.\n\nFormerly the slave trade was subsidiary to the ivory trade, but when porters were no longer wanted for the latter, the former remained, only the men were killed and the women and children carried away. It had been said that domestic slavery must be allowed, and that was a very difficult question to settle. In his opinion, we should, as in India, abolish the legal status of slavery, but should not rout out all the households where no complaint was made. As long as domestic slavery existed there would be a market for slaves. We must have nothing to do with slavery; while the slave trade continued it was impossible for legitimate commerce to go on as it should! If the slave trade were done away with, they would find that all other trade would flourish.\n\nIn answer to questions Commander Lovett Cameron said he had avoided speaking of the Germans for diplomatic reasons.\n\nHe had a plan for the total abolition of slavery in Africa, which he hoped to explain shortly. It was, in brief, to establish a barricade across the country by the way of the lakes, and to get authority to maintain order on that line.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, on February 26, presided over a large meeting, held in Exeter Hall, when two African explorers, Commander Cameron and Captain Hore, were announced to speak.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-03-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_03_1889#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'REVIEW.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Cooper—now the Nestor of the anti-slavery cause—renders an immense service to it by this, his last contribution to its literature.

Furthermore, they mention efforts by organizations like the African-Aid Society in promoting legitimate trade and commerce as alternatives, indicating a shift towards alternative economic activities by African leaders.

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.712, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'The West African pattern', 'content': ""Coast (now Ghana), though to a lesser degree,$^{16}$ and in Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) where the slave trade had been of such great importance that the local population might be said to have been effectively incorporated already via the slave trade. 17 A second major new product was groundnuts (peanuts), whose exportoriented production began on the Upper Guinea coast in the 1830s, and spread out westward to Senegambia.$^{18}$ Rubber was a third major product, although trade in it started much later and in part to compensate for the decline in the demand for palm oil.$^{19}$ The late slave-trade period and the subsequent expansion of cash-crop production in coastal or near-coastal zones in turn stimulated an economic expansion in the Central Sudanic zone of West Africa (livestock, potash, agricultural products, leather goods). 20 To be sure, not all attempts at creating new forms of cash-crop pro› duction succeeded. In particular it seems that direct European involvement was counterproductive, as in the failed efforts at agricultural colonization in Waalo between 1819 and 1831,$^{21}$ and in the various efforts in Senegal, the southern Gold Coast, and Nigeria later on.$^{22}$ It was not that European personnel began to loom larger on the African scene; rather, the important change was that Europeans were largely displacing African merchants from The shift from the slave trade to palm oil strengthened the hand of private as against royal merchants (R. Law, 1977) and increased the importance of the northern savanna trade, as it did for Asante (Ashanti). See J. F. Munro, 1976, p. 46. But most of all, it caused fundamental changes more in the production than in the commercial arena.

France imported an average of 4000 tonnes a year between 1847 and 1856 and 2000 tons in the following decade. She compensated by importing an average of 8000 tonnes of groundnuts a year from Senegal and the Gambia plus 25 000 tonnes of 'tulucoona' nuts for the manufacture of household soap; these imports were worth 35 million gold francs in 1870. Something that had long been an abstract Utopian ideal - an alternative to the slave trade, a substitute for trade in men - had at last materialized. It remained to develop production on an industrial scale; and this took no longer than it had taken the Cuban and Brazilian plantations to reach full production of sugar and coffee. The main producing areas corresponded to the best slave-exporting areas, from Dahomey$^{44}$ to the rivers of the Niger delta and Cameroon. One of the essential features of the changeover was that manpower was mobilized on land that had been internally colonized. This admittedly meant that production was by means of a form of slavery, but within an African social and economic context. In fact the energetic development of this economic novelty did not immediately disrupt the traditional economy: slave trade and oil trade co-existed side by side. A more extensive system of barter began to radiate into the interior. On the coast the same agents for the Western trade still kept their grip on the market: they understood purchasing, gave credit, circulated traditional currencies, and introduced metal coinage. The increase in the number of people competing for trade upset the internal balance and led to a realign› ment of forces.$^{4S}$ These economic changes were accelerated by religious and cultural factors causing distortions, which were never very far removed from politics, which helped, however, to put an end to the trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.697, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': ""the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation.

The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

Although it gave poor returns, trade other than in slaves developed in parallel and not in competition with the slave trade. The competition was between the Western nations, and they eventually arrived at an informal apportionment of spheres of economic interest to which African rulers did not object. France was predominant north of Sierra Leone and at some points on the Ivory Coast and in Gabon, where she set up Libreville in imitation of Freetown. 43 Americans and Europeans came to the coast and were tolerated in what was in effect a British economic enclave.

There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

Their learned observation endorses the popular view. But the proposition needs explanation. Humanitarianism is a Western ideology, and it is unlikely to have found any place in the minds of African distributors of the time - with very rare exceptions. But this does not mean that they were constitutionally incapable of giving up the trade, as Western supporters of slavery maintained. The continuance of the supply of exportable manpower from Africa can be logically explained in economic terms. That the distributors were black and the exporters white is irrelevant: it was a paying proposition, profitable to both trading partners, whose sole object was to make money. That was the situation at the grass roots. The continuance of the supply is to be explained in terms of the efficient working of an integrated system: and what Africans were resisting was the disruption of this system. For one thing, it would have ruined the established business of the distributors,$^{31}$ who had no other prospects, to say nothing of the chain of repercussions it would have set off on the social and political structure, both locally and further afield. In other words, so long as the barter system between the hinterland and the coast, and the coast's foreign trade, had no clear alternative to the slave trade, opposition by African slave-traders to its suppression was dictated strictly by the imperative needs to avoid commercial chaos.$^{32}$ The supposed complicity of the African distributors was no more than a reflex reaction to the immediate economic situation. This also explains the fall in the selling price of exportable manpower: it was the market's defence against growing pressure from the forces of suppression. The latter thus helped to contribute to an unsatisfactory situation. This argument needs to be modi› fied when the exportation of Africans to the north or east is considered. While the economic interests of the slave hunters and distributors are selfevident in this case too, it is hard to see what kind of economic compensa› tion accrued to the countries that were plundered.

The 'benefit' to the world-economy was essentially the surplus value produced by the slave minus the 'cost'. Once Africa was 'inside' the world-economy, that is, was producing on its soil commodities that were part of the division of labour of the worldeconomy, then someone who was a slave was not something else, for example a free peasant producer or a wage-labourer. Therefore, although the 'cost' of the slave remained the same perhaps for the slave-owner, the 'benefit' had to be recalculated from the point of view of the world-economy as a whole. The numerator of the equation had to take into account the 'alternative' accumulation from some other use of the individual. It may be that he/she would have produced still more net surplus value if not enslaved. Furthermore, and crucially, the denominator changed since the years of reproduction, formerly usually outside these calculations, were now part of them. Therefore, the net accumulation from the slave years was reduced while the net accumulation if not enslaved remained the same. Ergo, the calculus was less favourable to slavery, from the point of view of the accumulation process in the world-economy as a whole.\nNonetheless, it was not these changing economic implications of the slave trade that would have the greatest impact on Africa's future develop› ment but a more fundamental process that was occurring within the capitalist world-economy.

His report serves, however, to underline the serious problem raised by the revival of slave-trading on the East coast of Africa. During the period 1860-70, between 30000 and 35000 slaves arrived in the ports controlled by Zanzibar: some were kept on the spot to work in the clove plantations.

As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts. The extent to which popular discontent surfaced more frequently during the second half of the century suggests growing class antagonisms as did slave uprisings in Lozi society and on the prazos.""\nIn other instances trading interests, independent of the rulers, were able to dominate commerce and undercut the position of the political authorities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': 'Perhaps the two best examples of this power shift occurred in the northern states of Undi and Kazembe.

There the local matrilineages were able to gain control of the slave trade, at the expense of the royal family, leading to the rapid fragmentation of the state. 69 One by-product of greater commercial interaction was the substantial amount of cultural borrowing that occurred between different societies. The direction of change varied appreciably, depending on such factors as the nature and duration of contact between the trading groups and the host population. Where interaction was substantial, three broad patterns of acculturation occurred. In several instances, isolated bands of merchants and raiders became totally absorbed into the local society, as in the case of the Chikunda hunters, who were incorporated into Nsenga, Ambo and valley Tonga communities.$^{70}$ In sharply contrasting situations, the aliens profoundly altered the host culture. The Chewa subjects of Khota Khota, for example, absorbed aspects of Islam into their religion, adopted Swahili names, Swahili words and phrases, and underwent a major restructuring of their social system.$^{71}$ Similarly, many Yao traders converted to Islam and adopted coastal cultural patterns as a result of their contact with the Arabs. Their participation in long-distance trade also led to the growth of urban centres and the development of rituals and prohibitions designed to ensure the fidelity of Yao women while their husbands were in the interior, 72 suggesting that change also occurred as societies modified internal struc› tures to meet new external conditions. In addition to these two patterns of acculturation, there are indications that the fluid conditions facilitated the development of new ethnic and cultural groups. Several of the bands of Chikunda broke away from the decaying prazo system around the middle of the century and organized autonomous communities in the Luangwa valley. Attracting followers from a variety of disparate ethnic groups, they evolved a culture incorporating diverse Malawian and Shona institutions and values.$^{73}$ A parallel phenomenon occurred in the area of what is now eastern Zaire where the Manyema were transformed from a disparate band of slavers into a coherent social and cultural group. 74', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'The process of suppression', 'content': 'routes for the export and distribution of slaves.

Out of the twenty factories at Punto de Linha only one is there for legitimate trade, and that belongs to Messrs. Hatton and Cookson, of Liverpool.

Spain frankly recognises the position she has hitherto maintained as regards that slave-trade to be no longer tenable. We refer our readers to the exposé of the Spanish Minister to his Sovereign, and to Queen Isabella\'s proclamation which follows it. The slave-trade is really to be suppressed! It is to be declared piracy!! We think that this time the promise is something more than ""to the ear,"" and that the hope it calls forth will be realised. God grant that it may be so. We have waited long for this, but we were sure it must come; and, even to human reason, it could not have come more opportunely. Lord Palmerston, the great and consistent defender of the employment of a squadron for the suppression of the slave-trade, has been taken away from among us. Every one familiar with the political men and facts of the time knows well that but for Lord Palmerston\'s constant presence in the breach whenever an onslaught was made in the House of Commons against the position of the ""squadron,"" the works would have been carried, and our efforts for slave-trade suppression on the coasts of Africa would have come to an end. And anxious men said ""whenever Lord Palmerston dies, such will speedily be the result."" That event has occurred; and now, at the very moment, the force of circumstances has compelled the Spanish Government to face the great question of the African slave-trade, in a very different spirit to that which it had hitherto manifested with regard to it. There is a frank confession, that not only must the African slave-trade be put an end to, but that the whole question of slavery in Cuba and Porto Rico must be dealt with, or the dominion of Spain in those parts of the world will become a thing of the past alone, to the great shame and reproach of the Spanish nation. We look now, therefore, at the African slave-trade as virtually defunct. The slave-traders may destroy their slave-pens and barracoons in Dahomey, at the Congo, and elsewhere, or convert them into factories for legitimate commerce; and the whole Western Coast will be freed from the terrible scourge. And the results in Africa cannot fail to be rapidly important as regards the spread of civilising agencies. The blood-house has been built over the grave of the predecessor of the present King of Dahomey. Comparatively few victims will henceforth be required for sacrifice at Abomey and Cannah during the lifetime of the present King; and as there will be no market for slaves on the Coast, the King could no longer obtain a revenue for himself and his chiefs by any predatory excursions against neighbouring peoples and territories. It will be recognised at once that it is of no use to get slaves for sale if no one will buy them; and it will become imperative for the King to encourage agriculture and commerce in his dominions in order to obtain the revenue he requires. The same at the River Congo. There, too, the last great sticklers for the foreign slave-trade must succumb; and the natural resources of the country for legitimate trade must be in some degree developed. The slave-trade has created in those countries a necessity for certain supplies of European and other foreign articles. The chiefs and people must and will now have those things; and as they cannot be paid for in slaves, they must and will find some rich produce of the soil to take the place of human flesh and blood. We look, therefore, for great and important changes—for a great extension of legitimate commerce with Africa, and the spread of Christian civilising agencies among the people bordering on the Western Coast.'}, {'id': 4600, 'article_title': 'Imperial Parliament', 'full_section_title': 'Imperial Parliament', 'last_edit_date': '03-05-1883', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_04_1883#article-20', 'issue_date': '02_04_1883', 'content': ""Earl Granville: I am glad that the noble Lord has put his question to me, as it will enable me, I think, to put an end to misapprehensions which seem to exist, and which, to a certain degree, are shared by himself, as to this important matter: It appears to be supposed by some that Her Majesty's Government propose to give up a vast extent of territory which belongs to this country, with some vague hope that the Portuguese will furnish an obstacle to the ambitious designs of some other Power. The noble Lord is not misinformed to this extent, but even he has considerable misapprehensions on the subject. It is not so very long ago that the interests of Europeans in the Congo and other African rivers were centred in the desire of monopolizing the slave-trade. It will be a glory for this country that she took the lead in reversing this policy. (Hear, hear.) There has now been a great change in Africa. The discoveries of Livingstone, of Stanley, and others have given us a knowledge of the physical character of Central Africa, and of the populations which inhabit it, showing that there are great capabilities for the development of trade and those civilizing effects which are the result of commerce. The work of the Philanthropic International Association, in which the King of the Belgians takes a great interest, the mission of M. Brazza, the increasing trade in different degrees of the English, the Portuguese, the French, the Germans, the Dutch, and the Belgians on the Congo and its banks, are acting as a stimulus, and afford grounds why no reasonable endeavours should be neglected to insure freedom of commerce and navigation, and to anticipate possible jealousies which so easily check trade, and which, under the pretense of securing peculiar advantages to some, are really injurious to all. There is much now which is not satisfactory on the Congo. In those territories which are acknowledged to belong to Portugal, complaints are made of high duties, of a differential treatment of the foreign and Portuguese flags, of arbitrary fines, and of other vexations and great impediments to commercial intercourse. On the Congo itself the Portuguese declare that the slave-trade is entirely at an end, and there can be no doubt that it is greatly diminished, partly owing to the ceasing of the Transatlantic demand for slaves, partly to our efforts, and partly to a change of policy on the part of the Portuguese Government. But this is not in the least the case as regards East Africa, where we struggle at great disadvantage when trying to suppress the slave-trade, in consequence of the want of a proper understanding with the Portuguese Government.

The letters are grouped under the name of the country to which they refer. Eighteen letters deal with Africa (from which Egypt is excluded) and Arabia. Several British ships were on the East Coast of Africa during the year, and a large number of slave vessels were caught and condemned; and tables appended to the report give particulars as to the number of vessels and the number and condition of slaves caught by Her Majesty’s ships. To this part belong other reports as to the slave importation between the two shores of the Red Sea (under the heads of Turkey and Italy) and as to Zanzibar. Under the head of Egypt we find thirty-two despatches, many of which refer to the capture of slave dhows and to the reception of fugitive slaves on board Her Majesty’s ships. Several returns are added, some of which, by Colonel Schaefer, the head of the Department for the Suppression of the Slave Trade, are interesting. Thus, in April, 1886, Colonel Schaefer states that in six months thirty-six persons, many of them professional dealers, had been tried by Court-martial for buying or selling slaves; of these thirteen were condemned, four acquitted, ten were still under judgment, and nine were released for want of evidence. The report as to the progress of the Home for Women Slaves in Cairo, founded by the efforts of Mr. Clifford Lloyd and Mrs. Sheldon Amos, is encouraging. In May, 1886, 170 women had been received into the Home, most of them negresses, a few Circassians, and a few Abyssinians. According to another report, drawn up by Colonel Schaefer, in the twelve months previous to May, 1885 (that is, before the Slavery Department took over the working of the Manumission Bureaux), the number of slaves freed in Egypt proper amounted to 1,032. In the following year that number increased to 2,786, of whom 853 were the property of Dongola refugees. In 1883 there were thirty-two slave dealers in Cairo; there are now only four or five, and they only act as brokers. The Anti-Slavery Society called the attention of the Government in September to the alleged transit of slaves through the Canal, and, in consequence, a strict watch was ordered to be kept at Suez, and some of these despatches relate to the liberation of slaves at that port.

The only question in this chapter which gave rise to controversy related to a proposal to exact security from the chiefs and organisers of caravans as a guarantee of their taking no part in the slave-trade. This was obviously not feasible, as caravans seldom return to their starting-point with the same elements. They are renewed from place to place among the tribes they pass, remain often a very long time in the centre, and return to the coast at different points. Ultimately the obligation of giving security was confined to the case of those who had already been condemned for slave-trade offences.\n\nThe abolition of slavery in the American continent put an end to the slave-trade on the West Coast of Africa. In the East it is the existence of slavery which keeps alive slave-trade in the regions where it still prevails; and until slavery in the East is extinguished, slave-hunting will continue to drag on some kind of existence, however successful their efforts in Africa itself may be. **Chapter IV.** therefore deals with measures for the extinction of the Eastern market for slaves.\n\nThis is a task differing considerably from that of abolishing slavery in the West. It implies a change of social conditions which are deeply rooted in the polity of the peoples concerned—a transformation requiring time as well as a spirit of energetic interference on the part of the territorial authority—a spirit which is not inherent to the character of Eastern Governments.'}, {'id': 6125, 'article_title': 'The Royal Geographical Society and the Exploration of Africa', 'full_section_title': 'The Royal Geographical Society and the Exploration of Africa', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/06_07_1891#article-8', 'issue_date': '06_07_1891', 'content': 'selves only too ready to follow the example of England in the adoption of this shameful system of providing for the cultivation of the vast plantations in America, so it must be admitted to their credit have they seconded her efforts towards undoing the wrong which had been done to Africa during ten generations; with the help, too, of the great Republic of the West, whose boast it was that ""All men are born free and equal,"" though too long with a special reservation against the Negroes. So far as civilisation and Christianity extend, we find on all sides in this last decade of the nineteenth century that the slave-trade and piracy are bracketed together as common enemies to society, and to be suppressed at all hazards. But in non-Christian nations there appears to be an entire absence of this feeling so much in accordance with the idea of our common humanity; and it is on account only of the support which it derives from Mohammedan rulers and people, that slavery has not entirely ceased to exist. That as a system slavery is doomed, there can be no question: it is impracticable to convey slaves across the ocean, even if markets could be found; and it is only through Egypt and Arabia that it is possible to transport the natives of Africa into Turkey or Persia. Those routes will soon be stopped we doubt not, and then we trust we shall hear no more of those direful Arab slave raids which from time to time fill us with horror. Meanwhile the fact should not be lost sight of that Englishmen are pledged not to assist, directly or indirectly, in the maintenance of this iniquity: and therefore, however great the temptation or noble the motive, it is not allowable to buy slaves, even with the intention of immediately liberating the unhappy creatures.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

The demand for kola nuts was reported to be at all times considerable in Brazil, but in view of the slowness of the passage and the difficulty of keeping them in marketable condition, the value has at no time during the past six years exceeded £3,563, while in 1877 it sank as low as £304. Shea butter also, though exported to the value of £161 in 1883, sank in 1887 to £29. Among the imports from Brazil, the most important seem to be rum, cigars, and tobacco. The depressed state of trade in 1887 affected the branches of commerce upon which the colony depended; indeed, irregularity of communication has in the past given this trade a peculiarly unstable character. Placed on a firm basis, however, there would seem to be excellent prospects of a rapid development in the imports above mentioned, especially when it is considered that the market for imports from Brazil is already established in the colony of Lagos. These facts showed that it was worth while to consider the advisability of embarking upon this enterprise, and he took advantage of this opportunity to publish the facts he had put before them, which bore upon the subject, sincerely trusting that so important an opening for British trade would not be neglected. Another inducement for the establishment of steam communication between Brazil and West Africa was that the value of our possessions, in their work of development, must depend on their trade, which meant an open and settled interior. Cut them off from the interior, and they were cramped as regarded progress, and were occupied in struggling to meet the bare cost of administration; connect them with the interior and their future would be great and far-reaching. It had been questioned why West Africa had not made more progress in the march of civilisation. In the words of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton it was slavery that debarred them from acquiring industries; it was slavery which prevented them from exercising the virtues of foresight and prudence; it was slavery which left them nothing to care for; it was slavery that took away from them all the incentives to industrious labour, and debarred them from all the ties of social intercourse. When we remember the small percentage of people that represents owners, we had to acknowledge that these causes still opposed development. Time alone would rehabilitate the negro in his manliness. Obstacles that blocked progress were the altered relationship between owner and former slave, the independence of the latter when compared with his former grovelling position, doubt of result or use of independence secured with abolition, doubt in minds of native authorities of consequence of any action they might initiate, non-existence of free labour markets, and inter-tribal differences, jealousies and feuds. The removal of such blocks had been and was the aim of the Government, and they were gradually disappearing. In primitive countries such as within and adjoining our West African colonies, it was the duty of the Government to initiate the capabilities of the country represented by its products. The people were industrious in their own fashion, and were ready to follow examples set, and to develop industries once they learn to appreciate their value. We wanted new staples of trade and larger areas of demand for our wares. Agricultural products must long continue the most important part of the exports from tropical Africa, and the future development of Africa's commerce would depend upon the improvement in the quantity and quality of existing agricultural staples, and on the introduction of new products, which should serve as materials for manufacture and for use in industrial arts."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-12-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICAN PROSPECTS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'And now Portugal must—must put an end to the slave-trade from her East African possessions—or if she is unable to do so must be constrained to withdraw from the scene and allow some one else to do it for her.

This simply arises from the fact that the African is too lazy to work more than is absolutely necessary to obtain what he requires, or thinks he requires.

The Earl of Dundonald was in the chair.\n\nCommander Lovett Cameron, in the course of his opening remarks, said the slave trade went on all round the continent of Africa, and commerce had gone on with it. Our trade with the West Coast of Africa had gone on since the time of the Tudors. For centuries that trade was in slaves, and its increase was slow; but after several blows had been struck at that trade—among others by the liberation of slaves in the West Indian Islands, in America, and in Cuba—instead of their being any injury done to our commerce, our trade with the West Coast of Africa increased by leaps and bounds. It was only in 1850 or shortly after that we attacked a great nest of slave dealers in Lagos, and in 1861 it was made a British colony. Up to that time there had been no trade there except in slaves; but last year the trade of Lagos amounted to £357,831 imports, and £538,980 exports. And yet only thirty-eight years ago that place was of absolutely no value to us for legitimate commerce. On the Gold Coast slavery had been practically abolished by the British Government, but yet there was a good deal still existing owing to the native customs of the people. Even if the export of slaves from Africa was prevented entirely, the internal trade in them would still be enormous.\n\nFormerly the slave trade was subsidiary to the ivory trade, but when porters were no longer wanted for the latter, the former remained, only the men were killed and the women and children carried away. It had been said that domestic slavery must be allowed, and that was a very difficult question to settle. In his opinion, we should, as in India, abolish the legal status of slavery, but should not rout out all the households where no complaint was made. As long as domestic slavery existed there would be a market for slaves. We must have nothing to do with slavery; while the slave trade continued it was impossible for legitimate commerce to go on as it should! If the slave trade were done away with, they would find that all other trade would flourish.\n\nIn answer to questions Commander Lovett Cameron said he had avoided speaking of the Germans for diplomatic reasons.\n\nHe had a plan for the total abolition of slavery in Africa, which he hoped to explain shortly. It was, in brief, to establish a barricade across the country by the way of the lakes, and to get authority to maintain order on that line.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, on February 26, presided over a large meeting, held in Exeter Hall, when two African explorers, Commander Cameron and Captain Hore, were announced to speak.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-03-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_03_1889#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Letters to the Editor: The Arrest of King Ja Ja', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'SIR,—I note in some of the daily newspapers an announcement of the arrest of King Ja Ja, of Opobo, West Africa, by the British Consul, on account of his disregard of certain trade obligations. As matters have come to such a crisis, perhaps you will allow me to lay before your readers some details of the whole matter in dispute, by which they may be better able to judge whether such arrest was really justified by the facts.\n\nAfter the famous Berlin Conference of 1884, it was arranged by the British authorities that some one should be sent out to the Oil Rivers to proclaim a Protectorate on behalf of Great Britain over the whole district; and accordingly a gentleman was sent out as Consul, who was empowered to sign a treaty with the native kings and chiefs of the various places, of which Opobo, where Ja Ja is King, was one. One of the conditions of the treaty which Ja Ja signed (Article 6) expressly prohibited strangers going to the interior markets; this condition being further substantiated by a letter from the Consul to Ja Ja; the effect and intention of this being to secure that the European agents should only obtain their goods from the interior through Ja Ja and his chiefs.\n\nAbout two years ago, owing to the depression in the oil trade, some of these agents agreed among themselves that the price of the oil and other native productions should be reduced; and Ja Ja accordingly was communicated with upon the subject, and he expressed his readiness to accept their terms; but that the ""topside"" (a general term among the traders there, meaning commission) should be allowed to him and his chiefs, as before. This the agents would not agree to; they were willing to continue the usual topside to Ja Ja himself, but not to his chiefs. Ja Ja remonstrated with them, and pointed out that Opobo was made by himself and his chiefs. Immediately a white flag was hoisted in five of the factories, which meant that they stop all further business with the natives. One of the firms concerned refused to agree to this suspension, and continued to trade as before.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1887#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.624, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Produce Markets', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The year that has just expired has witnessed the continuance and, indeed, the aggravation of that painful depression in the trade of West Africa which existed in 1886. The average prices in Europe of the more important native products have stood even lower than during the previous twelve months, while the prolonged continuance of low prices in Africa has apparently disheartened the native producer, and tended to diminish the quantity as well as the value of his out-turn. In Europe and America an improvement has, it is true, occurred in the prices of a few leading articles of commerce, but no sign of such revival extending to the products of West Africa has yet been vouchsafed; and, while it is not forbidden to hope for better things in 1888, it would be imprudent of our readers to base their calculations on any material rise in prices, or, indeed, not to make the necessary provisions for a possible—though, let us hope, improbable—further fall. While this condition of business is doubtless felt more or less even by the wealthy European merchants trading to West Africa, the most deplorable results of the depression occur in the colonial centres, such as Sierra Leone and Lagos.

For the past few years, business, to be done at all, has had to be taken at constantly decreasing rates. Take, for instance, Palm Oil, which may be considered almost the staple commodity of the West Coast. We find that the present prices, as compared with those ruling even a year ago, show a decrease which is positively alarming: *Lagos*, which at the beginning of 1885 fetched £29 per ton, now only reaches £25 10s.; *Cameroons* and *Old Calabar* show a reduction during the same period from £28 10s. to £22 5s.; *Benin* and *Bonny* the same decrease; *New Calabar* has fallen from £28 5s. to £22; *Congo* from £28 5s. to £21 15s.; and *Irregular* from £27 to £21. The chief point to be borne in mind in this connexion is that we must not look for any great improvement upon the present prices, at least to anything like the old figures. The only thing that remains is to cheapen the cost of production, so as to be able to meet the state of the market; and it would appear that the only means by which this can be effected is in the introduction of improved means of transit. We hear of the formation of a syndicate to develop a railway in the Congo Free State, by which it is hoped and expected to bring the produce of that vast district into the world\'s markets, and in return to supply the ever-increasing demand for European manufactures which is sure to arise when once the development of the Interior takes tangible shape. Every well-wisher of Africa must hail this project with satisfaction, but the question will arise, ""Why should the West Coast settlements wait?"" Here we have not a prospective, but an actual present trade, which, although at present in rather a low condition, only needs careful attention and development, and is even now capable of an almost infinite expansion. Great Britain has a paramount interest, from an economical point of view, in assisting the West Coast settlements to develop themselves.

In several instances, they overstepped their authority and enslaved their own subjects or neighbours in order to main› tain the flow of wealth and weapons upon which their power rested. The Makua aristocracy pursued such a self-destructive strategy. Until the 1850s the Makua had been the principal exporters of slaves to Mozambique Island. One by-product of their predatory activities was a large-scale migration of the victimized societies. Faced with a diminished labour pool the Makua rulers began raiding each other and enslaving their own subjects in order to maintain the profitable slave trade on which they had become totally dependent. Within two decades the Makua were badly fragmented, leaving them easy prey to subsequent Portuguese invasions.$^{47}$ The AfroPortuguese prazero community exhibited a similar myopic desire for profits which precipitated the rapid demise of the prazo system. As in the case of the Makua chiefs, the prazeros violated their historic charter and began to enslave people living on their lands when they could no longer acquire captives from the interior. In reaction to these excesses the indigenous population either revolted and drove the prazeros off the land or fled into the interior, depriving the estate owner of his traditional source of tribute. The effect, in either case, was the destruction of most prazos by 1830, and those that managed to survive suffered from recurring famines that so debilitated the indigenous population that they proved no match for the attacks of the subsequent decades.

Such termini were centres of active transactions.\nA system of this type was characterized by increasingly marked contrasts between areas that monopolized profitable operations - centralization of large quantities of products, handling and marketing operations - and those where there were fewer opportunities to accumulate wealth. The more fortunate regions had quite a different appearance from the others: arms, textiles and domestic slaves were plentiful there and rare elsewhere. As we shall see, during periods of economic recession the Portuguese tried to monopolize the profits of the network by eliminating African 'middlemen', whereas during periods of economic growth most of the trade in the interior was carried on by Africans.\nDuring the nineteenth century, the network had to adapt to certain major trade cycles. Up to the 1840s the slave trade was by far the most important Portuguese-African activity. This last peak period was in fact the most disastrous in the history of the Angolan slave trade. It is estimated that from 1780 to 1830, between 15000 and 20000 slaves were exported annually from Central African ports (from the Loango coast to the south of Angola). Brazil was the main importer and Angola the principal supplier. It was Angolan slave labour that made it possible to expand the coffee- plantation economy of Rio de Janeiro and Sào Paulo in the nineteenth century. On the whole, the Atlantic slave trade, even the clandestine operations, died out in the course of the 1850s, although in the lower Zaire river area it survived outside Portuguese control until the disappearance of the last of the slave markets in Latin America towards the end of the i86os.\nDuring the remainder of the century, exports from Angola were limited to a few agricultural products (such as coffee and sugar) and especially, products obtained by gathering - mostly wax and ivory - though during the last three decades of the century a greater variety of exported products were gathered, such as wild coffee, copal, palm oil and, later, more import¬ antly, natural rubber."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo* Basin and Angola', 'section_title': 'Economic zones and trading networks', 'content': ""They set up trading centres (e.g. Lukolele), went down the river as far as the Tio markets on the Pool, travelled upstream into the interior, collecting ivory and slaves, especially from the Mongo.

Three large economic and cultural regions were centred on the roads leading to Luanda: the Kongo region with its 'Mubire' (Vili) network of tracks which passed through the Kwango chiefdoms (especially Holo) and Encoge, an Angolan fortified outpost; the region comprising the western Lunda states, reached either by crossing the territory of the Imbangala of Kassanje and passing through Ambaca, another Angolan outpost, or by travelling through the Songo and Pungo Andongo country; finally, the Ovimbundu region, which maintained regular contacts with Pungo Andongo and the other Angolan posts in the Kwanza valley. The Ovimbundu highlands were linked to the coast by another route that led to Caconda and Benguela.

An 1899 government commission, whose task it was to analyse the prospects for development in Angola and Mozambique, had been unequivocal on this last point: We need native labour, we need it in order to better the conditions of these labourers, we need it for the economy of Europe and for the progress of Africa. Our tropical Africa will not grow without the Africans. The capital needed to exploit it, and it so needs to be exploited, lies in the procurement of labour for exploitation.

Many peasants were able to circumvent the labour requirement by cultivating new or additional cash crops to pay their taxes.

Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa.

The legal basis for forced labour which was to continue under varying guises until 1961, was delineated in Article 1: All native inhabitants of the Portuguese overseas are subject to the moral and legal obligations to seek to acquire through work, those things which they lack to subsist and to improve their own social conditions. They have full liberty to choose the means through which to comply with this obligation, but if they do not comply in some way, the public authorities may force them to comply. 65 And force them they did. Local administrators had complete discretion to determine who was 'idle', and virtually all chefes des posto supplemented their modest salaries through gifts and favours from European planters, merchants, factory owners and farmers in return for African labour.

The trade was also fed from a host of channels that sluiced off slaves from peoples belonging to hundreds of chieftaincies, from the territories of the Tuareg to the areas bordering the trading posts on the coast. During the final decades of the nineteenth century, war broke out in virtually every decade and in virtually every region, and war meant captives. These victims were for the most part from sedentary agricultural communities, which served as a veritable breeding stock for the trade. Hence the underpopulated areas to be found in regions that were literally drained of their inhabitants. Tribute exacted in the form of captives was extremely heavy in many instances. When indigenous peoples took action to organize their own defence, they were frequently used as mercenaries in wars elsewhere, as in the case of some of the Gurunsi who fought in the ranks of the Zamberma, and the Samo (Sanan) who took part in the dynastic wars of Yatenga."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'The process of suppression', 'content': 'routes for the export and distribution of slaves.

Consul O’Neill, reporting from Mozambique, estimates the present export of slaves from the Mozambique coast alone at from 3,000 to 4,000 per annum. The cruisers on that coast are very active. In the four years 1876-79 they succeeded in freeing 991 slaves, and it is not their fault that they do not do more. When we glance at the area which includes slaving operations, and compare it with the number of vessels employed to check the slave trade, the difficult nature of the task is at once apparent. The total length of coast from which slaving operations are carried on may be said to be over 1,000 miles, and the sea area upon which British cruisers are employed is over 500 square miles. The work of suppressing the traffic is left in the main to England. The Portuguese are only spasmodic in their action, and difficult to move quickly when slaves are reported by our officers in their neighbourhood. They always let the news get wind, delay after delay occurs, until they arrive just in time to find the slaves gone. The Portuguese vessels of war are worn out or useless, and the French, as we shall show presently, hinder rather than assist in the suppression of the trade. As to other Great Powers, they do not profess to take part in the work, so that we have only to rely upon ourselves for all active measures. Yet the greatest number of ships we have furnished for service in these waters has hitherto been three, and they are usually the most worthless ships in the Navy. To suppose that the slave trade on the East Coast of Africa can be destroyed by means so disproportionate to the end aimed at is to credit English officers with impossibilities. We think but little of spending four or five millions, in another part of the same continent, in invading the country of a neighbour who has never wronged us; we spend double that sum without a murmur upon a fruitless march upon Coomassie; yet we cannot afford to substitute swift cruisers for worn-out hulks when the work to be done is the freeing of the slave! Nor must it be forgotten that, the more efficient the service, the greater the number of captures made, the more money goes to the Treasury from the sale of condemned ships. Even with the present inadequate force on the coast, the ships condemned involve payments to the British Navy, which, in the last four years for which we have the accounts, amounted on an average to upwards of £12,000 per annum.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-01-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_01_1882#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE SLAVE TRADE IN EAST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""_Lisbon._—News from Mozambique states that the Governor of the province, Councillor Cunha, had ordered the transport Principe D.

To those who know the nature of the trade there is nothing new or surprising in this circumstance. One sees upon the possessions of the Portuguese on the African coast many black men, both of whose ears are wanting. These are mostly slaves who, having attempted to escape by flight from the amenities of Portuguese civilization, are thus marked by their humane masters in order that they may know them again. Nine-tenths of the plantation labourers in San Thomé are slaves, the greater part of whom have been brought from San Paolo de Loando and San Salvador. From the latter place they were brought a year ago, chained together, and land route from Nokki to Mboma, and thence shipped to their destination. Now, however, owing to the Berlin Conference, the new Congo State has become closed, and it is probable that the dealers are obliged to seek their wares elsewhere, since the plantations of the convict settlements require a constant supply of cheap labour. When, in October of last year, we were in Banana, on our way home to Europe as passengers on the Portuguese mail steamer San Thomé, we saw on board the well-known slave dealer Rosa, with some thirty black men, who wore iron rings round their necks as which were their numbers, the greater part of whom were landed at San Thomé, while seven men were left at Principé. Rosa had been condemned to twenty years' transportation for forgery, but, by trading in slaves, he had accumulated in four years a fortune of 400,000 francs, with which, a year ago, he returned unchallenged to his fatherland.

It is written in an admirable and Christian spirit, and is indeed a very valuable addition to the public records of the horrible East African foreign slave trade. It intensifies, if such a thing were possible, the ardent desire we have always felt to get rid of the Portuguese, from the possessions held by them with great dishonour, and no national profit, on the East Coast of Africa. For although the slave trade from Quiloa and the more northern part of the coast, direct or through Zanzibar to the Persian Gulf, be, as we hope it will be, extinguished (for we do not see how Her Majesty\'s Government can stop short of this after what they have already done), the fiendish depopulating work will still go on in the interior, at the back of Mozambique, so long as Portugal retains her imaginary possession by ""a false and iniquitous claim"" to the sovereignty of a coastline of 600 miles, from Quillimane to Cape Delgado. But how is this cancelling of Portuguese claims and partial occupation to be effected? In the present temper of the English mind as regards national expenditure for Christian and philanthropic objects, it would, we expect, be useless to say, ""Buy them out,"" even if they had really anything to sell. But they have nothing to sell, unless an exemption of that part of Africa from the sickening horrors which their presence brings with it, and in inflicting which the Portuguese people, if not the Portuguese Government, are active agents, be a thing for a so-called Christian Government to sell. It is, we think, worthy the serious consideration of Her Majesty\'s Government whether something tolerably effective might not be accomplished against this Portuguese slave trade by their according to the powerful Arab Chief Monsa, who seems to be the actual sovereign of those parts, that recognition which we find it stated he claims as his just right, and for which he is ready to enter into treaty with the British Government for the total suppression of the foreign slave trade. The author gives evidence of a warm sympathy with the poor African victims of the trade he was occupied in suppressing—a sympathy which gives a great charm to his book, and which we have not always found in similar works; the loathsome and degraded condition of the poor victims having too much diminished the interest that ought to have been felt in them. We are not therefore surprised to find him writing with much earnestness on the subject of the future disposal of liberated East African slaves. The disposal of them as hitherto in Bombay, Aden, &c., he looks upon, and justly, as most unsatisfactory in every respect, whether as regards the poor people themselves, the countries for which they were obtained, or our own duty towards them. He shows the necessity of not only coercing, if necessary, the Sultan of Zanzibar and all others concerned in the trade, but of forming a settlement on the mainland, from and through which civilization and industry may spread through those countries now the hunting-field of the Arab slave trader. Darra Salaam is the position on the coast which he shows to be in every respect most suitable, and which seems to us also, by his report, to possess superior advantages to any other we have heard of. Should such a course be adopted and vigorously pursued, we might yet live to hear of a great and happy change in those countries which will have many valuable products to send into the European markets. We have not space for his suggestions and plans, nor would it be fair to the author that we should give them in detail; they will be found in the last chapter of the work, and as it is one without which no library Slave Trade and African shelf can be complete, we recommend our readers to seek them there.

At the present moment she possesses nearly a million and a half of slaves on her vast plantations, many of whom lead a life worse than that of beasts of burden. Brazil continued the slave-trade from the West Coast of Africa long after the treaty with England by which she was bound to abolish it, and there can be little doubt that many of the slaves now wasting their lives in the hard bondage of plantation labour have been imported since the signing of the treaty, *and are consequently held in illegal bondage*. It is pleasing to note that a strong abolition movement has lately taken place in Brazil, resulting in the freedom of many thousands of slaves.\n\nLet us now turn to contemplate the ""unhappy hunting-grounds"" of the world—the boundless blood-stained territories of the ""Dark Continent.""\n\nThe whole of the West Coast of Africa is now nominally free from the curse of the slave-trade, though slavery still exists among all the native tribes, and in the Portuguese settlements forced labour is carried on under *indenture*, which is a form little removed from that of actual slavery. Free settlements, such as Liberia, Sierra Leone, &c., have progressed considerably under the influence of commerce and free labour, and this progression would have been much more rapid were it not for the stigma that attaches to labour in all countries where slavery has been a permanent institution. On the East Coast of Africa the great island of Madagascar has cleared itself from the reproach of the slave-trade. The importation of slaves from Africa was put an end to by the late Queen Ranavalonamanjaka II. in the year 1877. With regard to the Portuguese territories in Africa (Mozambique, &c.), it is difficult to speak with precision. The authorities declare that no slave-trade exists, but the evidence of English officials and missionaries in Eastern Africa throws considerable doubt upon that statement. Zanzibar alone of all the Arab powers on the East Coast of Africa has cleared herself from the stigma of the slave-trade. The mission of Sir. Bartle Frere in 1873 paved the way for this movement, which was completed by the recent treaty between England and the Sultan.

Time was when the Portuguese flag waved over the greater part of the Southern hemisphere: now little is left of all that vast empire of three centuries ago. It is a curious and interesting fact that Angola has largely profited by the commercial disasters of the erstwhile Portuguese possession of Brazil. This ancient settlement in Western Africa was for many years the emporium of the slave trade with South America. Lying a few degrees south of the Equator, a well-watered country with mountainous elevations, the differences of climate between Angola and Brazil were comparatively insignificant. In both countries the coffee plant flourished without culture. The slave trade has been long since abolished. Portugal has lost its old dominion on the American Continent, but although Brazil has got rid of slavery and Portuguese control, her recent troubles have seriously endangered her position as the provider of coffee. In the recent Civil War the export trade was thrown into confusion. Forgotten Angola has found an opportunity to develop a branch of commerce which may prove more lasting than its old business in African muscle. Coffee exports have largely increased, and the prospects of railway development suggest a new era for one of the most interesting of European settlements in the Southern Hemisphere. Very picturesque is the account which Mr. Pickersgill gives us of this black paradise in the recently issued Foreign Office report. It is more than four hundred years since the Portuguese established themselves on the coast to the south of the Congo, where a fine harbour gives access to the great tropical region which extends from the Atlantic to the sources of the Zambesi. The founders of the South African Company may regard with some amusement the report on commercial progress and trade relations which have been going on for so many centuries, and will point to the fact that whilst in Angola rum is the great social force, and slavery is not unkindly thought of by the Native populations who supply the markets of the settlement, the modern settlers in Africa are devoted to the destruction of slavery, and have imposed on their traders strong prohibitions against the distribution of alcohol. Angola, however, is quite open to reform in the matter of rum. The great characteristic of the region is that the small European population have succeeded in establishing very happy relations with the inland tribes. One result of their long-continued activity as merchants and shippers on the coast has been that the populations from the upland plains come hurrying down to the shore laden with Native produce—coffee, india-rubber, wax.

L. Cameron, R.N., C.B. The Earl of Dundonald was in the chair.\n\nCommander Lovett Cameron, in the course of his opening remarks, said the slave trade went on all round the continent of Africa, and commerce had gone on with it. Our trade with the West Coast of Africa had gone on since the time of the Tudors. For centuries that trade was in slaves, and its increase was slow; but after several blows had been struck at that trade—among others by the liberation of slaves in the West Indian Islands, in America, and in Cuba—instead of their being any injury done to our commerce, our trade with the West Coast of Africa increased by leaps and bounds. It was only in 1850 or shortly after that we attacked a great nest of slave dealers in Lagos, and in 1861 it was made a British colony. Up to that time there had been no trade there except in slaves; but last year the trade of Lagos amounted to £357,831 imports, and £538,980 exports. And yet only thirty-eight years ago that place was of absolutely no value to us for legitimate commerce. On the Gold Coast slavery had been practically abolished by the British Government, but yet there was a good deal still existing owing to the native customs of the people. Even if the export of slaves from Africa was prevented entirely, the internal trade in them would still be enormous.\n\nFormerly the slave trade was subsidiary to the ivory trade, but when porters were no longer wanted for the latter, the former remained, only the men were killed and the women and children carried away. It had been said that domestic slavery must be allowed, and that was a very difficult question to settle. In his opinion, we should, as in India, abolish the legal status of slavery, but should not rout out all the households where no complaint was made. As long as domestic slavery existed there would be a market for slaves. We must have nothing to do with slavery; while the slave trade continued it was impossible for legitimate commerce to go on as it should! If the slave trade were done away with, they would find that all other trade would flourish.\n\nIn answer to questions Commander Lovett Cameron said he had avoided speaking of the Germans for diplomatic reasons.\n\nHe had a plan for the total abolition of slavery in Africa, which he hoped to explain shortly. It was, in brief, to establish a barricade across the country by the way of the lakes, and to get authority to maintain order on that line.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, on February 26, presided over a large meeting, held in Exeter Hall, when two African explorers, Commander Cameron and Captain Hore, were announced to speak.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-03-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_03_1889#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

Lagos has for many years had a large trade carried on by British and other European merchants, yet this did not prevent it from being at the same time the head-quarters of slavery in the Bights. At Whydah an extensive trade in palm-oil has existed since 1849, and yet slaves have been regularly shipped from that port up to the present day, and, as has been already stated, a cargo was awaiting embarkation there in December last. Nor is this difficult to explain; palm-oil, which forms the principle article of trade, is collected by natives, chiefly domestic slaves, residing at or near the coast, its weight and bulk preventing it from being brought from a great distance in a country where there are no rivers; and it is evident that it would answer the chiefs better to turn their labour to account in this way than to sell them for exportation, even were not the customs of the country entirely opposed to such a proceeding. There is nothing, however, to prevent the chiefs from purchasing for export any number of the slaves captured in the hunts which are regularly undertaken for this purpose in certain parts of the interior, and so legitimate commerce and the slave-trade may be found combined in any spot on the coast to which British authority or influence does not extend.\n\nThus the existence of the British settlements, and of the Republic of Liberia, has served to eradicate the slave-trade from all but one spot on the 1,500 miles of coast extending from the Gambia to Quittah; and the recent acquisition of Lagos may be said to have freed almost entirely from the curse the remainder of the coast; the two exceptions being the small spot between the Gambia and Sierra Leone, the case of which has already been referred to in the report on the latter colony, and a portion of the sea coast lying between Quittah and Lagos, immediately in the rear of which are the dominions of the notorious King of Dahomey.\n\nIt is well known that, from the peculiar circumstances of his country, this monarch is indebted for his wealth and the maintenance of his authority over his people almost exclusively to the slave-trade.

The internal slave trade also played a role in depopulating vast districts, with villages raided and inhabitants either killed or captured.

Similarly, Nguni dynamism was premised upon their ability to incorporate and extract surplus from their large pool of captives. 51 Allowing for local variations, a broad pattern of economic dislocation resulting from the slave trade is nevertheless discernible. The violent disruption of much of the rural economy, the export of many of the most productive members of the indigenous societies, the inadvertent introduction of highly contagious diseases, and the growing dependence of the Central African economy on the world trading system intensified the process of underdevelopment. It is true that this process was accompanied by the dissemination of new crops such as tobacco, maize, rice and cassava, the introduction of modest technological innovations like the Chikunda traps, granaries, and weapons, and the expansion of some local industry. But these were relatively insignificant developments when placed in juxtaposition to the economic retardation of the region as a whole. 52 Little needs to be said about the unprecedented level of destruction that While slavery had been a feature of many Central African societies before the slave trade, preliminary evidence suggests a growing tendency to acquire captives to extract surplus which the aristocracy used to maintain its privileged position.

First, the manner in which slaves were procured tended to destroy social and political structures. Social outcasts, offenders against the law, were sold into slavery. A few persons were sold in times of famine or for debt. But the majority of slaves were apparently taken by kidnapping, raiding and wars. The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda. Accordingly, the extensive influence exercised by the Aro over Igboland through its oracle did not become an integrative force.$^{9}$ The element of violence inherent in Aro addiction to the slave trade thus distinguished their influence from the earlier ritual influ› ence of the Nri people over wide areas of Igboland.\nIn the economic sphere also, the disruption to normal agricultural activities must have been considerable. In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars. The metal bars were turned into pewters, ritual bells, state swords, leg-rings, and other ornaments.

In several instances, they overstepped their authority and enslaved their own subjects or neighbours in order to main› tain the flow of wealth and weapons upon which their power rested. The Makua aristocracy pursued such a self-destructive strategy. Until the 1850s the Makua had been the principal exporters of slaves to Mozambique Island. One by-product of their predatory activities was a large-scale migration of the victimized societies. Faced with a diminished labour pool the Makua rulers began raiding each other and enslaving their own subjects in order to maintain the profitable slave trade on which they had become totally dependent. Within two decades the Makua were badly fragmented, leaving them easy prey to subsequent Portuguese invasions.$^{47}$ The AfroPortuguese prazero community exhibited a similar myopic desire for profits which precipitated the rapid demise of the prazo system. As in the case of the Makua chiefs, the prazeros violated their historic charter and began to enslave people living on their lands when they could no longer acquire captives from the interior. In reaction to these excesses the indigenous population either revolted and drove the prazeros off the land or fled into the interior, depriving the estate owner of his traditional source of tribute. The effect, in either case, was the destruction of most prazos by 1830, and those that managed to survive suffered from recurring famines that so debilitated the indigenous population that they proved no match for the attacks of the subsequent decades.

In general, with the exception of the USA, Afro-American populations either stagnated, or failed to expand naturally. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the slave populations declined at the astonishing rate of 2.0 to 4.0 per cent per annum, resulting in an overall slave population at the end of slavery which was far less than the total number of slaves imported to the colonies, a decline which could not be made up by the normal healthy growth of the free population.\nA few examples illustrate the general pattern. During the eighteenth century alone, Jamaica imported more than 600000 slaves. In 1838, at the end of slavery, the slave population was less than 250 000 and the entire black population under 350000. Saint-Domingue imported more than 800000 slaves during the eighteenth century, yet the slave population numbered a mere 480000 in 1790 on the eve of the revolution there.

But this does not mean that they were constitutionally incapable of giving up the trade, as Western supporters of slavery maintained. The continuance of the supply of exportable manpower from Africa can be logically explained in economic terms. That the distributors were black and the exporters white is irrelevant: it was a paying proposition, profitable to both trading partners, whose sole object was to make money. That was the situation at the grass roots. The continuance of the supply is to be explained in terms of the efficient working of an integrated system: and what Africans were resisting was the disruption of this system. For one thing, it would have ruined the established business of the distributors,$^{31}$ who had no other prospects, to say nothing of the chain of repercussions it would have set off on the social and political structure, both locally and further afield. In other words, so long as the barter system between the hinterland and the coast, and the coast's foreign trade, had no clear alternative to the slave trade, opposition by African slave-traders to its suppression was dictated strictly by the imperative needs to avoid commercial chaos.$^{32}$ The supposed complicity of the African distributors was no more than a reflex reaction to the immediate economic situation. This also explains the fall in the selling price of exportable manpower: it was the market's defence against growing pressure from the forces of suppression.

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'What then were the lasting effects in 1880?

His report serves, however, to underline the serious problem raised by the revival of slave-trading on the East coast of Africa. During the period 1860-70, between 30000 and 35000 slaves arrived in the ports controlled by Zanzibar: some were kept on the spot to work in the clove plantations.

These changes naturally affected, in turn, the culture of these three areas, and contributed to a sharper distinction and discrimination of each region's peculiar culture. 48 Part of this reality, of course, was the bewildering variation in the situation in which an arriving African could find himself. In the Caribbean, the Africans formed the majority of the population. The phenotype was self-evidently black. In the USA on the other hand, black phenotypes were a minority of the national population, however concentrated they might have been in some individual states. In parts of Latin America such as Ecuador, Chile and Argentina, the blacks had virtually disappeared genetically among the American Indian and European groups, illustrating a broad spectrum of biological intermixture. 49 Nor did the demographic evolution of the regions follow the logical pattern of relative participation in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The AfroAmerican components of American societies did not necessarily correspond to the proportion of Africans imported during the centuries of the slave trade. Brazil, for example, imported about 4 million slaves during the course of the trade, a figure which, as we have noted, was approximately 38 per cent of the trans-Atlantic trade.$^{50}$ At the end of slavery in 1890, Brazil had an Afro-American population of about 4 million, which comprised 33 per cent of the local Brazilian population and about 36 per cent of the total Afro-American population of the western hemisphere. The Caribbean region imported approximately 5 million slaves, or 43 per cent of the trade, and when the last Caribbean island to abolish slavery - Cuba - did so in 1886, the region had a mere 3 million Afro-Americans, which, while they averaged about 60 per cent of the local regional population, accounted for only 18 per cent of the total Afro-Americans in the hemisphere. The USA received about 0.5 million Africans from the trade, or about 4.5 per cent, but had an Afro-American population of about 4.5 million at the end of slavery there in 1865.

Plantation slavery emerged, either in the form of slave settlements in the rural areas managed according to customary law on the Guinea coast, or Islamic law in the Muslim areas, or approximating to American-type plantations in the Indian Ocean islands. With the increased use of people of slave origin as warriors and in administrative positions at various courts, it has been estimated that in many parts of Africa slave populations could range between 25 and 50 per cent of the total population.$^{19}$ Although there were examples of slave revolts, and the particular example of the Lozi who threw off their Kololo overlords,$^{20}$ generally the slave populations did not form a distinct class. The bulk performed menial jobs, largely as agricultural labourers. However the substantial groups of warriors and domestic slaves, and the significant few who rose to positions of trust and power as successful warriors, traders or administrators, and the variations in their fortunes and life styles, made combination as a class of slaves very difficult. Only in places like Old Calabar, where the slaves were permanently alienated, with little inclination to integrate them culturally, and with a tradition of competition among the ruling elite to show off wealth by the number of slaves killed in funeral ceremonies,$^{21}$ did the slaves in the agricultural villages combine in a secret cult to demand improved conditions. Elsewhere, the prevalent ethos was acculturation and integration into the society through individual households. While the degree of integration was clearly limited - as witnessed by the number anxious to be redeemed or, having been emancipated by colonial laws, who were anxious to return to their original homes - it was real enough to suggest that the dynamics of change in most of the African communities was the tension of age and sex within each household, and of status and competition for power between the lineages and kinship groups, rather than between broad classes in society.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The abolitionist period', 'content': 'Nevertheless, by 1810 the tide had begun to change inexorably for the American slave society. The institutions of slavery slowly crumbled from within and without. The curious combination of political freedom which gave white Americans a greater voice in their internal affairs, economic selfinterest, humanitarianism, imperial incompatibility, and the unquenchable thirst for liberty on the part of the enslaved, ultimately destroyed the American slave system.$^{44}$ The political independence of the USA after 1776, Haiti after 1804, the mainland Spanish colonies after 1825, and Brazil after 1822, gave a different complexion to the political dimension of the system of slavery and the slave trade, and had repercussions outside the parochial boundaries of each empire, colony and state.\nThe loss of the British North American colonies in 1783 and the termination of the British slave trade in 1808 affected slavery and the African in profound ways. The largest and most efficient supplier removed itself from the market, and began an intensive campaign to persuade other European states to follow its example. The British anti-slavery campaign sharply reduced the number of Africans taken to the Americas during the nineteenth century, although the total remains high. Before the trade ended in 1870, the pattern returned to that which prevailed during its first century.$^{45}$ The Spanish and Portuguese colonies again became the major importers. Of the nearly 2 million Africans who arrived in the New World during this period, more than 1.1 million (or about 60 per cent) went to Brazil. More than 600000 (about 31.9 per cent) went to the Spanish Antilles, with the greater proportion by far going to Cuba. The rest went to the French Caribbean, with a small number entering the USA.\nThe trans-Atlantic slave trade, and therefore the migration of Africans, responded to the expanding demands for a labour force to develop the agricultural potential of the new-found lands as well as the supply con› ditions for Africans in Africa.$^{46}$ Most Africans consequently entered plan› tation agricultural complexes in the Americas.\nBut since the plantation complex varied throughout the Americas the socializing forces within which the Africans and their descendants would mould their own American culture likewise varied.

The influence and progress of Sierra Leone began to have a beneficial effect in that region around 1830, but sporadic operations continued in the Rio Pongos and Rio Nunez areas until 1866-7. Between 1848 and 1850 independent Liberia sought the assistance of French warships against the international slave ships and refused to continue provisioning the slaving system, which was disguised as a 'free enlistment' system. The Ivory Coast and the Gold Coast had remained relatively unscathed by the illegal trade throughout the abol› itionist period: Ivory Coast researchers have shown that although some slaving activities persisted, they were not intended to supply the ships plying the coast but to meet regional or inter-regional domestic demand and there is evidence for this view in records preserved in the archives.

In some cases, the Africans were embarked on very large-capacity steamships; the Nordaqui, for instance, carried an unprecedented cargo of 1600 slaves. Nevertheless, the convergent diplomatic efforts and the coercive policies of France and Britain eventually succeeded in curbing the slave trade. Between Benin and Gabon a widely applied policy of concluding treaties and promoting land occupation projects had the effect of severely impeding the traffic in slaves.

At every difficulty we kick and complain. Instead of swallowing the bitter pill like men, we try to spit it out like spoiled children. Look at us now! We have drifted into a little war with inaccessible barbarians. Lamentable events have occurred. Not the sword of the enemy, but sickness and death, have dogged our footsteps. Many valuable lives have been uselessly sacrificed. The cries of the suffering, the anathemas of the bereaved, have made themselves heard. And how do we meet this visitation of retributive Providence in a country that we robbed of hundreds of thousands or millions of lives by the slave-trade, which we and others carried on there for above one hundred and fifty years, at the twenty-six slave forts established by Europeans on a coast line of only two hundred and fifty miles? Let us get rid of the thing altogether, is the cry. Because it does not pay—when we have done nothing to make it pay; because it robs us of lives—when we have done nothing to remove from it those things that are fatal to life; because we have not yet got money by our repentance—we fret, and fume, and kick, and rebel, and ""will have none of it."" But we cannot away with it. We cannot get rid of our disagreeable responsibility. There is what the heathen termed a ""Nemesis,"" but which we know better as Divine Retribution. We are told that, 250 years ago, those now protected territories contained a population of not less than five millions of people; that they were almost clear of bush or forest; were like a garden, and cultivated in every part. We and others set to work to depopulate them by the slave-trade carried on at those twenty-six slave forts. How well we effected it is established by the fact that, even now that the slave-trade has been discontinued there for fifty years, the total population cannot much exceed 300,000. As population disappeared, bush and forest grew up. They are created rapidly where vegetation marches with such giant strides. With such tropical bush and forest, with decayed vegetable matter poisoning every stream and watercourse, and fifty other sources of disease, a country must be fatal to civilised man. We are suffering now under those fatal influences. But again we say, we cannot therefore give up our charge; we cannot, as has been hastily suggested, give up our protectorate (unless to convert the territories into a colony); we cannot confine ourselves to certain points of the coast, and leave the remainder of the country to its fate. Our doing so would inflict lasting disgrace upon us, and we should be compelled by a cry of public indignation here to retrace our steps. For what would be the immediate result of our abandonment? The Ashantees would recommence forthwith the work of devastation, slaughter, and slave-catching, from which nothing short of our influence and power would ever have induced them to desist; and the population, except within range of the guns of our forts, would be exterminated. It is necessary, in all such cases, to look a position fully in the face; and doing so in this instance, we repeat that, barbarous though (the majority of) the people of those territories still are, and fatal as some parts of the country are in their present state to civilised life, we dare not consign those 300,000 to certain and bloody destruction. The Ashantees can bring fifty or sixty thousand men into the field for offensive operations; and without us and our influence and aid, and the prestige of our power, there is no possibility of a native organization capable of resisting such forces.

There was much ignorance in this country as to the amount of the slave trade on the eastern coast of Africa. So far as they were able to gather, about 90,000 slaves were annually exported from the eastern coast, and each one of these cost the lives of from five to ten others, so that from 350,000 to 500,000 might be said to be yearly carried off by the man-hunters in order to supply the materials of this system of slavery. He thought, if the country were to realise the amount of this grievous evil, it would not rest without taking more active measures to remedy the evil. It was not merely the misery of those who were thus sentenced to slavery or death, but it was far more the desolation which the system carried into Africa itself—to which he referred. Dr. Livingstone, a thoroughly trustworthy witness, said that when in 1851 he first went to the shores of Lake Nyanza he found cultivation carried on to a high degree. He heard cotton mills at work on every side, and saw the flourishing products of a man's labour everywhere. But ten years after, when the slave trade had been driven, by the necessity of finding fresh victims, to the lake, all that remained was a handful of people who fled at the sight of any stranger, fearing the man-hunters. If we neglected to check this slave trade on the eastern coast, we should abandon the work which our fathers had done, and to a great extent make useless the sacrifices they made. He was convinced that the people of England were by no means ready to do that. The reports of the committees already mentioned encouraged the belief that we might do much to sweep away this great evil. Much injury has resulted from the compromise made in order to obtain concession from the Sultan of Zanzibar, and we required now a treaty which should make absolutely illegal all the export trade from the Zanzibar territory, and a further treaty to fix a time when the system of domestic slavery in Zanzibar itself should cease. It might be argued that the Sultan of Zanzibar would not agree to such arrangements, as the great part of his income was derived from the miserable wages he received for allowing this traffic. But it could be clearly shown that he would derive more from lawful trade, because Zanzibar was well fitted to be an export trade for the best products of Africa, and between 1861 and 1867 the customs at Zanzibar from legitimate traffic rose from 245,981l. to 483,693l. With respect to the payment of 8,000l., which was suggested, it was proposed that half of it should be paid out of the home revenue and half out of the Indian revenue. Thus we might obtain the assent of the Sultan of Zanzibar to a treaty which would enable us to do away with this grave abomination. No economy was so bad as spending a large sum of money, yet a sum which was just short of effecting its object. There had been recently published in Paris a pamphlet which charged the English people with want of honesty and truthfulness in their alleged desire to put down slavery. A more ridiculous idea could hardly have been put forward, but it should make us more than ever anxious to prove our sincerity and earnestness in the work of extirpating this abominable trade. He thought that the aid of France, of America, and of other great civilized Powers, should be invoked for the destruction of this traffic. They should prove to other countries that they were not holding back, but that they were ready to stimulate the inertness of other countries, and spur them on to a sense of their duty. He trusted that England would never flag in her noble zeal for the extinction of the horrors of the slave trade.""}, {'id': 2862, 'article_title': 'Exploration in Central Africa', 'full_section_title': 'Exploration in Central Africa', 'last_edit_date': '05-14-1874', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/31_12_1874#article-16', 'issue_date': '31_12_1874', 'content': '\n\n""My Lord,—Since I last wrote from here I have made a successful voyage round the southern part of the Tanganyika, and have discovered its outlet in a river named the Lukuga, a little to the south of the group of islands visited by Captain Speke in 1859. I think, also, from what I have heard from the Arabs here, that the Lualabas is the Congo. My reasons for saying this are fully stated in the letter and journal I am now sending to the Royal Geographical Society, who will no doubt afford every information on the subject. One important fact (if true) mentioned by my Arab informant requires looking into. He said he met no English merchants, although he heard of them and of our men-of-war, as all the white merchants he met traded in slaves. This, if true, would point to the Spanish and Portuguese merchants on the Congo. Of the vast importance to the trading community of England of the Congo and Lualaba proving one, there is little for me to say, but I will glance over the principal articles of export. The Guinea palm extends, I believe, from the West Coast to here; india-rubber is abundant in Manyema; sem sem (from which much so-called olive oil is extracted) grows well wherever cultivated; the castor-oil plant grows almost wild; ground nuts the same; copper and gold are found in Katanga; cotton grows well, and of two or three kinds; coffee is reported to grow wild; ivory, it is well known, mostly comes from this portion of Africa; there are many sorts of fibrous substances which might be exported with advantage, and the various millets and maize grow in such abundance that they would form a profitable export; rice also grows most luxuriantly wherever cultivated. The only obstacles to a free water communication of which I know are the Yellala Falls and the rapids on the Lualaba, a short way above the Nyangwé; the Lukuga is at present obstructed with grass, but a way might easily be cut through that. The trade at present is, about here, entirely in the hands of Arabs, who, when in Manyema, live nearly entirely by plunder, and who take the wretched inhabitants as slaves to carry their ivory and other goods. The efforts of England will, I trust, be successful in putting down the slave trade by sea, but at present they leave untouched an equally crying evil, the internal trade, which is rapidly depopulating vast districts. In going round the lake I was constantly shown places where villages had been, and when I asked where the former inhabitants were, invariably received the same answer, \'Killed or carried off for slaves.\' The price of a slave is only 5 dolis (20 yards) of calico, while the hire of a passage is 5l from Unyanyembe here; so that it is far cheaper to buy slaves than to hire porters; besides which, no porters are obtainable in Manyema, and the whole trade there is carried on by means of slaves. The Arabs take with them a horde of Wangwana, or freed men, armed with muskets, and carry a few stores by means of domestic slaves; and the ivory, of which they obtain large quantities, is all brought by fresh-caught slaves to Ujiji. The numbers of Arabs settling in the country is constantly increasing, and they all have large numbers of slaves for domestic purposes, for cultivating their gardens, and for porters. Many of those employed as porters only receive rations whilst on journeys, and when not travelling have to live by plunder. Of the relations between the various tribes there is little to be said; the agricultural people seldom make war on each other, unless they get mixed up with the quarrels of the Arabs, to any great extent; the predatory tribes prey on all others indiscriminately, carrying off slaves, and murdering all who attempt to resist. The cattle they slaughter at once, and find a ready market for their slaves among the Arab traders and tribes with whom they are not actually warring. I am afraid that stopping the export of slaves, although it will diminish the evil in the districts round the Nyass, from whence Kilwa draws its principal supplies, will only exacerbate it elsewhere by causing many now engaged in that trade to settle in the interior, where they will become slave-holders and traders afresh. In conclusion, let me add that, in my belief, this internal slave trade will continue to increase until proper means of communication are opened up, and the country brought under the influence of civilization and legitimate commerce.'}, {'id': 5725, 'article_title': 'THE ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY', 'full_section_title': 'THE ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY', 'last_edit_date': '07-31-1888', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1888#article-3', 'issue_date': '01_08_1888', 'content': ""Colonel LAVIGERIE, who spoke in French, said that he addressed himself to Christian England, because nowhere could he find a greater respect for human liberty.

The infamous name of Tippoo Tib would always be associated with this work. Europe had recently divided Africa, where Belgium, England, France, Germany, and Portugal had obtained rights. By so doing, the Governments of Europe had also contracted duties to Africa. For over half a century Islam had invaded Africa, acting on the doctrine that humanity was made up of two sections—the believers, destined to command; and the unbelievers, destined to serve.

It was not only necessary to hinder the transport of slaves into Asia by means of cruisers, but to destroy the markets of the interior, or to render them useless, as Gordon wished to do, by establishing barriers against slavery, composed of natives led by Europeans.

He said he desired the upheaval of the whole of England on this question. England was stagnant upon it at present, but he trusted that there was a further opportunity given us most unexpectedly, by the presence of Cardinal Lavigerie, to help forward the movement. He appealed to them to use every effort to raise the opinion of the country upon the question.\n\nBishop SMYTHIES (Zanzibar), who seconded the motion, remarked that the slave ships were still active, and last year a great number of slaves had been rescued and set at liberty.\n\nThe resolution was unanimously agreed to.""}, {'id': 5780, 'article_title': 'The Suppression of the African Slave Trade', 'full_section_title': 'The Suppression of the African Slave Trade', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_12_1888#article-3', 'issue_date': '03_12_1888', 'content': 'A correspondent of the *Pall Mall Gazette* has recently had an interview with Commander Cameron, R.N., the author of ""Across Africa,"" who yearns for a return to the land of trackless deserts and unexplored lakes.

His purpose is threefold—to extend our acquaintance with and influence over the tracts of country about Lakes Tanganyika and Albert Nyanza, to scotch the serpent of slavery which is devastating districts once populous and prospering, and to promote British commerce. Commander Cameron is not the man to work at haphazard. He hopes shortly to undertake a tour of the chief cities of the kingdom to engage for this scheme the approbation and support of all classes. He has spent several days in Liverpool explaining to commercial men in that seaport the nature of his plans; and there he favoured a representative with an interview:—\n\n""Then perhaps you would give a brief outline of your project.""\n\n""It may be better first to mention what its object is."" The Commander here turned up a map of Africa, and drew attention to the chain of lakes, which, commencing with Nyassa, works upwards to a somewhat ill-defined point north of the Equator. He puts his finger on several portions of the map which represented districts that when he passed through them were remarkably populous, but were now without inhabitants, the people having been either butchered in hundreds or driven away wholesale for slave purposes.\n\n""Following that line of lakes and rivers, which extends for some 1,200 miles,"" continued Commander Cameron, ""you see occasional intervals of land. Now, it is upon the western side of that line that the slave-dealers, speaking generally, find their happy hunting ground; and, to bring their wares to a market, they must cross either the lakes and rivers by boat or pass over the intervening stretches of land. If only a system of patrols were established to cover that 1,200 miles of water and land, a tremendous blow at the slave traffic would be struck.""\n\n""Ah, \'if,\' you say, but \'there\'s merit in an if.\' Are you not rather assuming the whole question in your \'if\'?""\n\n""No,"" was the Commander\'s reply; ""I don\'t think so.

On land a line of small forts or strongholds would have to be erected, say thirty miles apart. That would be sufficient.""\n\n""But would not that leave plenty of loophole for a slave caravan to slip through?""\n\n""I think not.

That we, too, should have our Whydah so near that of the King of Dahomey, is too horrible to think of. For the sake of a few paltry hundreds a-year, this country, which is spending half-a-million annually on the naval squadron for suppressing the slave-trade, delivers over the people of an extensive region to this monster enormity. We called attention, some twelve months ago, to the active operations of the slavetraders at Quittah, since the virtual abandonment of that place by the British authorities. We stated then that many hundred slaves, from Ashantee and the Volta districts, had passed Quittah by the Lagoons and sea coast for shipment, at a place nearer to the King of Dahomey\'s port of Whydah, which our readers will see in our Dahoman news the King calls ""the English town of Whydah."" And now it seems that so far from anything having been done by the British Government to put an end to such practices, the trade has gone on constantly increasing, until it has destroyed the legitimate commerce which before existed, and which ought to have been fostered with the extremest assiduity and care.

We have by it become really implicated as a nation in that slave-trade which we are, at the same time, making such expensive efforts to suppress.

This trade, once inaugurated, was carried on by the Egyptians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and Europeans down to the end of the last century, when the revival of human feeling urged certain philanthropists in England to move towards the abolition of a great evil. But during all this period the negro himself was as much to blame as the white and yellow men; indeed, it was probable that negroes were enslaving negroes long before Egyptian or Arab bought black servants from the negro chiefs, and at the present day there would be no slavery in Africa if an approval of slavery were not present in the philosophy of the negro tribes of Africa. Slavery and the slave trade, with the tribal wars and their attendant insecurity, had been the cause of Africa's backward condition, and if ever that Continent were to be raised to the civilisation of Europe, slavery and the slave trade must be extirpated. The two great slave markets which, until a few years ago, had existed in America, and in Turkey and Persia rendered the inducements to slave traders so great that the guarding of the coasts of Africa by British cruisers only checked the trade in a very slight degree; and even now many slaves were sent to Arabia, Persia, and Madagascar. In the present day, however, Africa was the main consumer of its own slaves. The most remarkable revival of the slave trade and occurred in German East Africa. The Germans, under Major Von Wissmann, began by suppressing a revolt of the Arab slave dealers, which led to the almost complete extinction of the oversea slave traffic on the German coast of East Africa; but the organisation of a strong government led to the rapid settling down of the Arabs as great landed proprietors, with an unlimited number of slaves to work their plantations. Legally slavery could not exist in German territory, but in such a wide and sparsely populated region it was impossible to prevent it in fact; and as the slaves were ordinarily well and kindly treated, it never occurred to them to want to leave their masters or to better their condition. It might be asked where, then, was the harm of slavery? The harm lay in this, that slavery commenced with an initial evil. The speaker then drew a picture of the loss of life, devastation of countries, and breaking of family ties which attended a capture of slaves. This depopulation of whole regions was attended with another evil, the return of the dreaded tsetse fly; and the surest way of extirpating this pest was to encourage population in the fertile districts of Central Africa. They must not expect much from the people themselves.

It was a most distressing sight to witness the arrival of these poor creatures; and it is necessary to make a few preliminary remarks in order clearly to understand the difficulties with which the medical officers had to contend. The appearance of the slaves when landed was most striking. In some the expression of the countenance indicated sufferings, moral and physical, of the most profound and agonising nature. Others of them gazed vacantly around them in the most utter helplessness. Occasionally, among the newly-arrived groups all sense of suffering was merged in melancholic or raving madness. The wizened, shrunk, and skinny features were lighted up by the hollow, feverish eye. The belly was, as it were, tacked to the back, whilst the hip-bones protruded, and, in some cases, became the seat of foul, sloughing ulcers. The hand and skinny fingers seemed much elongated by the great and neglected growth of the nails, and they were so deplorably emaciated, that the skin appeared tensely stretched over, and tied down to the skeleton. The legs refused to perform their functions, and they reeled and tottered about from sheer debility. Their squalor and extreme wretchedness was heightened, in many cases, by the particoloured evacuations with which their bodies were besmeared. When large numbers of the sick were suffering from dysentery, the condition of the wards and yards in the morning was extremely loathsome. This was in a great degree unavoidable, as the sick were too weak to crawl from their mats to the commode, although everything was done under the surgeons\' orders to keep the wards as clean and wholesome as the crowded state of the hospital would admit of."" In a word, ""the moral and physical causes of depression were often so overwhelming, and so intensely concentrated, that the combination produced disease in such formidable shapes as to be beyond remedy. The mortality was consequently very great; many persons brought to the hospital in the last stage of disease died a few hours after their arrival; others even expired by the way.

It was hoped when founded that it would do good work in the cause of emancipation. The placing of steamers on the great lakes promised much, which, under proper auspices, might have been fulfilled. This Committee started with a capital of about £100,000; but now the cash is exhausted, and the work is not done.

The earlier explorers of Africa were consumed with a determination to leave the country better than they found it. But they have been followed by a different class. The adventurer has little in common with the martyr, and the German Anti-Slavery Committee appears to have been served by men of the former type.

Lagos has for many years had a large trade carried on by British and other European merchants, yet this did not prevent it from being at the same time the head-quarters of slavery in the Bights. At Whydah an extensive trade in palm-oil has existed since 1849, and yet slaves have been regularly shipped from that port up to the present day, and, as has been already stated, a cargo was awaiting embarkation there in December last. Nor is this difficult to explain; palm-oil, which forms the principle article of trade, is collected by natives, chiefly domestic slaves, residing at or near the coast, its weight and bulk preventing it from being brought from a great distance in a country where there are no rivers; and it is evident that it would answer the chiefs better to turn their labour to account in this way than to sell them for exportation, even were not the customs of the country entirely opposed to such a proceeding. There is nothing, however, to prevent the chiefs from purchasing for export any number of the slaves captured in the hunts which are regularly undertaken for this purpose in certain parts of the interior, and so legitimate commerce and the slave-trade may be found combined in any spot on the coast to which British authority or influence does not extend.\n\nThus the existence of the British settlements, and of the Republic of Liberia, has served to eradicate the slave-trade from all but one spot on the 1,500 miles of coast extending from the Gambia to Quittah; and the recent acquisition of Lagos may be said to have freed almost entirely from the curse the remainder of the coast; the two exceptions being the small spot between the Gambia and Sierra Leone, the case of which has already been referred to in the report on the latter colony, and a portion of the sea coast lying between Quittah and Lagos, immediately in the rear of which are the dominions of the notorious King of Dahomey.\n\nIt is well known that, from the peculiar circumstances of his country, this monarch is indebted for his wealth and the maintenance of his authority over his people almost exclusively to the slave-trade.

L. Cameron, R.N., C.B. The Earl of Dundonald was in the chair.\n\nCommander Lovett Cameron, in the course of his opening remarks, said the slave trade went on all round the continent of Africa, and commerce had gone on with it. Our trade with the West Coast of Africa had gone on since the time of the Tudors. For centuries that trade was in slaves, and its increase was slow; but after several blows had been struck at that trade—among others by the liberation of slaves in the West Indian Islands, in America, and in Cuba—instead of their being any injury done to our commerce, our trade with the West Coast of Africa increased by leaps and bounds. It was only in 1850 or shortly after that we attacked a great nest of slave dealers in Lagos, and in 1861 it was made a British colony. Up to that time there had been no trade there except in slaves; but last year the trade of Lagos amounted to £357,831 imports, and £538,980 exports. And yet only thirty-eight years ago that place was of absolutely no value to us for legitimate commerce. On the Gold Coast slavery had been practically abolished by the British Government, but yet there was a good deal still existing owing to the native customs of the people. Even if the export of slaves from Africa was prevented entirely, the internal trade in them would still be enormous.\n\nFormerly the slave trade was subsidiary to the ivory trade, but when porters were no longer wanted for the latter, the former remained, only the men were killed and the women and children carried away. It had been said that domestic slavery must be allowed, and that was a very difficult question to settle. In his opinion, we should, as in India, abolish the legal status of slavery, but should not rout out all the households where no complaint was made. As long as domestic slavery existed there would be a market for slaves. We must have nothing to do with slavery; while the slave trade continued it was impossible for legitimate commerce to go on as it should! If the slave trade were done away with, they would find that all other trade would flourish.\n\nIn answer to questions Commander Lovett Cameron said he had avoided speaking of the Germans for diplomatic reasons.\n\nHe had a plan for the total abolition of slavery in Africa, which he hoped to explain shortly. It was, in brief, to establish a barricade across the country by the way of the lakes, and to get authority to maintain order on that line.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, on February 26, presided over a large meeting, held in Exeter Hall, when two African explorers, Commander Cameron and Captain Hore, were announced to speak.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-03-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_03_1889#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.597, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'REVIEW.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Cooper—now the Nestor of the anti-slavery cause—renders an immense service to it by this, his last contribution to its literature.

This pamphlet throws a strong light upon a matter of which, perhaps, most people, even of those specially interested in the regeneration of Africa, have heard but little. The evidence now brought together goes to prove that in certain parts the wages of native labourers are paid, even in the case of mere boys and girls, in spirits, and that as a result, in some places, after the first hour or so, labour is unprocurable on account of the drunkenness of the people. ""The idea of drinking spirits is inseparable from the notion of European life in the ken of the natives. Owing to the relaxing climate of the rivers, there are few factories which cannot tell their tale of hard drinking and certain death as a consequence. But we are repeating an oft-told story, and those who read these pages have probably made themselves acquainted with the state of the West Coast in some degree. ... Competition is relentless; times are very bad; palm oil has fallen to a ruinous rate. But the degradation of the tribes of West Africa has reached a depth which is appalling."" Few men are more fitted to testify concerning the extent to which liquor trafficking with the native races of Africa has reached than Mr. Jas. Irvine, of Liverpool; and the following extract from a communication from him speaks volumes: ""It is very difficult to give you an account of the ramifications of the drink traffic on the West Coast of Africa—not because there is little to be said, but because it is only a repetition of the oft-told story in every part of the world. The extent of the trade is so prodigious that I think the following estimate of the quantity annually poured into the delta of the Niger relieves me from the necessity of further remark concerning this evil. ... I am sure I do not over-estimate the quantity when I put it down at 60,000 hogsheads of 50 gallons each as the annual consumption in the rivers."" We have in the native African one whose natural character is so weak that he easily becomes a victim when a dead set is made at him by those who are able to influence him. One needs go no further than the store-house of the first West African factory to know what is the native\'s weak point, and the form of the attack made upon it. His propensity to strong drink has been pandered to until things could hardly be worse with him. Mr. Joseph Thomson, the eminent African traveller, recently laid before the members of the Manchester Geographical Society his views upon this subject, and which fully support what has been already said: ""In the notorious gin trade lies a greater evil even than slavery. It is indeed a scandal and a shame. ... We talk of civilizing the negro and introducing the blessings of European trade, while at the same time we pour into this unhappy country incredible quantities of gin, rum, gunpowder, and guns. ... The trade in spirits is simply enormous. The appetite for it increases out of all proportion to the desire for better things; and, to our shame be it said, we are ever ready to supply the victims to the utmost, driving them deeper and deeper into the slough of depravity, while at home we talk sanctimoniously as if the introduction of our trade and the elevation of the negro went hand in hand.""

Additionally, demographic shifts and changes in food sources are noted without connecting them to environmental consequences, highlighting a gap in the textbook's coverage of the claim. In contrast, The African Times news articles offer several details supporting the claim. They describe how depopulation from the slave trade led to the rapid growth of bush and forest, as vegetation overtook previously cultivated and populated areas. This overgrowth, along with decayed vegetable matter, is said to have contributed to the creation of miasmas, posing health hazards. An article specifically mentions the Wassaw country becoming a dense forest due to depopulation, exacerbating the insalubrity of coastal districts. These observations from The African Times align with the claim by emphasizing the environmental and health impacts of the slave trade, reinforcing the perspective that it had profound ecological consequences in Africa.","The General History of Africa textbook does not provide direct evidence supporting the claim that depopulation caused by the slave trade led to significant environmental changes, such as the overgrowth of dense forests and the emergence of miasmas.

The Lozi aristocracy and landlords also used slaves to dig canals and ditches in order to bring fertile marshy soil into cultivation. By the last quarter of the century it was estimated that a quarter of the Lozi population were slaves. Similarly, Nguni dynamism was premised upon their ability to incorporate and extract surplus from their large pool of captives. 51 Allowing for local variations, a broad pattern of economic dislocation resulting from the slave trade is nevertheless discernible. The violent disruption of much of the rural economy, the export of many of the most productive members of the indigenous societies, the inadvertent introduction of highly contagious diseases, and the growing dependence of the Central African economy on the world trading system intensified the process of underdevelopment. It is true that this process was accompanied by the dissemination of new crops such as tobacco, maize, rice and cassava, the introduction of modest technological innovations like the Chikunda traps, granaries, and weapons, and the expansion of some local industry. But these were relatively insignificant developments when placed in juxtaposition to the economic retardation of the region as a whole. 52 Little needs to be said about the unprecedented level of destruction that While slavery had been a feature of many Central African societies before the slave trade, preliminary evidence suggests a growing tendency to acquire captives to extract surplus which the aristocracy used to maintain its privileged position.

The main sources of supply, however, were not only the great djihäd conducted by the Muslim leaders of the north and the conflicts in Mossi territory. The trade was also fed from a host of channels that sluiced off slaves from peoples belonging to hundreds of chieftaincies, from the territories of the Tuareg to the areas bordering the trading posts on the coast.

As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts.

First, the manner in which slaves were procured tended to destroy social and political structures. Social outcasts, offenders against the law, were sold into slavery. A few persons were sold in times of famine or for debt. But the majority of slaves were apparently taken by kidnapping, raiding and wars. The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda.

In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars.

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': ""Ironically, those rulers and merchants engaged in the quest for additional captives occasionally became victims of the political and social upheavals generated by the slave trade. In several instances, they overstepped their authority and enslaved their own subjects or neighbours in order to main› tain the flow of wealth and weapons upon which their power rested. The Makua aristocracy pursued such a self-destructive strategy. Until the 1850s the Makua had been the principal exporters of slaves to Mozambique Island. One by-product of their predatory activities was a large-scale migration of the victimized societies. Faced with a diminished labour pool the Makua rulers began raiding each other and enslaving their own subjects in order to maintain the profitable slave trade on which they had become totally dependent. Within two decades the Makua were badly fragmented, leaving them easy prey to subsequent Portuguese invasions.$^{47}$ The AfroPortuguese prazero community exhibited a similar myopic desire for profits which precipitated the rapid demise of the prazo system. As in the case of the Makua chiefs, the prazeros violated their historic charter and began to enslave people living on their lands when they could no longer acquire captives from the interior. In reaction to these excesses the indigenous population either revolted and drove the prazeros off the land or fled into the interior, depriving the estate owner of his traditional source of tribute. The effect, in either case, was the destruction of most prazos by 1830, and those that managed to survive suffered from recurring famines that so debilitated the indigenous population that they proved no match for the attacks of the subsequent decades. Fifty years later the Gwemba, Nsenga and Tawara rose up against their mestizo (Afro-Portuguese and Afro-Asian) and Chikunda overlords who had been enslaving them and exporting them to the coast.$^{48}$ } '' The Shona-dominated region, stretching from the southern margins of the Zambezi to the Inhambane hinterland, becariie a secondary source of slaves, as did the Delagoa Bay area to the south. Within this broad zone there were only small pockets of alien commercial penetration, most notably Chikunda conquests along the southern margins of the Zambezi river, and occasional forays by Portuguese and African traders linked to commercial interests at the ports of Inhambane and Lourenço Marques (present-day Maputo).

By the time Sayyid Said had transferred his economic interest to East Africa, the slave traffic to Mauritius had been reduced by British intervention and the island had even been taken over by them in 1810. But Seyyid Said encouraged the expansion of clove and coconut plantations in Zanzibar and Pemba. By the time he transferred his capital to Zanzibar in the 1840s, clove plantations were already the domi› nant economic activity and were mostly operated by slave labour. This created a class of landowners, originally mainly Arabs, but by the 1860s including indigenous Shirazi and Indians as well. By the 1860s it is estimated that the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba were absorbing about 10 000 slaves per annum. This was in addition to those supplied to other markets (largely Arab) abroad. It has been estimated that by the 1860s the Zanzibar market alone was handling as many as 70 000 slaves per annum and that the heaviest traffic started after 1840.$^{1}$ Although these figures may have been greatly exaggerated, they do indicate that the slave trade has increased tremendously by the middle of the nineteenth century.\nThe second commercial commodity exported from East Africa was ivory. In Chapter 9 we saw how its market was beginning to expand in the first decades of the nineteenth century due to increased demand in the industrialized West, apart from the traditional market in India. Previously Europe and the USA had obtained their ivory from West Africa. The demand for East African ivory, however, increased when it was discovered that it was of better quality (softer) and therefore more suitable for making luxury goods, such as combs, billiard balls and piano keys, which the richer classes were demanding. All British efforts to control this trade directly from East Africa failed because Indian merchants were already well entrenched in conducting the trade through Bombay from where it was re-exported to Europe. Only a few American traders were able to establish themselves gradually in Zanzibar as the most important Western traders, although they remained heavily dependent on the Indian merchants.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

In those parts of Africa where Africans were not allowed to grow cash crops such as Kenya and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), as Colin Leys has shown, 'within the space of a generation they had effectively been converted from independent peasants, producing cash crops for the new markets, into peasants dependent on agricultural wage-labour'. 27 Sixthly, the commercialization of land already referred to led to the illegal sale of communal lands by unscrupulous family-heads and to increasing litigation over land which caused widespread poverty especially among the ruling houses. In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo* Basin and Angola', 'section_title': 'The conquest of poor soils', 'content': ""Just as in other high-density areas, the transition to a more intensive type of agriculture in the nineteenth century was facilitated by the assimilation of immigrants and especially of captives taken during raiding expeditions into the lands lying to the south of the Ovimbundu highlands.

Millet and sorghum remained the staple crops, being drought-resistant. Royal power was closely linked to the system of production. The king was the 'rainmaker' and also responsible for sharing out the land and organizing river damming and other irrigation works. 13 As a result of such development, we can say that the long-standing disparities in population distribution were probably accentuated in the nineteenth century. The creation of a surplus from an increase in agri› cultural production led to relatively rapid increase of population in certain areas such as Ovambo, Ovimbundu, Luba, the whole area in Zaire some 5° south of the Equator, etc. This, in turn, led to migratory movements away from other areas. This was further heightened by the varying effects of social and economic factors. Some economic factors encouraged the practice of gathering, such as the collection of ivory and wax by the Chokwe and this promoted the dispersion of people in the forest.

On the contrary, ivory exports also increased substantially as African merchants tried to satisfy the new markets in Britain and the USA as well as their traditional Asian clients. 25 As the demand for cheap labour and ivory skyrocketed, Yao, Bisa and Chikunda merchants expanded their commercial empires. The Yao penetrated into the Lake Nyasa region during the first half of the century and, after 1850, entered the Shire valley in search of new markets among the Manganja and Chewa. Simultaneously, they established commercial ties to the Indian Ocean port of Ibo, which became a major export centre. The Chikunda, initially in the service of Afro-Portuguese and Afro-Goan prazeros, extended their commercial contacts from the area immediately north of the Zambezi to the Luangwa valley and south into what is now Zimbabwe, while the Bisa intensified their operations in the territory between the Shire and Luapula valleys. All three groups continued to emphasize the ivory component of the trade as well and in the case of the Bisa traders it remained the dominant export commodity. 26 By the middle of the nineteenth century Central Africa had become a major supplier of slaves. Annual exports from Quelimane to Brazil, for example, had increased by 400 per cent between 1800 and 1835.$^{27}$ The newly developed port of Ibo on Mozambique Island, and Kilwa, were doing a booming business, while the post-1844 resurgence of the sultanate of Angoche was directly related to its entrance into the slave trade, and even the southern Mozambican ports of Inhambane and Lourenço Marques, largely ignored by European slavers, became important sec› ondary entrepôts.$^{28}$ Zanzibar remained the principal recipient of these captives, with annual imports increasing from 10 000 per annum in 1810 to at least 20000 in 1850.$^{29}$ Paralleling this growth was a proportionate increase in ivory exports. 30 As the involvement of Angoche suggests, the economic pre-eminence of the Yao, Chikunda and Bisa did not go unchallenged for long.

Plantation slavery emerged, either in the form of slave settlements in the rural areas managed according to customary law on the Guinea coast, or Islamic law in the Muslim areas, or approximating to American-type plantations in the Indian Ocean islands. With the increased use of people of slave origin as warriors and in administrative positions at various courts, it has been estimated that in many parts of Africa slave populations could range between 25 and 50 per cent of the total population.$^{19}$ Although there were examples of slave revolts, and the particular example of the Lozi who threw off their Kololo overlords,$^{20}$ generally the slave populations did not form a distinct class.

Many valuable lives have been uselessly sacrificed. The cries of the suffering, the anathemas of the bereaved, have made themselves heard. And how do we meet this visitation of retributive Providence in a country that we robbed of hundreds of thousands or millions of lives by the slave-trade, which we and others carried on there for above one hundred and fifty years, at the twenty-six slave forts established by Europeans on a coast line of only two hundred and fifty miles? Let us get rid of the thing altogether, is the cry. Because it does not pay—when we have done nothing to make it pay; because it robs us of lives—when we have done nothing to remove from it those things that are fatal to life; because we have not yet got money by our repentance—we fret, and fume, and kick, and rebel, and ""will have none of it."" But we cannot away with it. We cannot get rid of our disagreeable responsibility. There is what the heathen termed a ""Nemesis,"" but which we know better as Divine Retribution. We are told that, 250 years ago, those now protected territories contained a population of not less than five millions of people; that they were almost clear of bush or forest; were like a garden, and cultivated in every part. We and others set to work to depopulate them by the slave-trade carried on at those twenty-six slave forts. How well we effected it is established by the fact that, even now that the slave-trade has been discontinued there for fifty years, the total population cannot much exceed 300,000. As population disappeared, bush and forest grew up. They are created rapidly where vegetation marches with such giant strides. With such tropical bush and forest, with decayed vegetable matter poisoning every stream and watercourse, and fifty other sources of disease, a country must be fatal to civilised man. We are suffering now under those fatal influences. But again we say, we cannot therefore give up our charge; we cannot, as has been hastily suggested, give up our protectorate (unless to convert the territories into a colony); we cannot confine ourselves to certain points of the coast, and leave the remainder of the country to its fate. Our doing so would inflict lasting disgrace upon us, and we should be compelled by a cry of public indignation here to retrace our steps. For what would be the immediate result of our abandonment? The Ashantees would recommence forthwith the work of devastation, slaughter, and slave-catching, from which nothing short of our influence and power would ever have induced them to desist; and the population, except within range of the guns of our forts, would be exterminated. It is necessary, in all such cases, to look a position fully in the face; and doing so in this instance, we repeat that, barbarous though (the majority of) the people of those territories still are, and fatal as some parts of the country are in their present state to civilised life, we dare not consign those 300,000 to certain and bloody destruction. The Ashantees can bring fifty or sixty thousand men into the field for offensive operations; and without us and our influence and aid, and the prestige of our power, there is no possibility of a native organization capable of resisting such forces. We have load enough of guilt already on our shoulders as regards that part of the world—load placed on us by our forefathers—without our adding to it by so horrible an abandonment to slaughter of the residue of their victims.'}, {'id': 993, 'article_title': 'THE AWOONAH WAR', 'full_section_title': 'THE AWOONAH WAR', 'last_edit_date': '11-10-1866', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_12_1866#article-9', 'issue_date': '22_12_1866', 'content': '**LATEST NEWS FROM DR.

Of late, however, tempted by increasing richness as they descended, they have, in some few instances, ventured as low as sixty feet—and at one pit, now in possession of Messrs. Swanzy, the Gold Coast merchants, as low as seventy feet. But these are exceptions. The general depth does not exceed twenty or thirty, for the reasons we have above given. Then, again, the country is not an open country, like California and Australia, and where abundant supplies of provisions for any conceivable number of immigrants could readily be produced or procured. The Wassaw country is a dense forest country, as is all the country between it and the coast. It was not always so, nor will it always remain so. It became so because of the almost entire depopulation of the country by the foreign slave-traders. Some millions of inhabitants were removed by slaughter in foreign slave-trade wars among themselves, or by deportation in slave-ships. The rivers and streams overflowed, and the exuberant vegetation of the tropics filled up the territory before inhabited by human beings. Since the suppression of the foreign slave-trade the population has rapidly increased, and with increase of population the clearing of forests will increase also. The exaggerated insalubrity of the coast districts, which in some places is bad enough, without exaggeration, has been chiefly owing to the depopulation of the country, and will in a great degree disappear as the country becomes more filled up. But although the Wassaw hills are healthy enough with ordinary careful habits, and will become healthier still as the forest land is cleared for mining purposes, it is evidently not a land for a ""rush"" of ordinary mining labourers, and their presence would do very great harm. There cannot be any profitable working, in a European sense, without machinery and a proper staff of management. The miner will have to cut down his timber and prepare it for his mining operations; it will not pay him to crush the ore in iron mortars by hand, in the native fashion; he must therefore have a steam engine of moderate power, both for working the timber saws and stamping the ore. Without these he would be in very little better condition than the uninstructed natives with their simple, inefficient apparatus. It is only by companies, then, such as the ""Effuenta,"" the ""African Gold Coast,"" the ""Messrs. Swanzy,"" and similar organizations, operating under skilled management, and with a moderate yet sufficient capital, that the hidden wealth—the rich stores of gold—so great that one fears to describe it as it really is through fear of being charged with wild exaggeration, can be brought to light and utilized for the benefit of those interested, and of the world at large, which is now craving (as Earl Beaconsfield lately showed in the House of Lords) a yield of gold, from some source or other, that shall bring up the present supply of about eighteen millions sterling per annum to the thirty-five millions at which the supply stood a few years since. So far as we know at present, it is only our long-despised West Africa that can make up this large deficiency of sixteen or seventeen millions a year. And we fully believe she can do it. Mr. Harvey, the celebrated Australian gold mine inspector, who has lately visited the fancied rich gold mines in India, forty or fifty miles from Madras, and pronounced unfavourably as regards them, has stated that ""Effuenta,"" every foot of which he knows, is ""full of gold,"" as is the entire range, including the African Gold Coast Company\'s lands, those of Messrs.

We know all that can be said about the absence of civilised self-control among the natives resident in and flocking to Cape Coast Town, and other towns for purposes of trade; but we know also how readily all these people accommodate themselves to unavoidable circumstances, and the restraints imposed by a competent and firm authority.

Abandonment because there may be a certain amount of individual suffering connected with possession, and, above all, when the causes which lead to that suffering are remediable and removable, is a new word for Englishmen to hear when uttered with respect to any legitimate possession of the British Crown. We owe, moreover, a great debt, not to the present inhabitants of the coast towns of the West Coast of Africa, but to the entire countries and peoples, which we with other European nations so grievously injured by participation in that foreign slave trade which led to the depopulation of vast districts, and their consequent surrender to the encroachments and ultimate domination of that wondrous tropical fertility which covered them with their present dense and almost impenetrable forests, giving rise to the miasmas inseparable from such a condition. Abandonment is impossible. Improvement is possible, and being possible ought without delay to be inaugurated. If the work be now commenced and steadily pursued, the late events, although they have caused an expenditure that ought never to have been necessary, will not have been altogether to be deplored.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Exploration in Central Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""My Lord,—Since I last wrote from here I have made a successful voyage round the southern part of the Tanganyika, and have discovered its outlet in a river named the Lukuga, a little to the south of the group of islands visited by Captain Speke in 1859. I think, also, from what I have heard from the Arabs here, that the Lualabas is the Congo. My reasons for saying this are fully stated in the letter and journal I am now sending to the Royal Geographical Society, who will no doubt afford every information on the subject. One important fact (if true) mentioned by my Arab informant requires looking into. He said he met no English merchants, although he heard of them and of our men-of-war, as all the white merchants he met traded in slaves. This, if true, would point to the Spanish and Portuguese merchants on the Congo. Of the vast importance to the trading community of England of the Congo and Lualaba proving one, there is little for me to say, but I will glance over the principal articles of export. The Guinea palm extends, I believe, from the West Coast to here; india-rubber is abundant in Manyema; sem sem (from which much so-called olive oil is extracted) grows well wherever cultivated; the castor-oil plant grows almost wild; ground nuts the same; copper and gold are found in Katanga; cotton grows well, and of two or three kinds; coffee is reported to grow wild; ivory, it is well known, mostly comes from this portion of Africa; there are many sorts of fibrous substances which might be exported with advantage, and the various millets and maize grow in such abundance that they would form a profitable export; rice also grows most luxuriantly wherever cultivated. The only obstacles to a free water communication of which I know are the Yellala Falls and the rapids on the Lualaba, a short way above the Nyangwé; the Lukuga is at present obstructed with grass, but a way might easily be cut through that. The trade at present is, about here, entirely in the hands of Arabs, who, when in Manyema, live nearly entirely by plunder, and who take the wretched inhabitants as slaves to carry their ivory and other goods. The efforts of England will, I trust, be successful in putting down the slave trade by sea, but at present they leave untouched an equally crying evil, the internal trade, which is rapidly depopulating vast districts. In going round the lake I was constantly shown places where villages had been, and when I asked where the former inhabitants were, invariably received the same answer, \'Killed or carried off for slaves.\' The price of a slave is only 5 dolis (20 yards) of calico, while the hire of a passage is 5l from Unyanyembe here; so that it is far cheaper to buy slaves than to hire porters; besides which, no porters are obtainable in Manyema, and the whole trade there is carried on by means of slaves. The Arabs take with them a horde of Wangwana, or freed men, armed with muskets, and carry a few stores by means of domestic slaves; and the ivory, of which they obtain large quantities, is all brought by fresh-caught slaves to Ujiji. The numbers of Arabs settling in the country is constantly increasing, and they all have large numbers of slaves for domestic purposes, for cultivating their gardens, and for porters. Many of those employed as porters only receive rations whilst on journeys, and when not travelling have to live by plunder. Of the relations between the various tribes there is little to be said; the agricultural people seldom make war on each other, unless they get mixed up with the quarrels of the Arabs, to any great extent; the predatory tribes prey on all others indiscriminately, carrying off slaves, and murdering all who attempt to resist. The cattle they slaughter at once, and find a ready market for their slaves among the Arab traders and tribes with whom they are not actually warring. I am afraid that stopping the export of slaves, although it will diminish the evil in the districts round the Nyass, from whence Kilwa draws its principal supplies, will only exacerbate it elsewhere by causing many now engaged in that trade to settle in the interior, where they will become slave-holders and traders afresh. In conclusion, let me add that, in my belief, this internal slave trade will continue to increase until proper means of communication are opened up, and the country brought under the influence of civilization and legitimate commerce.', 'last_edit_date': '1874-05-14', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/31_12_1874#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.629, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'REVIEWS OF BOOKS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'This is a most charming and readable volume. Professor Drummond is a clear and accurate observer, and has a real interest in the human side of African life; he is able to present us with pictures not often met with in books of African travel. The deadly nature of the tropical coast is forced on our attention, the uplands beyond this border rising from 1,000 feet to 2,000 feet, and the high table-land of the interior 4,000 feet to 6,000 feet, where the fervour of the sun is so modified that even the European, with care, may lead a healthy life. A subject on which Mr. Drummond takes a somewhat original view is the capacity of the native African for labour. He gives pictures of the ordinary life of the African. He has never had any need nor any stimulus to hard work; he has no more conception of that than he has of purity. But that he cannot be trained to appreciate both Mr. Drummond strenuously combats. As to hard work, conducted with method and effect, he points to the road between Nyassa and Tanganyika, made entirely by native labour, under European superintendence. Then we have the plantations around Lake Nyassa, manned by natives. About these facts there can be no doubt. But it must be remembered that these natives have been in the hands of the all-patient missionary, or of men deeply imbued with the missionary spirit. The mere trader, of whatever nationality, has no such patience; he looks for immediate results and high dividends, and solves the difficulty by ""contract labour."" The cruelties of the African slave raids Mr. Drummond brings out with saddening realism. One of his maps shows the great areas which have been laid waste by the slaving Arabs and the vast regions which still form their hunting grounds. We are frequently told of the rapid extinction of the elephant and the exhaustion of our supply of ivory. That is certain, and Mr. Drummond states that the event will happen within comparatively few years. But he does not lament the extinction of so fine an animal, even although it has never yet been trained to useful work. The fact is that ivory and slave-raiding are intimately associated in Africa. For every tusk obtained, a slave must be begged, borrowed, or stolen to carry it. And until the supply is exhausted, attention will never be given to the other more permanent resources of the continent. So the sooner the elephant is extinct, the better, he thinks, it will be for Africa. Mr. Drummond\'s chapter on the white ant will be found especially interesting even to those who are not naturalists; while the maps—six in all—which serve to illustrate ""Tropical Africa,"" give one an excellent idea of the physical and political condition of Central Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1888#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.627, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East and Central Africa Foreign Slave Trade', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sometimes the wind causes the mouths of the wells to be filled with sand.

His servants, who had drawn water from this spring, without observing it, carried off in the bucket the skull of a man. These human skeletons, mingled as they are with the bones of the lower animals, are the remains of slaves.\n\nOn leaving these frightful solitudes, where man is proved to be more merciless than the desert, reaching the zone of the forests, the eye is rejoiced at the sight of rich vegetation, flowers and lakes, these latter giving to the soil an endless source of fertility.\n\nBut in the midst of Nature, which God has made so rich, sorrowful reflections come over the mind. This privileged land is the theatre of slavery, and the home of the man-hunter. The large city of Kouka, in the vicinity of Lake Tchad, the capital of Bornou, is one of the greatest marts for this human merchandise.\n\nOn the Square, the best adapted for the slave-markets, one is sure every day to find several hundreds; but on Monday, the great sale day, they may be numbered by thousands; the blacks are there exhibited in their pitiable plight, partially covered with miserable tatters. The wholesale merchants and connoisseurs have no need to be attracted by a more delicate exposition, such as that which one would meet with in a retail purchase.\n\nThe slave is examined with care, taking measure of his height, opening his mouth, counting his teeth, asking questions about his appetite, &c., &c. The price demanded is according to his age, strength and colour of the prisoner, and varies from half a sovereign to five pounds for the current merchandise. Is this all that a man is worth, and is this the estimate put on human liberty? There are other markets at which the slave is considered of still less value.\n\nBut whence come all these wretched beings? It is here that the Eastern traffic is presented to us under a particular aspect, such as it did not assume on the western coasts of Africa in the organised commerce of slaves. Man-hunting, which supplies the victims for these markets, is not only encouraged by the brutal ferocity of the chief of a tribe; it is considered an act commanded by religion.\n\nThe Sultan, who goes to make razzias at the head of warriors, with whom he divides the booty, by an impious aberration believes that he performs a pious work in spreading devastation around him.

It was a most distressing sight to witness the arrival of these poor creatures; and it is necessary to make a few preliminary remarks in order clearly to understand the difficulties with which the medical officers had to contend. The appearance of the slaves when landed was most striking. In some the expression of the countenance indicated sufferings, moral and physical, of the most profound and agonising nature. Others of them gazed vacantly around them in the most utter helplessness. Occasionally, among the newly-arrived groups all sense of suffering was merged in melancholic or raving madness. The wizened, shrunk, and skinny features were lighted up by the hollow, feverish eye. The belly was, as it were, tacked to the back, whilst the hip-bones protruded, and, in some cases, became the seat of foul, sloughing ulcers. The hand and skinny fingers seemed much elongated by the great and neglected growth of the nails, and they were so deplorably emaciated, that the skin appeared tensely stretched over, and tied down to the skeleton. The legs refused to perform their functions, and they reeled and tottered about from sheer debility. Their squalor and extreme wretchedness was heightened, in many cases, by the particoloured evacuations with which their bodies were besmeared. When large numbers of the sick were suffering from dysentery, the condition of the wards and yards in the morning was extremely loathsome. This was in a great degree unavoidable, as the sick were too weak to crawl from their mats to the commode, although everything was done under the surgeons\' orders to keep the wards as clean and wholesome as the crowded state of the hospital would admit of."" In a word, ""the moral and physical causes of depression were often so overwhelming, and so intensely concentrated, that the combination produced disease in such formidable shapes as to be beyond remedy. The mortality was consequently very great; many persons brought to the hospital in the last stage of disease died a few hours after their arrival; others even expired by the way. A large proportion died within a few days; and as the names of all these persons were recorded in the hospital books, the percentage of deaths was thereby largely increased.""\n\n*(To be continued.)*', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.606, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Alleged Atrocities in the Congo Free State', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A recent number of the Sierra Leone *Weekly News* stated that the men from Sierra Leone and others who have ventured into the service of the Congo Free State are suffering terribly at the hands of their employers, who illuse them, break their engagements, intercept their communications with Sierra Leone, and, in a word, use them as slaves.

Boma and Matadi up the Congo, to which ports vessels from Liverpool are now plying direct, are becoming the chief ports from which produce is being shipped, and the facilities at these places are gradually drawing the ivory trade away from Zanzibar. On the upper reaches of the Congo, Tipoo Tib, who up till quite recently has been held up to execration as a slave-hunter, is now diverting the ivory which hitherto carried by slaves, was taken to Zanzibar and other ports on the East Coast. The Congo State has now its officials at the very spot where the Arabs collect the ivory. Instead of making raids on villages and killing hundreds of natives to obtain slaves to carry the ivory to the East Coast, the Arabs can now sell it to the Congo Free State at Stanley Falls, where a regular ivory market at present exists. The Arabs not requiring carriers have no need of slaves except for domestic purposes, and the terrible traffic is said to be gradually dying out. The road from the Upper Congo at Niangwe and from the Tanganika to the East Coast is a difficult one, and often ivory carried by slaves took one or two years to reach the coast by that route. In the neighbourhood of Stanley Falls the former slave-dealers are forcing themselves into a peaceful colony under Tipoo Tib, who has himself discarded his old slave raids and is employing his energies in ruling the people. It is the belief that the Tanganika-Zanzibar route will ere long be entirely superseded by the Congo route. This is the tendency at present, and when the Congo railway is completed the Congo route will be more availed of. Matadi can be reached by ocean steamers, and from Matadi, which is at the foot of the cataracts, the railway will start. Belgian, French, and Dutch houses are now established at Stanley Pool and are buying the ivory, which formerly found its way by caravans to the Angola Coast.\n\nA magnificent river, running parallel with and to the west of the Congo, has lately been discovered.

The Lomami will allow of the navigable Congo system being brought into direct communication with Niangwe, the chief Arab settlement on the High Congo, the Uangolle Lomami being only at a distance of three days' march from that town. The communication between Niangwe and Stanley Falls by the Congo is almost impossible, owing to the many falls and rapids; and the Lomami will form a further means of extending protection and bringing civilisation to regions which have suffered much from the Arab raids for slaves."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'WEST AFRICAN FORESTS AND TIMBER', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. C. F. Scott-Elliot, who was with the Anglo-French Delimitation Commission in Sierra Leone, in his report on the botany and geology of the districts visited by the Commission, states that most of the forest in the immediate neighbourhood of Sierra Leone was cut down for export many years ago in the period during which the timber trade was one of the most important industries. Even now, however, there is a good deal of virgin forest, with much valuable timber in the more distant parts. From the top of the Sugar Loaf, every mountain visible seems to be covered with forest, which, from the dark green tints of the foliage, appears to have been never interfered with. When, however, one goes into any of the numerous valleys amongst these hills, one sees that the cultivation is being carried on along the lower levels and is also creeping up the sides of the hills themselves. Moreover, after an altitude of 2,000ft. has been reached, the forest has rather a stunted and dwarfed appearance. Large trees are the exception; most have a diameter of 9in. to 1ft. only, and some are mere shrubs, and commercially useless. Probably also the really valuable woods are nearly extinct, though on this point Mr. Elliot cannot speak with any certainty. If one considers the preceding facts (the clearing of the valleys and the stunted growth of the summits), one cannot consider the amount of good timber in the peninsula of Sierra Leone as being very important. Probably there are from 7,000 to 10,000 acres of timber in the peninsula. This is, however, almost invariably inaccessible. The streams are too small to float the logs, and until there are good and cheap means of transport, the forests cannot be made use of on a large scale. Nothing would confer a greater benefit on the peninsula than two good roads and the destruction of most of the forest. The climate is too humid for the rainfall to be dangerously diminished, though, of course, the valleys which contribute the water supply of Sierra Leone should not be denuded. In the black country it is almost an invariable rule that every river and stream possesses a belt of forest from 50 to 100 yards wide on each bank. The trees in these river belts are sometimes of considerable height; generally, however, they are not of very valuable kinds. It would, Mr. Elliot thinks, be possible to utilise a considerable amount of this timber, as, although the Scarcies is not navigable beyond Kambia, there is no particular reason why the logs should not be floated down the river in the rainy season. Really valuable and extensive forest is almost non-existent on the route which the Commission followed.

This pamphlet throws a strong light upon a matter of which, perhaps, most people, even of those specially interested in the regeneration of Africa, have heard but little. The evidence now brought together goes to prove that in certain parts the wages of native labourers are paid, even in the case of mere boys and girls, in spirits, and that as a result, in some places, after the first hour or so, labour is unprocurable on account of the drunkenness of the people. ""The idea of drinking spirits is inseparable from the notion of European life in the ken of the natives. Owing to the relaxing climate of the rivers, there are few factories which cannot tell their tale of hard drinking and certain death as a consequence. But we are repeating an oft-told story, and those who read these pages have probably made themselves acquainted with the state of the West Coast in some degree. ... Competition is relentless; times are very bad; palm oil has fallen to a ruinous rate. But the degradation of the tribes of West Africa has reached a depth which is appalling."" Few men are more fitted to testify concerning the extent to which liquor trafficking with the native races of Africa has reached than Mr. Jas. Irvine, of Liverpool; and the following extract from a communication from him speaks volumes: ""It is very difficult to give you an account of the ramifications of the drink traffic on the West Coast of Africa—not because there is little to be said, but because it is only a repetition of the oft-told story in every part of the world. The extent of the trade is so prodigious that I think the following estimate of the quantity annually poured into the delta of the Niger relieves me from the necessity of further remark concerning this evil. ... I am sure I do not over-estimate the quantity when I put it down at 60,000 hogsheads of 50 gallons each as the annual consumption in the rivers."" We have in the native African one whose natural character is so weak that he easily becomes a victim when a dead set is made at him by those who are able to influence him. One needs go no further than the store-house of the first West African factory to know what is the native\'s weak point, and the form of the attack made upon it. His propensity to strong drink has been pandered to until things could hardly be worse with him. Mr. Joseph Thomson, the eminent African traveller, recently laid before the members of the Manchester Geographical Society his views upon this subject, and which fully support what has been already said: ""In the notorious gin trade lies a greater evil even than slavery. It is indeed a scandal and a shame. ... We talk of civilizing the negro and introducing the blessings of European trade, while at the same time we pour into this unhappy country incredible quantities of gin, rum, gunpowder, and guns. ... The trade in spirits is simply enormous. The appetite for it increases out of all proportion to the desire for better things; and, to our shame be it said, we are ever ready to supply the victims to the utmost, driving them deeper and deeper into the slough of depravity, while at home we talk sanctimoniously as if the introduction of our trade and the elevation of the negro went hand in hand.""

The Commissioner\'s object in doing so was to protect the remnants of the magnificent cedar forests on Mlanje, and that this policy was a wise one is shown by the report which has just been addressed to the Commissioner by Mr. John M\'Clounie, who is in charge of the Government forests in that district. In this report Mr. M\'Clounie says: ""I have now been all over the Ruo plateau and the Luchenya, and the Likubula gorge, and the Tuchila plateaux. The district round the source of the Tuchila is by far the best and most timbered part of the mountain. A few straggling trees are seen near the source of the Ruo and only one of any size, while the Luchenya is dotted with cedar along its slopes. The Likubula is well wooded, but the forests are almost inaccessible. On the plateau round the source of the Tuchila the ground is covered with compact cedar forests, and may be estimated at 700 to 800 acres, on that around the Likubula about 200 acres, and a further 100 acres round the Luchenya. Giving the number of trees to the acre as 150, the total number of full-grown existing trees should stand at 150,000, with an average of 40 cubic feet of timber each. At the present value of 3s. per cubic foot the total value of these trees would be £900,000. But if this timber was sold, as it ought to be, at 6s. a cubic foot, the wealth would be doubled. As I have gone all over the woods and noticed quantity and quality, these figures may be taken as near the mark. It is no exaggeration to say that five or six years\' more delay in the assumption of control over the remaining patches of cedar forest would have meant the entire extinction of this unique conifer, which there is abundant evidence to show was once indigenous to all the high mountains and plateaux in the southern part of British Central Africa. Up to the present I have cut up nothing but dead wood, which, in most cases, is in good, seasonable condition. The supply of timber yearly might be considerable, and not materially affect the forests for many years, especially as there are large numbers of young trees growing up in all the woods which must now be protected from fire.

Yet we find that the ivory trade with the Congo Free State continues to steadily increase. This ivory comes from the Higher Congo, both north and south of the river. Steamers bring it as far as Stanley Pool, and from there to Matadi, 250 miles, Native carriers—mostly if not invariably slaves—bring it on their backs. An eye-witness lately reported that he had seen in one day 500 carriers go into Matadi, each carrying a tusk 65lb. in weight. When tusks weigh 200lb, which not infrequently happens, four men carry them. Most of the ivory now coming down is known as ""dead ivory."" Some of the elephants from which these tusks came were killed a century ago, and the Kings of villages have been storing it, placing the last tusks brought in on the top of the pile, and when they required some goods from the coast traders the tusks from the bottom layers were taken. This system has prevailed for many years, and it is estimated that there is yet enough ivory stored up in this manner in the interior of Africa to supply the world\'s demands for the next century. A State expedition visited a Native King some time ago in the interior. Upon leaving, the commanding officer presented the King with a uniform coat, cocked hat, and a sword. The King in return presented the officer with 150 tusks of ivory, averaging 220lb. each, and provided carriers to take them down to the river. These people do not recognise the value, and laugh at the trader for buying. Some of the Native Kings are said to have stockades of ivory built around their dwellings. It is estimated that there are still at least 200,000 elephants in Central Africa. The only ""live,"" or new, ivory which now comes down is that procured by hunters attached to the different trading-houses. Live ivory commands a better price than the dead.\n\nMany travellers and explorers in the Dark Continent have not scrupled to say that as long as the trade in ivory continues to be one of the staple industries of Central Africa, so long it will be impossible to put down the slave trade.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

The General History of Africa emphasizes the economic motivations and adaptive capacities of societies like Dahomey, where the slave trade continued until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888, despite British anti-slave trade measures. This mirrors the situation in Cuba, where the importation of new slaves increased during certain periods, driven by economic interests and the ineffectiveness of treaties and naval patrols. Similarly, The African Times articles detail the ongoing slave trade activities in Cuba, pointing to the influence and power of individuals like Don José Augustin Arguelles and Zulueta, who operated with impunity despite official decrees. The articles also highlight the broader challenges faced by British and European governments in suppressing the trade, noting the inadequacy of measures and the persistence of the trade in regions like Dahomey. While the General History of Africa focuses more on African regions and The African Times on Cuba, both sources illustrate the economic and enforcement challenges in eradicating the slave trade, supporting the claim of its persistence in both Cuba and African regions like Dahomey. However, neither source provides specific details about the effectiveness of measures in Dahomey, with the General History of Africa focusing more on African contexts and The African Times on the broader challenges in Cuba.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that align with the claim regarding the persistence of the slave trade in Cuba and the challenges in eradicating it, which can be compared to the situation in African regions like Dahomey. The text highlights that despite international efforts, such as the British anti-slave trade measures, the slave trade continued in Dahomey until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888. This persistence is attributed to the economic benefits and adaptive capacity of indigenous societies, similar to the economic motivations that sustained the slave trade in Cuba, where imports of new slaves increased significantly during certain periods despite abolitionist efforts. The text also notes the ineffectiveness of treaties and naval patrols in completely halting the trade, as seen in both Cuba and Dahomey. Furthermore, the text discusses the broader challenges faced by abolitionists, including the economic interests of planters and traders, which parallels the difficulties in enforcing decrees against the slave trade in both regions.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

Above all, the planters' opposition was reinforced by the contradiction between the growing demand in the West for the products of slave labour and the prohibition on the import of the labour regarded as essential for increasing the supply of these products.

The answer is obvious if one bears in mind the nature of the expanding plantation economy in Zanzibar and Pemba. Its dependence on slave labour meant that restriction on the procurement of slaves would limit its growth. It is known that plantation agriculture continued to expand after the decree of 1873.$^{49}$ As slave-trading was still legal on the mainland coast, traders were able to transport slaves a long distance along the coast between Kilwa and Mombasa or even Malindi and smuggle them to Zanzibar, and especially Pemba, in small vessels at night in order to avoid the British naval patrol. Even after the slave trade was prohibited on the mainland in 1876, neither the sultan nor the British were in a position to enforce the decree effectively. The clove plantations on the islands had increased demand for food production on the mainland coast, especially grain. Thus, a number of plantations producing grain with slave labour had sprung up all along the coast between Pangani and Malindi. It was therefore impossible during this time to distinguish slaves intended for sale from those intended for use on these plantations.$^{50}$ To make things worse, this was the time when internal strife in many parts of the hinterland was producing large numbers of captives. The traders could easily invent new ways of evading the sultan's soldiers and the British naval patrol. A number of new concealed stations sprang up all along the coast between Pangani and Mombasa, from which small dhows could slip off at night and reach Pemba unnoticed. It is therefore clear that the slave trade remained a major activity well into the colonial period.\nThe European trade missions and the naval patrol against slave traders were limited to Zanzibar and the coastal areas. Although Europeans could no doubt obtain from Arab traders a few stories about places far away from the coast, the vast hinterland remained unknown to them. Gradually, however, events were to turn the attention of the humanitarians and the evangelicals to East Africa. Until 1856 their main interest was still focused on the trans-Atlantic trade.

Their learned observation endorses the popular view. But the proposition needs explanation. Humanitarianism is a Western ideology, and it is unlikely to have found any place in the minds of African distributors of the time - with very rare exceptions. But this does not mean that they were constitutionally incapable of giving up the trade, as Western supporters of slavery maintained. The continuance of the supply of exportable manpower from Africa can be logically explained in economic terms. That the distributors were black and the exporters white is irrelevant: it was a paying proposition, profitable to both trading partners, whose sole object was to make money. That was the situation at the grass roots. The continuance of the supply is to be explained in terms of the efficient working of an integrated system: and what Africans were resisting was the disruption of this system. For one thing, it would have ruined the established business of the distributors,$^{31}$ who had no other prospects, to say nothing of the chain of repercussions it would have set off on the social and political structure, both locally and further afield. In other words, so long as the barter system between the hinterland and the coast, and the coast's foreign trade, had no clear alternative to the slave trade, opposition by African slave-traders to its suppression was dictated strictly by the imperative needs to avoid commercial chaos.$^{32}$ The supposed complicity of the African distributors was no more than a reflex reaction to the immediate economic situation. This also explains the fall in the selling price of exportable manpower: it was the market's defence against growing pressure from the forces of suppression. The latter thus helped to contribute to an unsatisfactory situation. This argument needs to be modi› fied when the exportation of Africans to the north or east is considered. While the economic interests of the slave hunters and distributors are selfevident in this case too, it is hard to see what kind of economic compensa› tion accrued to the countries that were plundered.

His report serves, however, to underline the serious problem raised by the revival of slave-trading on the East coast of Africa. During the period 1860-70, between 30000 and 35000 slaves arrived in the ports controlled by Zanzibar: some were kept on the spot to work in the clove plantations. The remainder were sent as far as Somaliland and Oman; around 1870 Oman was importing 13000 slaves a year, some of whom travelled on to the Persian Gulf and Persia, Mesopotamia or Baluchistan and India.$^{48}$ In 1873, a treaty between Britain and the Sultan of Zanzibar introduced the right of search, including the authorization to seize Arab dhows, but it did not have much impact, just as the AngloPortuguese treaty of 1842 had had little effect on the Mozambique slave trade to the Comoro Islands and Madagascar.

A great deal of research is still needed in order to obtain a clearer view of the whole phenomenon, and emphasis should be laid on the study of oral tradition as being the main source of information.\nAfrican participation in the trade had never been general. Some of the hinterland peoples were quite unaware of it. Some coastal societies destroyed slave ships and held their crews to ransom. Others had their political and class structure overturned by it. Others again drew strength from the authoritarian and exclusivist nature of the system, and in those cases black and white interests coincided in a flourishing business. Some African producers and distributors of exportable manpower did well out of this branch of the coastal economy and foreign trade. During the eighteenth century they bartered nearly 7 million human beings for approximately 300 million piastres-worth of merchandise specific to the 'Guinea trade', including perhaps 80 million firearms. In the same period, the trans-Saharan trade accounted for the deportation of over 700000 individuals and the Indian Ocean trade for about 200 000.

First, the manner in which slaves were procured tended to destroy social and political structures. Social outcasts, offenders against the law, were sold into slavery. A few persons were sold in times of famine or for debt. But the majority of slaves were apparently taken by kidnapping, raiding and wars. The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda. Accordingly, the extensive influence exercised by the Aro over Igboland through its oracle did not become an integrative force.$^{9}$ The element of violence inherent in Aro addiction to the slave trade thus distinguished their influence from the earlier ritual influ› ence of the Nri people over wide areas of Igboland.\nIn the economic sphere also, the disruption to normal agricultural activities must have been considerable. In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars. The metal bars were turned into pewters, ritual bells, state swords, leg-rings, and other ornaments. But these supplies replaced local industries, and the Awka smiths turned their backs on local sources of metal.

Indeed, in the later eighteenth century Edward Long was complaining that a substantial proportion of the currency in Jamaica was in the hands of this sector of the population, and that they monopolized the transportation systems overland as well as along the coast. 52 This situation did not change very much after slavery was abolished, although the number of peasant farmers of African descent increased sharply in the Caribbean. Occupation and biological heritage could and did increase class and caste mobility both during and after slavery. An individual or a family could work their way outward and often upward from slavery to freedom, or from free black to mulatto (especially in Brazil and Spanish America), or from mulatto to white (an exceptional achievement requiring a considerable amount of money) when the indices of race were more strongly cultural than biological. By the later eighteenth century some Spanish American planters and merchants, doubtful of their status, bought certificates from the Crown, called limpieza de sangre, which certified that they had no Moorish or Jewish ancestors in at least the preceding four generations.

The highest appointments in the island were given to men sent out from Spain, not so much to administer important functions as to enrich themselves. He knew an instance in one important city of a collector of revenue who had been three times dismissed for peculation, and as often reinstated by the influence of his family at home. It was a well-known fact that governors who went out to Cuba mere soldiers returned to Spain rich men covered with decorations. The strong desire of the Cubans for amelioration in the management of their affairs had widened and deepened, until at last they arrived at the conviction that they could only achieve liberty by the means to which they had lately had recourse.

If, however—as the honourable gentleman asserts—Spain has fairly and honestly fulfilled her Slave-trade Treaty obligations, it is impossible to conceive what justification the British Government has, of any kind, for interfering, by representation or otherwise, in this matter. There is in this statement an incomprehensible inconsistency, the most striking and forcible comment upon which is to be found in the speaker\'s own account of the manner in which Spain has so fairly and honestly kept her pledged promises. He states that from 1835 to 1868 the number of slaves annually landed in Cuba was 40,000—a total of 1,320,000. A similar statement was made by Earl Russell a few years ago. The official returns do not give so large a number, but they are admittedly inaccurate, and the local authorities deny the introduction of anything approaching to that figure—a denial obviously in the interests of those authorities to make, but none the less unfounded in relation to the fact. It is not here the place to enter into the vexed question of the amount of the slave-population of Cuba, but in a memorial to Marshal Espartero, presented to him by the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society in 1854, some very curious illustrations of Spanish census records will be found quoted, which demonstrate the utter unfaithfulness of documentary evidence issued by the Spanish Government in all matters relating to the slavery question in Cuba. It is no part of our business to attempt to reconcile the flagrant discrepancies those records bear upon their own face. It is sufficient for our present purpose to state that the late Earl of Aberdeen denounced them as false, and affirmed that the slave-population of the island was notoriously far in excess of the number announced by the Government of Spain. The very last returns made by the local authorities were one-half below those of the ecclesiastical authorities, who, for purposes of their own, keep, and have the means of procuring, more authentic records. In 1868, when the abolition of slavery was being pressed upon the Provisional Government at Madrid, the number of slaves in Cuba was affirmed not to exceed 400,000; which, if true, and if true also the reputed importations from 1835 up to 1868—according to Earl Russell and Viscount Enfield\'s affirmations of the fact—would exhibit an average mortality of 30 per cent. per annum. We believe the actual slave-population of Cuba to be nearer 800,000 than 400,000, leaving out the emancipados, and all of these have a right to their immediate and unconditional liberty. The position the British Government might be urged to assume is to assert our treaty-rights, and upon the strength of them to demand the freedom of the Cuban slaves. Had Mr. Hughes\'s motion been framed with this one object, the country would have been made to comprehend exactly the circumstances of the case, and its judgment asked, not in favour of Spain, but of those unfortunate hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children, held in bondage in Cuba—an iniquity for which the British Government, for the last thirty-five years through, is in a great measure responsible. We are prepared to admit that a motion so framed and pressed to a division would have left the mover in a minority, but the weight of facts, the force of argument, and, greater than either, the right and the justice would have been on his side. We know that when a power violates its treaty engagements, the other party to the contract has a right to constitute such a violation a casus belli, and it is remarkable that the late Lord Palmerston, the Earl of Clarendon, and other occupants of the Foreign Office in Downing-street, averted pressure, when it was demanded against Spain, by submitting to the applicants the uncomfortable query: ""Would you have us go to war with Spain?""—a question involving the acknowledgment of the delinquency of that Power, and the helplessness—ought we not rather to say, the unwillingness—of the Governments of the day to deal with that Power as a delinquent. Whilst we do not advocate war, we may allow ourselves to record the fact, that it has been waged for objects infinitely less righteous, and we ought not to omit to refer to the Don Pacifico claims, when the doubtful rights of a private individual nearly involved us in a war with Greece, because Lord Palmerston thought proper to indulge in a special bit of vapouring against a weak State. We assert that diplomacy possesses resources—short of war—which can be rendered effective against a delinquent Power. In the case of Spain, mere representations were laughed at, for, in spite of her shameful conduct, she never asked a favour, but it was granted. She was placed, in every respect, on the footing of the most honourable and most favoured nation. Her slave-grown products—which ought to have been excluded from our markets—were admitted to compete with those of our emancipated colonies, contrary to the protestations and representations of the anti-slavery party, and in defiance of all reason and justice. Whilst the slave-trade was rife, the clause in the Washington Treaty of 1842, empowering Great Britain, the United States, and France to proceed actively against Spain, because her wilful contempt of her slave-trade treaties compelled these Powers to maintain a costly cruising system, with its expensive paraphernalia of Mixed Commission Courts, was never brought into operation—was, in fact, a deader letter than any of that class of defunct literature. Were it now asked that it be applied, the answer would probably be, ""Since 1868, we have no authentic record of any slaves having been landed in Cuba; and Spain has fairly and honestly fulfilled her treaty obligations, therefore we have no case against her."" Why, even according to Viscount Enfield\'s admissions, it is only since 1868 that the slave-trade into Cuba has ceased, and this is not by any means so certain. It was in the early part of December in that year, that the Cuban insurrection broke out. If cargoes of Bozali have been landed in the parts occupied by the insurrectionists, the fact would not reach any ""authentic source of information."" The other parts are in the power of the Spanish party, almost to a man in favour of the old order of things; and if cargoes of fresh slaves have been discharged, on the sea-board their forces, combined with those of the mother-country, command the chances are a thousand to one in favour of the fact not being revealed. We hold it, from a private source, that the slave-trade continues, not to so great an extent even as in 1866, but sufficiently to establish a continuous violation of treaties.'}]","[{'document_title': 'SLAVE-TRADE ON THE EAST COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When individuals set about a thing, they generally manage to do it.

There was a difference between the number of slaves seized and the number surrendered to the supreme authorities of the island. Zulueta and his worthy companions denounced Arguelles to the captain-general as having sold that number of slaves which constituted the difference alluded to. Arguelles maintains that the negroes thus deficient in the surrender were given by him to the parties to whom he is represented as having sold them—given by him for the aid and assistance rendered by those persons in effecting the capture, and as a price indeed agreed to be paid to them for that assistance. And considering the slave-trade morality of the island, this cannot be considered impossible. But as Zulueta and his brother slave-trade capitalists denounced Arguelles, so the persons who had thus received the slaves from Arguelles swore that they did not receive them as a gift, but that they paid from 700* to 750 dollars each for them, while Arguelles maintains that the only crime of which he has been guilty was in so far exceeding his instructions and the intentions of the chief authority, as to have captured such powerful people, such mighty slavetraders, as Zulueta and his friends. And we must say that the impunity which these people enjoy, although they were thus taken in the very act of having superintended the landing of the cargo, &c., of which they were proprietors, leads very strongly to the supposition, by those who know something of the purity of Spanish administration and of Spanish local law courts in such matters, that Arguelles may after all not be the guilty person he has been stated to be, and has been condemned as being. He is now a convict in the slave gang, while Zulueta and his friends are at liberty to arrange for retrieving the loss Arguelles inflicted on them in capturing an otherwise safely-landed cargo of 1,200 slaves, worth to them one million of dollars, or 200,000l.—to arrange for retrieving this by importing other cargoes in the Ciceron from Dahomey.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1864#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.614, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CUBA AND SLAVERY', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""The planters know that slavery is condemned, that they are continuing a system which is not in accordance with the spirit of the age, and they would willingly consent to its abolition if some means could be found to prevent the total ruin which immediate emancipation must cause them.

In this number of our journal we have also to record the painful news of an active foreign slave-trade at Whydah—of the shipment of nearly 1,000 poor wretches in one steamer, destined for the disgusting shambles of the modern plantations of Cuba, there to be used up in eight or ten years in the production of sugar for the British market. We cannot forget that, on those 1,000 slaves alone, the King obtains a fancied profit of some 10,000l., which we enable the Cuban planters to send him, through the slave-traders, for the supply of the raw material out of which they manufacture sugar for us. We are compelled to bear in mind that at the rate of duty he levies on palm oil shipped at Whydah—viz., one dollar per puncheon—there must be a very large exportation of produce to compensate him for relinquishing the slave-trade. We have also recently obtained a new insight into the dreadful ""Customs"" of Dahomey—of the supposed obligation on the part of the monarch to continue them during his life; and Aboekuta, though a hard nut, perhaps, to crack, has in its numerous population a delicious kernel for the wholesale butcher and slave-dealer. Nevertheless, we hail with joy this manifestation on the part of the King of a desire to enter into some amicable relations with the Christian civilization of this country. And we do indeed earnestly hope that advantage will be taken of it by Her Majesty\'s Government. We stated in our last that Commodore A. Eardley Wilmott had been furnished by them with the presents that would be requisite should he attempt a visit to Abomey. And we know his earnest desire to detach the King of Dahomey from the slave-trade. We have, therefore, reason to believe that when he receives, by the mail which leaves Liverpool to-morrow, this interesting intelligence, which has been communicated through us, he will lose no time but proceed to Whydah as soon as his other duties will permit. The King asks for the light to be brought to him; and such a desire ought to be immediately gratified. It may be only curiosity on his part, or a desire for the presents which he well knows he will receive; or to raise himself still higher in the opinion of his people, through that acknowledgment of him as king by this great nation; or it may be only a ruse on his part, to lull the Aboekutans into a fancied security, so that they may become an easier prey. Still, his desire ought to be complied with; the wishes, and, if necessary, the demands, of this Christian country ought to be diplomatically placed before him. The person whom he has named as interpreter should accompany the British negotiator. And then, should all fail—should no good result be obtained—we shall have at least the satisfaction that we performed our duty. We are not sanguine of any immediate good result, because we have no reason to believe that the negotiator has any power to promise a subsidy on the part of this country, which might compensate (until legitimate commerce should be largely developed) for the fancied pecuniary loss the King would sustain by the abandonment of the slave-trade. But we might expect to learn the amount of subsidy that would induce such abandonment; and it would then be for this country to determine whether it would be our duty or our interest to pay the price.', 'last_edit_date': '1862-12-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1862#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.616, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Earl of Derby on Slavery in Cuba', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""A deputation from the Anti-Slavery Society waited upon the Earl of Derby, at the Foreign Office, Downing-street, in reference to the claims of England upon Spain, on the subject of the Slave-trade and Slavery in Cuba.

He would suggest to the noble lord the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs (Lord Enfield) to devise some measure, in conjunction with the American Government, for stopping this emigration.

In 1818 Spain received 400,000l. from Great Britain, as her price for the extinction of the slave-trade with Africa in her dominions, and other matters connected with the suppression of that trade. We hold her to her bargain. We will not have any return of this money. She must perform the obligation she undertook to perform. Her non-performance of it costs us nearly 500,000l. a year. The whole of our slave-trade suppression expenses are caused by her. All other countries have now effectually abandoned and prohibited the importation of Africans into any portion of their dominions. All our expensive machinery for putting down the slave-trade is therefore forced upon us by Spain. Every year brings with it a new pecuniary sacrifice of 500,000l. by us on her account.\n\nNow rich though we are, no doubt, we are not rich enough for this. It is nearly a halfpenny income-tax. Why should we pay an income-tax to Spain? If she forces us to expend that money, which she does, because we cannot set aside our Christian principles, as she sets aside her pecuniary and honourable obligations, let us exact it from her. It can be done; and as it can be done, it ought to be done. The universal voice of the country ought to demand of the Government that it be done. They must put on the screw, or that halfpenny income-tax for Spain will stick by us for ever. And the mode of applying the screw is simple enough. We must take the money out of the profits that the Cuban planters are making by this infamous employment of the African slave-trade.\n\nWhy do they use the African slave-trade and import slaves? To force, on their rich soil, the growth of sugar for the English market. This is past all doubt; it is established by undeniable facts. About 1845 the prosperity of Cuba was at a low ebb. Spain advances slowly as a consumer of sugar. She advanced so slowly, that the Cuban planter, not having access to the English market, had no inducement to increase his production of sugar. Plantations were going out of cultivation. Not more than 2,000 slaves were imported from Africa in a year. It was hoped in England that Spain was really preventing the importation. But it was no such thing. The importation was no longer very profitable; it was, therefore, being gradually discontinued.

The only question in this chapter which gave rise to controversy related to a proposal to exact security from the chiefs and organisers of caravans as a guarantee of their taking no part in the slave-trade. This was obviously not feasible, as caravans seldom return to their starting-point with the same elements. They are renewed from place to place among the tribes they pass, remain often a very long time in the centre, and return to the coast at different points. Ultimately the obligation of giving security was confined to the case of those who had already been condemned for slave-trade offences.\n\nThe abolition of slavery in the American continent put an end to the slave-trade on the West Coast of Africa. In the East it is the existence of slavery which keeps alive slave-trade in the regions where it still prevails; and until slavery in the East is extinguished, slave-hunting will continue to drag on some kind of existence, however successful their efforts in Africa itself may be. **Chapter IV.** therefore deals with measures for the extinction of the Eastern market for slaves.\n\nThis is a task differing considerably from that of abolishing slavery in the West.

This island of Pemba lies 30 miles north of Zanzibar. The coast of Africa is separated from it by a channel of 50 miles\' width. A dead flat, the island is turned to account by a few Arab tenants who hold their lands of the Sultan of Zanzibar and cultivate cloves with more or less success. As a rule, they are in the hands of Parsee money-lenders, and are mulcted by duties of 50 per cent. to 60 per cent. on the exports of their cloves. But the trade continues, because it is possible to import numbers of slaves who are worked to death at a rate unknown on the mainland.\n\nThe duty of acting as ""preventive men"" devolves upon the officers and crews of the British men-of-war stationed upon the East Coast. The coast opposite Pemba is all that the slave trader can desire. Serrated with creeks in which dhows can load up for the run across, it is impossible to frustrate the embarkation of slaves; a high tide and a fair wind together with a dark night, make it 100 to 1 in favour of the venture. The island is reached before dawn, the slaves are hurried inland, and are at once concealed. The deaths of Captain Brownrigg and Lieut. Cooper ought to open the eyes of all concerned to the anomalies of the Pemba slave trade; the first to come to his senses should be the British taxpayer. A large part of the time employed in suppressing slavery on the East Coast is expended in watching this small island. The outlay over the last twenty years may be put at a million sterling in hard cash, to say nothing of men lost in fighting and by fever.\n\nAt the present moment all is transit in on Zanzibar waters. English, German, and French forces are assembled there, and have done honour to our dead officers and men. To the first Power concerned, it is an old tale of frittering away money, varied now and again by the loss of valuable lives.\n\nMeanwhile the Sultan sends off soldiers to Pemba as he sent envoys to Lake Nyassa; the result will be the same.

Efforts to effect stoppage of the trade led to new activities by British traders, consuls, and naval officers, resulting in new relationships with the delta states.

For example, in 1827 a naval squadron was stationed at Fernando Po, and in 1849,$^{ tne}$ & $^{TSt}$ British consul, John Beecroft, was appointed for the entire territories of the Bights of Benin and Bonny. The Court of Mixed Commissions was also set up at Freetown, Sierra Leone, to try the captains of captured slave ships, and to set free the slaves of condemned slavers. For the delta states, these developments meant the demonstration of British power in their waters, bringing the era of gunboat diplomacy in which the British consuls used naval power to negotiate favourable conditions for British traders, missionaries, and explorers. In practice, the consuls, especially after 1850, continued and stepped up a policy started in the 1830s by Edward Nicolls, Governor of Fernando Po, of signing treaties with the local chiefs.$^{6}$ These treaties stipulated the stoppage of the slave trade by the rulers; the adoption of 'legitimate trade', that is, trade in goods other than slaves; laid down regulations for the conduct of legitimate trade; specified the sums of customs duties or comey to be paid by the traders, as well as subsidies that the British government was to pay the local rulers for their agreement to give up the slave trade.\nThese British activities on the coast gradually eroded the power of the local rulers, especially when the consuls and naval officers assisted the British traders to set up their own judicial systems over and above the law of the local states, the so-called Courts of Equity, composed mainly of British traders with the participation of a few local House Heads or chiefs.

The slaving zones from Senegal to Sierra Leone, from the Gold Coast (now Ghana) to Nigeria and from the Congo river to Angola were the stretches of coast› line first encroached upon by the European colonizers. In these localities, features of the colonial economy emerged before the formal advent of colonial rule, because of mutual African and European attempts to stimulate export commodities which served as 'legitimate' replacements to slaves. Rulers, professional traders and other sectors of the population in western Africa perceived advantages in maintaining the foreign trade nexus and access to imported goods. Of course, African propensity to trade with Europeans was not always restricted to the coast. Europeans knew that their trade with West Africa had its roots inland.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

This chapter seeks to examine the nature and major characteristic of these economies.\nThe British, like other colonizers, did not develop a universal theory of colonialism which could embrace all aspects of life in all colonies. Nor did they develop anything near a universal practice of colonialism. Indeed this was impossible as colonialism was imposed on peoples with extremely diverse cultures and backgrounds, and living in widely differing environ› ments. Much was left to the administrators to deal with situations depend› ing on the local conditions. Even in the absence of a clear theory, however, a critical examination of colonial relations brings to light some fundamental assumptions which seem to have acted as guidelines for both the framers and implementers of colonial economic policies. First, the colonies were expected to provide raw materials (agricultural products and minerals) to feed the machines of the industrial imperial power. Second, the colonies had to import manufactured goods from the imperial power. These two assumptions divided the empire into two distinct economic camps - the colonies and the metropolis. Significantly there was very little reciprocity in the relationship. While in most cases the colonies had an obligation to export to Britain before they could consider any other buyer, even if such a buyer would pay higher prices, Britain had no obligation to import exclusively from any of her colonies. She operated through rational econo› mic choices and bought from whoever sold at low prices. The colonized people were also at a disadvantage in the import trade. In some cases they had to buy expensive British manufactures as the colonial state apparatus, under pressure from Britain, raised customs duties for non-British goods. Third, the colonies had to be self-supporting. The colonized peoples had to raise revenue for the general administration and for whatever limited development projects that were undertaken.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.715, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Capital and coercion, c. 1900-f. 1920', 'content': ""Undisguised forms of forced labour and barely disguised forms of slavery were prominent aspects of the entrenchment of the colonial economy in Africa.

Where the plantations were non-British but direct supply zones for British manu› facturing interests, Great Britain tended to 'condone' slavery. One instance was the American South. A second was Cuba and Brazil, which continued through most of the nineteenth century to obtain slaves from the still permitted trade 'south of the line', where the economies of the slave trade remained different, as we indicated above. 44 The nineteenth century up to Partition was, it has been argued, the era of 'informal empire' or the 'imperialism of free trade'. J. Gallagher and R.› Robinson summed up this analysis: 'By informal means if possible, or by formal annexations when necessary, British paramountcy was steadily upheld.'$^{45}$ Free trade is a term too easily thrown around. We should be clear that traders tend to favour free trade if they have a competitive advantage in the market and tend to see ways of restraining free trade if and when they do not. Hence the fact that the role of the chartered companies in eighteenth-century West Africa was less than in the seven› teenth century has led some historians to speak of the rise of free trade. The very process of dismantling of the monopoly powers of chartered companies was however 'a gradual one', we are told; the shift to free trade 'was therefore somewhat limited'; and the explanation of the shift resided primarily in 'practical business reasons', to wit, the lower overhead costs and greater flexibility of response to an expanding slave-trade market.$^{46}$ As for the nineteenth-century era of even freer trade, it has been argued that it rather represented a serious restriction of free trade under the ideology of 'legitimate commerce'. 47 Britain's championship of the doctrine of free trade in"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.718, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic tensions > Production and trade', 'content': ""The abolition of the slave trade by Britain in 1807 introduced an element of structural imbalance into this situation, especially in the south, where surveillance was instituted earliest and maintained most strictly, although domestic slavery was tolerated.$^{48}$ During the second half of the nineteenth century slavery expanded very substantially, especially in the Niger bend. This was because the cost of weapons increased steadily, so that pro› gressively greater numbers of slaves had to be offered in exchange. It is not surprising, then, to find entire groups, such as the Zamberma, spe› cializing in the extraction of this 'black ore'. The main sources of supply, however, were not only the great djihäd conducted by the Muslim leaders of the north and the conflicts in Mossi territory. The trade was also fed from a host of channels that sluiced off slaves from peoples belonging to hundreds of chieftaincies, from the territories of the Tuareg to the areas bordering the trading posts on the coast. During the final decades of the nineteenth century, war broke out in virtually every decade and in virtually every region, and war meant captives. These victims were for the most part from sedentary agricultural communities, which served as a veritable breeding stock for the trade. Hence the underpopulated areas to be found in regions that were literally drained of their inhabitants. Tribute exacted in the form of captives was extremely heavy in many instances.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...''

We have already suggested that the very process of expanding the quantity of slaves 'recruited' began to transform the economic character of the slave trade in western Africa, increasing the 'opportunity costs' of slave-trading and thereby affecting the rate of world accumulation.\nThis general phenomenon combined with a more narrow British concern.\nThe comparative productivity of sugar plantations in British West Indian territories declined throughout the eighteenth century.$^{40}$ A major zone of alternative production available was in British India.$^{41}$ This zone, however, was an area of existing dense agricultural production, where true slavery would have been economically too costly (if one wished to enslave the indigenous population) or politically too difficult (if one wished to import others). Hence the slave trade seemed to be less immediately useful for the production of sugar and other plantation crops in British zones while being counter-indicated if one wished to encourage cash-crop production in western Africa. Britain was at this point the hegemonic power in the world-system and was therefore in a politico-military position to carry out abolition. 42 Indian sugar became a major item on the British scene in 1791, following the crisis caused by the revolution in Santo Domingo.

Still it was felt that, barring the tariff, 'despite the higher freight, the East Indies could undersell the West' (C.N. Parkinson, 1937, p. 85). What happened then? Given the fact that 'the bigger financiers clearly had a foot in both camps' (ibid., p. 86), the resulting Parliamentary decisions might be seen as a compromise: the West Indian lobby lost on abolition but won on the East Indian tariff.

As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service.

As A. G. Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.747, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': ""As already mentioned, the social effects of foreign rule were far from uniform throughout the continent. With respect to the spread of education, the triumph of the new economic forces, the expansion of urbanization and therefore the rise of the new elites, West Africa would appear to have witnessed the greatest advances, followed by Egypt and the Maghrib, South Africa, East Africa and Central Africa. If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind. And even among the British territories, there was also a differential impact. The British colonies where substantial transforma- tions were registered included Egypt, Gold Coast, Nigeria, Uganda and Sierra Leone, with Kenya and the Rhodesias (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) coming after. And if we take individual colonies we discover that more changes took place in the southern than in the northern parts of Gold Coast and Nigeria.

First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape. These provided good stepping stones for the forces of western education, western Christianity and western commerce to penetrate the interior.

Thus Indian traders were not only allowed, but, to some extent, were also encouraged to patronize trade in East Africa, and to some extent in Central Africa. The Asian population in East Africa increased as follows: Uganda: 1910 - 2000; 1917 - 13026; Tanganyika: 1913 - 18784; 1931 - 23422; Kenya: 1921 - 22800; 1931 26759. The 'dislike and distrust of the Levantine communities' in West Africa, which Professor Bauer noticed to be 'marked in official circles', 71 was a relatively recent development. Real hostility towards the Levantines, mostly Lebanese, came not from official circles but from the various European agents of commercial firms, and such hostility was in response to effective trade rivalry presented by the Levantines.$^{72}$ And where British firms appear to have been given preference, it was not because of their respectability, but because they could - with the blessing of the British government - act as effective pressure groups and influence colonial policy› makers. 73 Still, Ehrlich's generalization that 'administrative attitudes, throughout British Africa, rarely encouraged indigenous commercial initiative'$^{74}$ is quite valid. But other factors stifled local initiatives. First of all, general official policy, as would be expected in a colonial situation, was geared primarily towards the advancement of imperialist interests. Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction. By the first decade of the twentieth century, following the construction of railways, European firms were squeezing African traders in two related ways. Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

Unless they broke through the Coast, which he might describe as the crust of Africa, they would not be able to penetrate into the interior of the country. He would ask them to compare the West Coast with the East Coast of Africa, where they had no settlements. Let them compare the civilization, the education, the commerce of the West with what they saw in the East. It might be true that the suppression of the slave-trade had not been brought about by the establishment of these settlements; but the reason why the slave-trade flourished on the Coast was that there was not a vessel in our squadron which could go more than nine miles an hour, so that the evil flourished through a deficiency of administrative ability on the part of a department of the State. As for the climate of the Gold Coast, he believed it was not so bad as the climate of either Sierra Leone or the Gambia; and therefore its climate afforded no reason for its abandonment. The settlement at Lagos had not succeeded because the Governor, Mr. Freeman, had not been well selected.

At the same time, he entirely condemned the policy of attempting to enforce a protectorate over tribes on the West Coast, as unwise in itself, and as unlikely to conduce to the suppression of the slave-trade. He thought it would be a valuable thing if the whole question of the protection of these native territories was discussed by a committee of the House.\n\nLord C.

The occupation of such a country by them could only be justified by considerations of the most disinterested character. Yet in this unhealthy climate—to say nothing of their naval establishment there, which cost 1,000,000l. a-year—they maintained no less than four settlements, which were established in the first instance for the purpose of promoting the slave-trade, and kept up of late years for the purpose of suppressing it. They spent 200 years in inflicting moral and physical injury on the people, and the last fifty years they had spent in doing something like reparation to them. What he desired was to ascertain if these settlements were well ordered and well regulated, and if the objects they had in view were not rather obstructed than promoted by their maintenance. It was only last year that the House was filled with alarm and anxiety, and some of its members with grief and sorrow, because the Governor of one of these settlements had nearly run them into a third war with the Ashantees. The troops were only withdrawn in time to save them from utter destruction. They were told by the Governor that these wars occasioned a total suspension of the objects for which the settlement was made, for whenever a war took place the squadron had to be withdrawn, and that this country must be prepared to bear the whole brunt of the war in men and money, for his government was not a colony, but a protectorate. They were told the other night by the Colonial Secretary that Colonel Conran was making a military progress amongst the tribes for the purpose of a friendly intercourse with the interior. They were told that the residents of the Gold Coast considered that Colonel Conran understood their interests better than the civil governor, and that the Dutch Government of Elmina was unfriendly, and in alliance with our constant enemies, the Ashantees. The circumstances of a Government so situated could not too soon be inquired into. The settlement of Sierra Leone was the most important of all, and ought to be the centre of improvement. A very high authority said that the people here were the very pests of the neighbourhood, and were detested wherever they went. Their exports and imports were steadily declining. In the third settlement of Gambia the exports and imports were also declining. The natives were in a constant state of civil war, and it was difficult, said the Governor, to avoid being mixed up with the troubles of our neighbours. With regard to Lagos, Governor Freeman said that the state of affairs there was going from bad to worse. Such was the state of these four colonies on the West Coast of Africa. The history of these settlements was as follows: The Gold Coast was first occupied by the Portuguese, and afterwards by the Dutch. It came into our possession in 1672. It was first placed under the parliamentary power of the African Company, and it remained in their hands till 1821. The Crown then assumed the government, and it had hardly done so before we were plunged into two Ashantee wars. In 1827 the Crown handed over the government of the Gold Coast to a company of merchants, and they were subsidised by a payment of 4,000l. a-year. He ought to have mentioned that the African Company were subsidised by a payment of from 13,000l. to 20,000l. for the distinct purpose of carrying on the slave-trade. The company of merchants remained in possession of the government till 1843, when their administration was found so inadequate, that the Crown was forced to resume the government, and there it remained till the present day. Sierra Leone was ceded to this country in 1787, for the purpose of emigration of free labour. A very large territory was annexed to the settlement, and this was a feature which characterised all their settlements. The settlement of Gambia was founded in 1816, and it continued under a committee of merchants till 1810. The settlement of Lagos was made in 1852, for the suppression of the slave-trade. In addition to these settlements, he might mention that the free Republic of Liberia was established by the United States of America for the purpose of encouraging free emigration from America, and it afforded the most safe barrier against the export of slaves from Africa. (Hear.) The maintenance of the settlements not only implicated us in the quarrel of chiefs along the frontier, but inevitably tended towards extension and increase. To be at all effectual for the purpose of suppressing the slave-trade, the settlements should necessarily be extended along the coast, for how, he asked, could the export of slaves be prevented when a portion only of the coast could be acted upon. Upon the subject of extensions he would quote the opinion of an officer who, twelve years ago, was employed to take possession of the island of Lagos. His view was that settlements had an inevitable tendency to extension; and that a great mistake had been made in the acquirement of territory around...'}, {'id': 572, 'article_title': 'Parliamentary Intelligence', 'full_section_title': 'Parliamentary Intelligence', 'last_edit_date': '02-21-1865', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1865#article-18', 'issue_date': '23_03_1865', 'content': '\n\nLord A. Churchill said the right hon. gentleman had amply shown the necessity for inquiry into the state of affairs on the West Coast of Africa, and he felt, as he was sure the House must feel, great satisfaction that the right hon. gentleman had redeemed so early in the session the pledge he gave last year. (Hear, hear.) The unfortunate Ashantee war, which last year was the cause of so much pain in the House, was of itself sufficient ground for a committee, but there were other reasons why an inquiry should be now undertaken. The state of affairs on the West Coast of Africa was now, and had been for a considerable period, most unsatisfactory. Without any intention to prejudice the present occupiers of the Colonial-office, he must say that Africa had been the bête noir of the department. The unhealthiness of the climate and various other causes of that nature had militated in a great measure against the full development of the resources of the country immediately bordering upon the British settlements. Cape Coast Castle was one of the oldest, if not the oldest British settlement. It was instituted about 150 years ago, when England was a slaveholding power, for the purpose of enabling us to procure slaves to send to our settlements in America. It had been computed that before the slave-trade was done away with, we exported 590,000 slaves from the African coast to America, and we had thus incurred an enormous responsibility, which, as a Christian country, we were bound to make good in some way to that unfortunate people. Therefore the idea of giving up any of the settlements on the Coast would not, he thought, find favour in England, and he did not understand the mover of the committee to make any such suggestion. All he understood the right hon. gentleman to say was, that the present method of Government required inquiry, and that we must either increase our responsibilities by occupying and forming a colony of the protected territory, or we must reduce our responsibilities by limiting the area over which we now professed to exercise protection. The climate, the right hon. gentleman had stated, was notoriously unfit for the Anglo-Saxon race, and that was the reason why more had not been done there. It had been difficult to get men of a superior class to undertake the charge of government on that Coast, but he believed it would be quite possible to locate the Government officers on higher grounds. The same objection was made to Jamaica and our West Indian colonies till it was found out by going to the top of the hills the amount of sickness was very much reduced, and on the West Coast of Africa there were very high hills indeed, where a climate might be found in which the health of Englishmen would not suffer at all. We had been at a charge of 1,000,000l. to support the slave squadron; but he concurred with the right hon. gentleman that where there was a demand there would always eventually be found a supply. He thought it quite possible that England might be induced to make the protected territory into a colony which would be self-supporting, whereas at present we exercised little or no control over the native chiefs, and had done nothing by education beyond the voluntary efforts of missionaries, or by making roads for their cultivation. He did not mean to say that he was prepared to adopt that view at once, but inquiry might be made in that direction. There were others who thought it much better that we should give up the whole of the protected territories, and simply retain the forts as places where there might be stationed small executive governments and a few soldiers; but he did not think if we simply did that we should be exercising the same control over the slave-trade that we did now; whereas, if we made a colony of the protected territory, he believed the development of cotton, the growth of coffee and other things, would be brought into competition with the slave-grown produce of other countries, and would tend to reduce the value of slave labour. (Hear, hear.) So fully alive were the natives of Cape Coast Castle to the inquiry about to be instituted, that they had subscribed large sums for the purpose of sending over here witnesses of their own to place their case clearly before the committee. They would also have evidence from the Basle Missionary Society, whose exertions in behalf of the Africans he was glad to bear testimony to, especially in instruction in useful occupations, by means of which they were leading the natives much more willingly than societies which confined their operations to religious instruction would be able to do. It was unfortunate that in Gambia trade had been falling off. While the number of English vessels had considerably diminished, there had been a corresponding increase among the French. He thought it was a fit subject of inquiry as to whether our system of government had or had not in any way suppressed the energy of our merchants in trading to that country. There was no doubt we had on the Coast of Africa enormous resources, capable of supplying this country with raw material for our manufactures. He believed that last year we imported to England from Cape Coast Castle fifty tons of cotton of a superior kind. Therefore, by giving fair and proper encouragement to the trade, we should no doubt enable them to produce this superior article to enter into competition with slave-grown cotton. He could only further express a hope that the inquiry would lead to great results for the moral improvement of that part of Africa.

Churchill) had improved the occasion by addressing his missionary friends. With regard to the efforts which they had made for the suppression of the slave-trade, he did not know a brighter page in the history of this country, following truly on a darker page, than that which began with the abolition of the slave-trade which was consummated by Lord Derby's Government in 1833, by the total extinction of slavery in the British dominions, and which was now being continued in what this country was doing on the African coast. He did not agree that the slave-trade could be traced back to a period anterior to history. He rather believed it did not commence until the European era; but he did agree with the right hon. gentleman in quoting the words of the King of Dahomey, that had the white man not been to buy the slave, the trade could never have been carried to the extent it had been. Fully agreeing in the propriety, and not wishing to limit the extent of the inquiry, he regretted to hear one part of the right hon. gentleman's speech. He did not think it was necessary to refer in terms of reproach to those now holding the Government offices on the Coast. They had better go into the inquiry in a dispassionate spirit, not having previously condemned those who were to be brought before them. He much regretted the remarks that had been made with reference to Mr. Pine, the Governor of the Gold Coast. When the hon. baronet brought forward this motion last year, he disclaimed any intention of making an attack personally on the Governor. Mr. Pine had expressed his anxiety to be examined and to have the charges fully inquired into, and had obtained leave of absence for that purpose, so that the noble lord could examine him before the committee. On Mr. Pine's part, he wished to take this opportunity of explaining a matter which at this time last year he was not in a position to explain, and which had given Governor Pine much pain. There was an impression last year that the Governor went away in the Rattlesnake for the benefit of his health without making arrangements with Colonel Conran for the security of the troops. He had since been assured that the Governor had made such arrangements with Colonel Conran as were necessary for the welfare of the troops before he left the Coast. (Hear.) He would refer briefly to what he conceived to be the object of these settlements, and on this point he was glad to find that in the main he agreed with the noble lord. Certainly it was not colonisation. To that climate no man living would wish to see the Anglo-Saxon race emigrate, and colonisation was never attempted there. The purpose of the settlements was merely to be ancillary to our other efforts for the extinction of the slave-trade, and to prevent the recurrence of the horrors that had been perpetrated in that part of the world. How far the four settlements answered this purpose it would be for the committee to inquire. Whereas in 1700 the whole of the Coast was subject to the slave-trade, now it was limited by the squadron to a few places; and now one of the steamers of which they had heard was lying at one of those places ready to start, but was prevented by the vigilance of the squadron. Our policy being the object in view, it was a question whether it was desirable to have four separate governors, and whether four different settlements did not encourage four different policies; whether the expense might not be diminished by having one government, and whether four separate military forces had not to be kept up, as each governor would naturally wish to acquire the maximum force, to be prepared for any difficulty which might arise, and whether having four governors was not likely to encourage the occurrence of four difficulties at one time, whereas under one governor he would temporise and dispose of one before he got into another. For these reasons he thought there was a legitimate subject for inquiry, particularly as he found a considerable increase in the number of troops kept on the Coast, and that an increase of force did not satisfy the demand, because that demand was still increasing. He found, also, that the buildings in the colony were not sufficient for the troops, and that it would be necessary to come to the House for a vote, but he was unwilling to do so pending the inquiry which he knew would take place upon that point, and also because he knew that the force at the Gold Coast must be removed before the commencement of the next rainy season. The conclusion, therefore, which the Government came to was not to ask the House for an increased vote of money for buildings, though he would have been prepared to deal with the question but for the intended inquiry. All the surrounding circumstances of the case led him to think that there should be a committee of inquiry, and another strong reason for wishing for the assistance of a parliamentary committee was that this was not a new question, but it was one which rested upon high and great authority—viz., that of a committee on which sat Lord Derby, who was at the time Colonial Secretary; Earl Russell, who had since been Colonial Secretary; and Mr. Speaker, and many other members of influence; and it was upon their express recommendation that a governor was appointed for Sierra Leone. He said, therefore, that it would be most right to have the authority of a fresh committee and further evidence, in order that they might decide the question as to what should be done in the future. The right hon. gentleman having given notice of inquiry, he had prepared for it during the recess, and to that end he had requested General Ord, the Governor of Bermuda, who was at home upon leave, to visit the Coast of Africa, and he had done so, and had since returned; and when the committee met, the instructions which were given him and his report, which had not yet been presented, would be laid before them. General Ord believed that these settlements were important auxiliaries for the purposes for which they were instituted; that many alterations might be made for increasing the efficiency and diminishing the expenses of those establishments; and it was in accordance with his general recommendations that the Secretary at War and himself had taken the step of reducing the force employed upon the Coast. He had thus shown the views which the Government entertained as to its being safe and expedient to diminish the military force. He would enter into the inquiry with the greatest pleasure, and he sincerely trusted that the result of the inquiries would be not only increased efficiency and economy in the settlements which they might think it expedient to maintain upon the Coast of Africa, but he also earnestly trusted that the committee would go into the inquiry in the spirit which the right hon. gentleman had predicated, though not in a spirit to withdraw their noble efforts for the suppression of the slave-trade, but that those efforts should be made still more efficient for the purposes for which they were instituted, for he knew of no efforts more noble in which this country had ever engaged. Nor, looking round at what was passing in other nations, he thought that this was not the time for flinching from the task they had undertaken; but that the sense of universal detestation and determination to abolish this infamous traffic, should induce them to continue those efforts, and thus bring about a result not less glorious than that which was accomplished on the day when this country abolished slavery in our own colonies.""}, {'id': 1635, 'article_title': 'Future of the West Coast Settlements', 'full_section_title': 'Future of the West Coast Settlements', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1869#article-13', 'issue_date': '23_09_1869', 'content': 'Nor one of the British West Coast Settlements can be either abandoned, ceded, or exchanged without the full and free consent of the people interested. This is our brief reply to the queries and suggestions of past and present Under-Secretaries for the Colonies in the House of Commons. It is not our business here to enter upon a consideration of the new policy of Downing-street with regard to British colonies generally, as shadowed forth in Colonial-office despatches and official and other authoritative declarations in Parliament. The policy of setting all the purely British colonies free from the mother country, and thus casting off her emigrated children in order to save the supposed burden of their protection may prevail, and Great Britain may stand out among the nations as an almost branchless trunk, hastening rapidly thereby the inevitable period of her utter prostration; but even then the West African Settlements occupy so exceptional a position in their relations with her, that they could not be included in this general policy without bringing upon her a degree of odium and judgment which no nation can afford to incur and provoke. These settlements were not founded, as Mr. Monsell asserted they were, for the purpose of suppressing the slave-trade. One—at least of them—that of Cape Coast and the Gold Coast—was founded for the express purpose of carrying on the slave-trade, in order to procure a supply of labour to the plantations in America and the sugar colonies of the Antilles; and the others for objects of Imperial policy, at periods when the new suicidal doctrine of the uselessness of colonial possessions had not become an article of political faith among any class of politics men. Up to a very late period the Government and people of Great Britain looked with a most jealous eye upon all extension of dominion by France on the West Coast of Africa, and this not because of French slave-trading proclivities, but because an increase of French establishments there was deemed to be menacing and prejudicial to British interests. The efforts to colonise Sierra Leone from Britain and Nova Scotia, and its subsequent history as the asylum for liberated slaves, are too well known to render any detail or comment necessary here. The Gambia settlement was a consequence of the restoration of Senegal to the French under the provisions of the treaty of Vienna. British merchants had established themselves in the captured French colony; under the severely exclusive French system this was no longer a place for them when it was restored; they consequently removed their establishments to the sandbank at the mouth of the Gambia, and thus Bathurst was founded. For a time they ruled themselves; but the Colonial-office stepped in and organised British colonial government in the rising settlement. The Cape and Gold Coast settlement consisted, as already stated, originally of slave factories, and only at a comparatively recent period was made accessory to the carrying out by Great Britain of her policy of repentance; while Lagos, of which we ought to know something, although ostensibly annexed for putting an end to the slave-trade in those parts, would, we believe, never have been so annexed had it not been pretty well understood, that if not made a British it would soon become a French possession. On these grounds the West Coast settlements occupy an exceptional position among the colonies of Great Britain. Again, we do not believe that any one of the colonies peopled by Englishmen, Scotchmen, and Irishmen could be subdued and subjugated by any force that it would suit the purpose and means of any foreign power to send against it; but this cannot be said of the West Coast settlements. If abandoned to themselves by Great Britain, and left without her protection, they would be immediately exposed to foreign aggression, and be compelled to admit some other sovereignty; and few things could be more disgraceful than this to Great Britain, after her having been the means of raising up an educated native class attached to English rule, if that rule be what it ought to be. Strong, however, as these reasons are against abandonment, and unanswerable as the arguments are against cession or exchange, without the full and free consent of the people interested, we should have very grave and painful doubts of their prevailing against the new doctrines now held in high places with regard to British colonial possessions, if we were not able to show that these West African settlements are at present in a position to pay all the expenses of their government and necessary protection, except so much of the latter as can be given by the British Navy without any outlay beyond what Great Britain must necessarily incur in keeping the police of the seas and protecting the commerce of London, Liverpool, Bristol, Glasgow, &c., with the Coast of Western Africa, unless she intend to descend altogether from the position of a first-rate naval power, in which case, as Grattan most truly said, ""she will be nothing.""'}, {'id': 1964, 'article_title': 'GAMBIA—ITS ADMINISTRATION AND THREATENED CESSION.', 'full_section_title': 'GAMBIA—ITS ADMINISTRATION AND THREATENED CESSION.', 'last_edit_date': '12-12-1870', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1871#article-5', 'issue_date': '23_01_1871', 'content': ""To show what an outrageous job this providing a pension for Mr. Richard Pine is, I am bound to state that after the Colony of the Gambia was relieved of this gentleman, as was fondly imagined, by his translation to another colony and a higher office, the appointment of Queen's Advocate was filled up by bestowing it on a gentleman who was clerk in the Custom-house at the Gambia, who managed after he was appointed, by a judicious system of obtaining leave of absence as often as he could, to get called to the bar in England; and this individual has also managed after a few years' service to get a pension on the plea of ill-health of 133l. 6s. 8d. per annum, which he is now drawing from the unhappy Gambia Revenue, although he is present well enough to go to India, where he is adding to his pension by practising in that country, although his health was so ruined as to unfit him for the discharge of the duties of his sinecure on the West Coast of Africa.

It is true that the export in this locality is almost, although not entirely, kept under by the vigilance of the squadron, but this is only effected by keeping a number of men-of-war (there were six in December last) anchored within two miles of the coast, at short distances from each other, with armed boats in the intervals; an arrangement entailing the severest and most trying duties on the officers and men employed, and attaining its partial success only at very great cost to the country.\n\nIf the present trade of the settlements be compared with that of any other British possessions, it is not certainly of any great moment; but, such as it is, it owes its continuance mainly to the encouragement and protection which their presence affords it. Their exports in 1863 (the latest for which complete returns can be obtained) amounted to within a trifle of 650,000l., whilst their imports for the same period reached 533,000l.\n\nThe mode in which the trade is carried on has been already alluded to in the former part of the report, and it will be readily understood that a commerce, which is conducted chiefly by native agents, and to a great extent in countries inhabited by savage and lawless tribes, at considerable distances from the settlements, can only be prosecuted in safety when their influence is felt and their authority respected; indeed, notwithstanding the comparative security afforded to trade, local interruptions of it are but too numerous, and the difficulties which have arisen between the natives and ourselves have, in many instances, had their origin in robberies and assaults committed by them on our traders and their servants, so that the merchants are probably not in error in asserting that the complete annihilation of their trade would in most cases follow the withdrawal of the protection they now enjoy.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.723, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

Lagos has for many years had a large trade carried on by British and other European merchants, yet this did not prevent it from being at the same time the head-quarters of slavery in the Bights. At Whydah an extensive trade in palm-oil has existed since 1849, and yet slaves have been regularly shipped from that port up to the present day, and, as has been already stated, a cargo was awaiting embarkation there in December last. Nor is this difficult to explain; palm-oil, which forms the principle article of trade, is collected by natives, chiefly domestic slaves, residing at or near the coast, its weight and bulk preventing it from being brought from a great distance in a country where there are no rivers; and it is evident that it would answer the chiefs better to turn their labour to account in this way than to sell them for exportation, even were not the customs of the country entirely opposed to such a proceeding. There is nothing, however, to prevent the chiefs from purchasing for export any number of the slaves captured in the hunts which are regularly undertaken for this purpose in certain parts of the interior, and so legitimate commerce and the slave-trade may be found combined in any spot on the coast to which British authority or influence does not extend.\n\nThus the existence of the British settlements, and of the Republic of Liberia, has served to eradicate the slave-trade from all but one spot on the 1,500 miles of coast extending from the Gambia to Quittah; and the recent acquisition of Lagos may be said to have freed almost entirely from the curse the remainder of the coast; the two exceptions being the small spot between the Gambia and Sierra Leone, the case of which has already been referred to in the report on the latter colony, and a portion of the sea coast lying between Quittah and Lagos, immediately in the rear of which are the dominions of the notorious King of Dahomey.\n\nIt is well known that, from the peculiar circumstances of his country, this monarch is indebted for his wealth and the maintenance of his authority over his people almost exclusively to the slave-trade. Whydah, the chief seaport of his dominions, is, as it has always been, the principal place of export; and advantage is also taken, when the vigilance of the cruisers renders it necessary, of the independent towns of Great Popo, Aghway, and Little Popo, situated to the westward, the inhabitants of which are only too ready to afford every facility for a trade from which they derive such profit.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.747, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Mr. Hutton on West African Affairs', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Manchester, February 25, 1873.\n\nTo the Directors of the Chamber of Commerce, Manchester.\n\nGentlemen,—The present unsatisfactory state of the trade of the West Coast of Africa induces me to request your immediate and earnest consideration to the condition of the British settle- ments there, and to the manner in which the commercial in- terests of this country on that coast are neglected by Her Majesty's Government.\n\nWherever slavery has existed Her Majesty's Government has ever been eager and the first to avenge at any expense the cause of the poor negro; the mere suspicion of slavery has always brought to the spot one of Her Majesty's ships of war; but\n123\n\nBritish merchants on the West Coast of Africa are most heavily, arbitrarily, and exorbitantly taxed by Her Majesty's Government to support the officers they send out, and the traders appeal in vain for that protection to their lives and property and for that consideration to their interests to which they have every moral and just claim.\n\nThe injustice British traders suffer from this want of protection has most materially weakened their influence over the natives, and in many parts the only evidence of British rule in Western Africa is the presence of the tax-collector.\n\nThe British merchants also suffer most grievously from the commercial ignorance and utter incapacity of the officials sent out by the Colonial-office; the improper appointments and the constant and frequent changes made in the Administration are, in fact, the main causes of the present unsatisfactory state of the settlements and of the trade of the West African Coast.

The conduct of the masters and seamen of these trading vessels was often outrageous. The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment. With the missionaries it can be imagined how these ruffians came in conflict; and so angry were they at the prospect of the missionaries protecting their victims, or interfering with them, that they bribed and frightened the native chiefs, and used every effort to prevent the missionaries obtaining any hold on the country. The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

The great future wealth of the interior plateaux will certainly lie in their mineral deposits, the riches of the West Coast region lie in its numerous and valuable vegetable products, of which the most striking are palm oil, and ground nuts, benniseed, shea butter, rubber, gums, spices, cotton, dyes, and valuable timbers, among which ebony occupies a prominent place. With regard to animal products, I might mention ivory and monkey skins. Whereas some of the great races of the interior speak languages which connect them with the Hamitic and Semitic families. The native inhabitants of the West Coast are all that there is of most typically Negro in character; yet I do not mean they are races of particularly low development; on the contrary, the typical Negro is a fine specimen of man, and is by no means as low in his mental state as the races of Polynesia and America. I may cite the Kru tribes of that portion of West Africa which is known as Liberia, a country inhabited by an industrious, energetic, hardworking, stalwart population of free men. An element of heterogeneous ex-slave settlers among the tribes of the coast may be found in some parts of the Colonies of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos. These people represent the Nemesis which invariably follows national crimes. We and our American children indulged to a greater extent than any other European nation in the African slave trade, and, as our wrong-doing was violent and exaggerated, so to a certain extent was the abrupt reparation which followed. Although I would not minimise the work done by our blockade on the West Coast, the abolition of the slave trade was more effectually brought about by the abolition of slavery in the United States of America. One result of our suppression of the slave trade in West Africa has not been altogether advantageous. I refer to the Slave Colonies established at Sierra Leone, and at Fernando Po and other points on the coast. It may be taken that the slaves exported from any district are the least worthy people in it, and the result is that a large proportion of this population is descended from the sweepings of West Africa, and has not yet passed through sufficient generations to eliminate the ancestral badness of its progenitors. So, although here and there a negro has shown what the race can attain to under favourable circumstances, still the bulk of the ""S\'a Leone"" people who are scattered up and down the coast are of an undesirable character, and the cause of indiscriminating blame on the part of superficial observers which is most unjustly laid on the shoulders of the entire population of West Africa; whereas many of these races are superior in intelligence, enterprise, and integrity to any of our negro fellow-subjects in South Africa or the West Indies. What admirable recruits to civilised society can be obtained from many of these people may be instanced by such men as Bishop Crowther, Archdeacons Johnson and Crowther, Samuel Lewis, and other divines and lawyers and officials in West Africa, who are on a par with well-educated white men, and in some cases superior in intelligence and acquirements to the whites with whom they come in contact. It is absurd, however, to regard the Negro race, as a whole, on the same average level as the European—they are far below us. Take them in their native wilds, and they are what we were before Julius Caesar landed in this country; indeed, in many cases they are not 2,000 years behind us, but 10,000. They are in the condition of some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and Gaul, and Spain, whose history we can dimly spell out from their implements and scattered remains, who were undoubtedly cannibals and probably naked, and leading a brutish life. Yet we can in a few years drag them from the condition that prevailed 2,000 years before Christ into the year of grace 1889. We can take a cannibal from the Upper Cross River, and transport him to the centres of civilisation in England or America, where everything represents the utmost result of our present development; but what will be usually the result both with the individual and the race? The savage mind will be unable to grasp and assimilate one-third of the wonders presented to his consideration, and will probably even suffer from the shock. We cannot expect the negroes of West Africa to become all at once intelligent, self-governing people. For many years the white races must be their guardians and educators, and we must educate the negro by force if necessary, leaving him to understand us afterwards, when we have raised him to a condition to do so.

For nearly 300 years English merchants have been trading in Gambia, which is the nearest colony to the mother country. The annual imports during the last ten years have averaged 127,000l., and the exports 155,000l. The annual revenue is raised by import and export duties, and amounts to 18,000l., out of which sum over 6,000l. is paid in salaries to the Governor and about 25 civil officers appointed by the Colonial-office.

There is a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, but only one merchant is a member, whose presence is tantamount to being useless when opposed to the opinions of the Government officials. The Gambia merchants complain that in 1870, after attempting to dispose of this colony, the Imperial Government withdrew all the troops, and ever since they have been denuded of all means of defending themselves; and although the Home Government has been appealed to for help, not even a gunboat has visited the colony during the last 16 months, and the colony itself has been compelled lately to arrange for the purchase of a small armed steamer to run up and down the river. Serious disturbances have recently broken out among the natives on British territory, and the natives having threatened an attack upon Bathurst—the seat of the Government—this colony has been compelled to obtain aid from the French Government, and to get their town garrisoned by French troops, and the harbour protected by a French war vessel.\n\nThe colonists also complain that they have now no direct mail communication with this country, and that they are compelled to contribute 1,000l. per annum towards the useless maintenance of a small steamer running once a month to Sierra Leone, 500 miles further down the Coast.

Sierra Leone, however, has not much to show for its century of British rule. Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary. Here at present the great Mahommedan Chief Samadu is the actual ruler, and has created one of those African empires which are easily reared by successful robbers with extravagant bloodshed and widespread depredation. Samadu has several times fought the French on the Senegambian frontier, but of late he is said to have concluded peace with them.

It exports palm oil, palm kernels, rubber, gum, camwood, besides skins and benniseed and ground nuts.\n\nLiberia is British in language, and to a great extent in such culture as it possesses, although it enjoys an independent Government. But its native inhabitants, the Kru-boys, are under the delusion that they are British subjects ""of a sort,"" and do not admit any political connexion with the Americanised negroes who claim to govern them.

On the east we are similarly threatened by the Germans. They started with the possession of a small station at Beh, the people of which had long been desirous of entering the protectorate, but their offers were refused by the Government. This year a Commissioner was appointed to define the frontier. A line was decided on extending due north from the coast for a distance of over three miles into the interior. On this decision the Germans immediately annexed the Krepe country as far as the banks of the Volta. The Krepes were formerly in the Danish protectorate when we acquired Quittah and all the Danish possessions. Krepe went with the rest, yet we have allowed the Germans to annex the place. The sympathies of the natives are solely with the British. These German annexations are made by the advice and on the surveys of the Basle missionaries, who have for years been subsidised and protected by the British Government. For the rescue of some of their mission the Ashantee war was undertaken. The importance of these annexations will be seen when one has a knowledge of the trade routes to the interior, as it is upon the trade with the interior that the colony depends. There are three routes. The western is up the Tando River. A very large trade is carried on here, Ashanti being mainly supplied by this route. The command of the River Tando is lost if we permit the French to dispossess us of part of Apollonia and Aowin. The central route is via Cape Coast to Prahsu and Coomassie. A small trade is done here, owing to all the carriage being by land. This route is in British hands so far. The eastern, which will be the more important route, as by it most of the Mussulman trade is carried on, passes by the Volta through Krepe. Unless the Germans are dispossessed of this country, no British trade will be done this way.

The repatriation of savings and deposits of Africans by the banks and the discrimination practised against Africans in the granting of loans further impeded African development.\nFrom the above, it can be safely concluded, in spite of the protestations of Gann and Duignan, that the colonial period was a period of ruthless economic exploitation rather than of economic development in Africa, and that the impact of colonialism in Africa in the economic field is easily the bleakest of all."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""The colonial presence also led, as has been pointed out above, to the appearance on the African scene of an increasing number of expatriate banking, shipping and trading firms and companies, and from the 1910s onwards their amalgamation and consolidation into fewer and fewer oligo› polies. Since it was these trading companies that controlled the export as well as the import trade and fixed the prices not only of imported com› modities but also of the exports produced by the Africans, the huge profits that accrued from these activities went to the companies and not to the Africans. Moreover, there was hardly any tax on profits nor were there any regulations compelling the companies to invest part of their profits locally or to pay higher rents for concessions. Neither the local colonial administrations nor the African landowners therefore benefited directly from their activities. The other consequence of this development was of course the elimination of Africans from the most profitable and important sectors of the economy altogether. The African merchant princes of the second half of the nineteenth century therefore virtually disappeared from the scene while their descendants merely had to become the employees of the expatriate firms and companies in order to survive. Here again, as in the industrial field, the emergence of a class of Africans with business experience and managerial skills was prevented.\nColonialism, as Rodney has pointed out, also virtually put a stop to inter-African trade. Before the colonial era, a great deal of trading went on between African states and long-distance and caravan trading activities were a very common feature of the economies of Africa. But with the establishment of colonialism, such inter-African short- and long-distance trade was discouraged if not banned altogether as, in the words of Rodney, 'the arbitrary political boundaries of each colony were generally taken to mean the limit of the economies',$^{29}$ and as the flow of trade from each colony was reoriented towards the metropolitan country. The elimination of much of this age-long inter-African trade and commercial relations thus prevented the strengthening of old links and the development of new ones that could have proved of benefit to Africans.

As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology.

In those parts of Africa where Africans were not allowed to grow cash crops such as Kenya and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), as Colin Leys has shown, 'within the space of a generation they had effectively been converted from independent peasants, producing cash crops for the new markets, into peasants dependent on agricultural wage-labour'. 27 Sixthly, the commercialization of land already referred to led to the illegal sale of communal lands by unscrupulous family-heads and to increasing litigation over land which caused widespread poverty especially among the ruling houses. In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans.

As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts.

Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

But this does not mean that they were constitutionally incapable of giving up the trade, as Western supporters of slavery maintained. The continuance of the supply of exportable manpower from Africa can be logically explained in economic terms. That the distributors were black and the exporters white is irrelevant: it was a paying proposition, profitable to both trading partners, whose sole object was to make money. That was the situation at the grass roots. The continuance of the supply is to be explained in terms of the efficient working of an integrated system: and what Africans were resisting was the disruption of this system. For one thing, it would have ruined the established business of the distributors,$^{31}$ who had no other prospects, to say nothing of the chain of repercussions it would have set off on the social and political structure, both locally and further afield. In other words, so long as the barter system between the hinterland and the coast, and the coast's foreign trade, had no clear alternative to the slave trade, opposition by African slave-traders to its suppression was dictated strictly by the imperative needs to avoid commercial chaos.$^{32}$ The supposed complicity of the African distributors was no more than a reflex reaction to the immediate economic situation. This also explains the fall in the selling price of exportable manpower: it was the market's defence against growing pressure from the forces of suppression. The latter thus helped to contribute to an unsatisfactory situation. This argument needs to be modi› fied when the exportation of Africans to the north or east is considered.

Equally guilty of overstatement are those colonial apologists, such as Gann, Duignan and Lloyd who see colonialism as an unqualified blessing for Africa as well as those like Perham and Fieldhouse who see the record as a balanced one. A more accurate judgement in this writer's opinion is not that colonialism did not do anything positive for Africa, it indeed did. But Europeans did make huge profits in Africa through mining companies, trading houses, banks, shipping lines, plantations and concession companies. Moreover governments held substantial foreign reserves from the colonies in metropolitan countries which must have provided some of the capital for metropolitan development. Finally, metro› politan industries benefited from cheap raw materials obtained from the colonies and profits made from the export of manufactured goods. When all this is compared with what the African owners of the land, peasant agriculturalists and mine labourers obtained, and the fact that whatever infrastructural and social facilities that were provided had to be paid for by the colonies themselves, one cannot but marvel at the raw deal which colonialism thrust on Africans. Moreover, whatever colonialism did for Africans in Africa, given its opportunities, its resources and the power and influence it wielded in Africa at the time, it could and should have done far more than it did. As even Lloyd admits: 'So much more might perhaps have been done had the development of backward territories been seen by the industrial nations as a first priority'.$^{49}$ It is precisely because colonial rulers not only did not see the development of Africans as their first priority, but did not see it as a priority at all that they stand condemned. It is for these two reasons that the colonial era will go down in history as a period of growth without development, one of the ruthless exploitation of the resources of Africa, and on balance of the pauperization and humiliation of the peoples of Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""Even worse still was the impact of colonialism in the cultural field. Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

In some cases, the influences from Africa were strong enough and pervasive enough to forge a genuine Afro-American culture competing with, and sometimes complementing the Europeanderived culture.\nIn the USA the political-structure imposed a rigid dichotomy between black and white in the population, relegating any individual with any degree of African ancestry to the category of black.$^{51}$ By contrast, throughout the rest of the hemisphere a three-tiered social categorization prevailed, corres› ponding to the dominant groups of black, mixed, and white.

We might have added to the above from two to three hundred bags of copper ore, containing, as we have been informed, above 45 per cent. of pure copper. The latent wealth of Africa, on which we have so much insisted, is not a myth. It is a fact, in which lies concealed the germ of future African industrial regeneration, which it is indispensable should go hand in hand with the inculcation of the ennobling precepts of Christianity. The thirty tons of cotton have been produced by the natives for exportation chiefly in consequence of the representations and exertions of two or three educated Africans, who are untiring in their efforts to impress upon the chiefs and people the great and permanent, as well as immediate advantages to be obtained by an extension of the cotton-growing industry among them. It must not be forgotten that this cotton is produced in districts remote from the Coast, and in countries without roads, or any other means of conveyance, save on the heads of men and women. These disadvantages under which the native African labours should be always kept in view, when the ridicule that might otherwise attach in some minds to such seemingly unimportant shipments will, we think, be in a great degree removed. The same remarks as regards transport apply also to the coffee and the copper ore; these, also, have not only to be collected, but to be carried, also, for some scores of miles on human heads to the Coast for barter and shipment. The coffee is not the produce of any modern plantations—of any recent effort to introduce the culture of that valuable berry. The coffee-tree has become abundant over many large districts in Western Africa. In the Rio Nunez, where the berry is said to be quite equal, if not superior, to the Arabian Mocha, and elsewhere, the coffee-tree was originally introduced by the Jesuits, at a period when Portugal was considered almost sole European possessor of Western Africa. Although neglected, the coffee-tree has flourished, and is now found intermingled, and in some places very abundantly, with other trees in the dense and difficult forests which continue, and will, we suppose, continue for yet some time to come, to occupy a soil which might, if a proper stimulus were given by European enterprise, furnish abundant supplies of tropical produce to the civilized world. Unproductiveness is not only now a curse to Africa, but an injury to Europe—an injury the extent of which will never be fully comprehended until that unproductiveness shall cease. And never until then will the European mind become convinced of the magnitude of the error that was committed when the foreign slave-trade ran riot in Africa—when desolation and depopulation were spread over vast and fertile districts, in order that slaves might be procured for producing in the Transatlantic and other European tropical possessions those articles which the African, if left at home, and humanely stimulated, could have produced in tenfold abundance, and at a very much smaller cost. We hope these considerations will weigh with those of our friends—the few, alas! who do really feel a proper interest in the moral and industrial advancement of the African people in Africa. There is, as we have always strenuously insisted, an intimate and necessary union between the moral and industrial efforts in Africa. In our last number we inserted an appeal on behalf of Mrs. Moseley's noble effort for the enlightenment and social elevation of the female population of Cape Coast. That effort strikes at the root of one of the most prolific sources of evil in Africa. No teaching—no instruction—no mere exhibition of the truths of Christianity—can produce any great and permanent results, any more than cotton planting or coffee gathering can produce them, unless the female population be elevated to its proper Christian equality in the social scale; and we hope the noble English ladies who are strenuously labouring for the good of the human race will take this truth to heart. While pressing on our merchants and capitalists the necessity and advantage of stimulating African industry, by increased commercial facilities and judicious pecuniary help, we press also on the hearts of our Christian women the absolute and indispensable necessity of efforts on their part to unroot the diabolical chains which have hitherto bound the African female population in a cruel and filthy social despotism and degradation, which no pen could adequately describe.""}, {'id': 1088, 'article_title': 'CLIMATE OF WESTERN AFRICA.', 'full_section_title': 'CLIMATE OF WESTERN AFRICA.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1867#article-25', 'issue_date': '23_04_1867', 'content': 'I am not singular in believing that healthy Europeans coming to Africa to reside may do so with comparative safety, if they will only take proper precautions to preserve their health.

They are far from being the stupid race we so often hear them called. Keen at a bargain, they are often a match for some of us in that boasted Yankee trait. Apt to learn, quick to understand and to appreciate advantages, they are a people easy to assume and appropriate the best results of civilization—brave in the defence of their rights and homes, yet not aggressive, except when forced by circumstances and their teachings. We forget the whole history of this people in looking only at some particular phase or trait. Their land, the field of the slave-stealer for centuries, has been the scene of cruelty, fraud, and all the worst forms of vice. A people educated by so long a course of schooling in its vicissitudes might well be cruel and vicious. The land has been hunted, from Egypt to the Cape of Good Hope, by foreign and native stealers. Tribes have been driven for self-protection, or by greed of gain, to make captures from other tribes or other parts of their own. To show the debasing power of slavery and slave-hunting, let me say that I have seen slaves brought to the coast from the central parts of Africa who were the most abject specimens of the human race I have ever known—brought by a strong, stalwart tribe, noble in bearing, and brave in war; and these, too, were the same tribe or people only a comparatively short time before. Why this great difference? A simple explanation is only required to show it all. Together and at peace, they had a generous and varied diet of animal and vegetable food, for they had extent of territory in which to hunt and gather; but divided and at war, fighting for self-protection, one party gained the supremacy. Then the other were a defeated people; circumscribed within small limits, unable to hunt, they were soon confined to vegetable diet alone, and then to a single kind, and often to a few simple roots; courage gone, they were reduced to servitude and slavery, and brought to a market.

With equal audacity, a French Cardinal has been preaching a crusade of wrath and vengeance in the name of the Prince of Peace, and calling upon Christendom to unite in sending the fiery cross of blood and slaughter amongst the Arabs in Equatorial Africa. The Pope, too, has lent his countenance and support to this bellicose expedition, although he would, no doubt, tell us that the weapons of his warfare are not carnal but spiritual. Then Britain must needs join in the attack by blockading the coast for the benefit of Germany. It may be asked, What all these armed and warlike proceedings are about? Ostensibly for the suppression of the slave trade, but in reality, for the exploitation of Africa in the interests of European capitalists, speculators, and land grabbers. Religious jealousy inspires many of those modern crusaders, for whose encouragement the holy Father will, no doubt, promise the same reward as his predecessors did to the zealots who attempted to wrest Palestine from the Saracens. An eminent traveller has lately borne testimony to the self-sacrificing life and labours of the Arab missionaries in the Dark Continent. Like the early apostles, they go forth without money, scrip, or change of raiment; entering the villages with the salutation of peace, fraternizing with the natives, and dwelling amongst them as friends and instructors. Under their trading whole tribes have abandoned their hereditary fetish worship, their human sacrifices, their cannibal feasts, their abominable obscene rites, and become converts to the faith of Abraham and Mohammed. Whilst Islam thus exerts such an elevating and beneficial influence, it cannot be denied that the African becomes almost always worse for his intercourse with European traders. For every native who falls a victim to the slave trade, how many are consumed by the more accursed liquor traffic, by the vile, poisonous, maddening concoctions introduced by Germans and Englishmen, who talk in such a sanctimonious manner of the ""sacred principles of humanity and Christianity?"" The Arab slave dealer may kill the body, but is not able to kill the soul; whilst this European spirit-seller sends both body and soul to perdition. Again, the captive African, in trading Arabia, is set free when he embraces Islam, and treated as a man and a brother, for ""all true believers are brethren."" In many cases he rises to the highest offices of State, his race and colour being no impediment to his advancement. In what part of Christendom would the same toleration be displayed? The descendants of those who robbed the poor of their patrimony in Reformation times would be horrified at the idea of a negro filling the position of Cabinet Minister, however grand his abilities might be. The professed abhorrence of English society for the institution of slavery can be estimated at its right value by those who remember the sympathy exhibited by the British nobility and gentry for the slave owning oligarchy of the Southern States during the Rebellion. The evils of Arabian slavery are not so bad as those resulting from the system of modern capitalism, and the trade itself is often an obstacle to the capacity of European adventurers, greedy for cheap labour, cheap ivory, and markets into which to shoot cheap home-made goods.'}, {'id': 6209, 'article_title': 'The British Operations in the Gambia', 'full_section_title': 'The British Operations in the Gambia', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_05_1892#article-4', 'issue_date': '02_05_1892', 'content': 'The pushing forward of the line of civilisation northwards has been slow, considering the richness of the country.

He knew that the impression they had acquired from various sources was that the beneficent results were enormous; but he had been enabled to see for himself the nature of those results and to draw his own conclusions, and he appeared before them to put a pin into the beautiful iridescent bubble which they had blown for themselves with the materials supplied by the ignorant, the interested, the colour-blind, and the hopelessly biassed. Taking a bird's-eye view of the whole situation in time and space, so that each factor might assume its proper relative position and proportion, he unhesitatingly affirmed in the plainest language that so far their intercourse with African races, instead of being a blessing, had been little better than an unmitigated curse to them. These were strong statements, they would say, and required confirmation. If true, what could possibly have caused this frightful miscarriage of the noblest aspirations of a Christian people? The answer was simply the nature of their commerce with Africa in the past and present. To the slave and gin trades, and that in gunpowder and guns, must he ascribed the frightful evils they had brought upon the negro race, beside which the good they had tried to achieve was hardly discernible."", 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MR.

Well, if compensating the slave-holders meant atonement, then they might rest in peace. But where, he asked, was the compensation to Africa for the frightful legacy of crime and degradation they had left behind? Where was the reparation and atonement for the millions torn from their homes and the millions massacred, for a land laid waste, for the further warping of the rudimentary moral ideas of myriads of people, and the driving of them into ten-fold lower depths of savagery than they had known before the European era? For answer it would no doubt be said that ""legitimate commerce"" had replaced the vile traffic in human flesh and blood. Still the same old story—legitimate commerce—magic words which gave such a glamour to whatever could creep under their shelter—words which had too often blinded a gullible public to the most shameful and the most criminal transactions. They would perhaps tell him that every trading station, once the slave traffic was stopped, became the handmaiden of Christianity and civilisation, a beacon of light and leading, before which barbarism was bound to disappear. That was what he once thought the rôle which the trading stations was enacting in the dark depths of Africa, but over the greater part of the Continent it was not so at present, and had not been so in the past. He was there that night to speak the truth as it appeared to him, and it was this—that, taken as a whole, their trading stations on the greater part of the West Coast of Africa, instead of being centres of beneficent and elevating influences, had been in the past disease-breeding spots which had infected with a blighting and demoralising poison the whole country around. They had been centres of corruption, where men had coined money out of the moral and physical ruin of the tribes they supplied. This had been the result of the legitimate commerce that was to benefit the negro. What did they think had been the character of this so-called legitimate commerce? It consisted to an enormous extent of vile spirits and weapons of destruction—the one, to ruin the buyers; the other to enable them to slaughter their neighbours.\n\nThe lecturer went on to refer to the results of the gin traffic, which, he said, only received a more powerful stimulus with the stoppage of the slave trade.

The thousands of lives sacrificed during the past few years in mischievous raids upon native tribes cannot be restored, nor can the scandal be atoned for of lawless floggings and tortures inflicted by English officials, who appear to have discarded all the qualities proper to Englishmen upon taking service in the Gold Coast or Sierra Leone Constabulary.\n\nIn the Gold Coast Colony a Government official gave twenty natives, who were suspected of complicity in a theft, seventy-two lashes apiece, from which flogging four of them died.

It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

This pamphlet throws a strong light upon a matter of which, perhaps, most people, even of those specially interested in the regeneration of Africa, have heard but little. The evidence now brought together goes to prove that in certain parts the wages of native labourers are paid, even in the case of mere boys and girls, in spirits, and that as a result, in some places, after the first hour or so, labour is unprocurable on account of the drunkenness of the people. ""The idea of drinking spirits is inseparable from the notion of European life in the ken of the natives. Owing to the relaxing climate of the rivers, there are few factories which cannot tell their tale of hard drinking and certain death as a consequence. But we are repeating an oft-told story, and those who read these pages have probably made themselves acquainted with the state of the West Coast in some degree. ... Competition is relentless; times are very bad; palm oil has fallen to a ruinous rate. But the degradation of the tribes of West Africa has reached a depth which is appalling."" Few men are more fitted to testify concerning the extent to which liquor trafficking with the native races of Africa has reached than Mr. Jas. Irvine, of Liverpool; and the following extract from a communication from him speaks volumes: ""It is very difficult to give you an account of the ramifications of the drink traffic on the West Coast of Africa—not because there is little to be said, but because it is only a repetition of the oft-told story in every part of the world. The extent of the trade is so prodigious that I think the following estimate of the quantity annually poured into the delta of the Niger relieves me from the necessity of further remark concerning this evil. ... I am sure I do not over-estimate the quantity when I put it down at 60,000 hogsheads of 50 gallons each as the annual consumption in the rivers."" We have in the native African one whose natural character is so weak that he easily becomes a victim when a dead set is made at him by those who are able to influence him. One needs go no further than the store-house of the first West African factory to know what is the native\'s weak point, and the form of the attack made upon it. His propensity to strong drink has been pandered to until things could hardly be worse with him. Mr. Joseph Thomson, the eminent African traveller, recently laid before the members of the Manchester Geographical Society his views upon this subject, and which fully support what has been already said: ""In the notorious gin trade lies a greater evil even than slavery. It is indeed a scandal and a shame. ... We talk of civilizing the negro and introducing the blessings of European trade, while at the same time we pour into this unhappy country incredible quantities of gin, rum, gunpowder, and guns. ... The trade in spirits is simply enormous. The appetite for it increases out of all proportion to the desire for better things; and, to our shame be it said, we are ever ready to supply the victims to the utmost, driving them deeper and deeper into the slough of depravity, while at home we talk sanctimoniously as if the introduction of our trade and the elevation of the negro went hand in hand.""

For the sake of a few paltry hundreds a-year, this country, which is spending half-a-million annually on the naval squadron for suppressing the slave-trade, delivers over the people of an extensive region to this monster enormity. We called attention, some twelve months ago, to the active operations of the slavetraders at Quittah, since the virtual abandonment of that place by the British authorities. We stated then that many hundred slaves, from Ashantee and the Volta districts, had passed Quittah by the Lagoons and sea coast for shipment, at a place nearer to the King of Dahomey\'s port of Whydah, which our readers will see in our Dahoman news the King calls ""the English town of Whydah."" And now it seems that so far from anything having been done by the British Government to put an end to such practices, the trade has gone on constantly increasing, until it has destroyed the legitimate commerce which before existed, and which ought to have been fostered with the extremest assiduity and care. What makes the matter more serious is, the declared inability of the authorities on the Gold Coast to take any efficient measures for remedying this great and crying evil.\n\nBut we are sure that our friends will agree with us in insisting, with Her Majesty\'s Government, that the evil shall be remedied, and that without further loss of time.

We have by it become really implicated as a nation in that slave-trade which we are, at the same time, making such expensive efforts to suppress.

It is now nearly twelve months since Lagos was pointed out to us, as at one and the same time carrying on an extensive slave-trade, and recruiting the ranks of domestic slavery within the colony; unchecked, though we never can admit that it could have been unobserved, by the British authorities there; and until then not denounced, or publicly rebuked, either by Christian missionaries or the admitted and acknowledged members of their respective churches. The European missionaries, and the native pastors and teachers, all, we are bound to presume, deeply imbued with the principles and precepts inculcated by Him who preached the Sermon on the Mount, are not few in number; while the communicants in the churches may be counted by hundreds. How is it to be accounted for, that of this not inconsiderable body of British officials and missionaries, and native pastors, teachers, and communicants, not one, until our correspondent addressed us on the subject,—not one, we say, entered the lists against what they know to be as abominable in the eyes of British law, as it is repugnant to the spirit of that Christianity which they all profess? We can only account for it by what seems to be the fact, that as we have stated, the whole atmosphere of Africa is so tainted by the spirit of the slave-trade and of slavery, that to inhale it produces a moral and spiritual torpor, from which only an exceptionally vigorous and sensitive conscience can free itself. Under such circumstances, an independent and uncompromising public Press is manifestly a vital necessity for Africa, if the hope is to be indulged of her ever being reclaimed from that abyss of misery and degradation, of moral filth and spiritual loathsomeness into which she has been plunged, by the long-continued dominion within her of the most debasing superstitions and vices that ever fettered humanity. Regard it as they may in the vitiated atmosphere they breathe on the African Coast, and familiarized as they are with the abominable evil, so as to be perhaps unconscious of its ruinous tendencies, our African readers may rest assured that the material progress which is so important for them as regards their trading operations, depends in a very great degree on the extent to which freedom shall replace slavery. These readers of ours, we are told, comprise every African on the West Coast who has any pretension whatever to be classed as an educated man. We call upon them all to lay this truth seriously to heart. If they desire the development of the resources of the countries that supply the produce in which they trade, they should use all their influence, individually and collectively, against those gigantic paralyzers of human energies for purposes of good, the slave-trade and slavery. Their eye should not pity, their heart should not spare, any one among themselves whose covetousness, or other vile and debasing lusts, may lead him to dishonour the education that has been bestowed upon him, by buying or selling his fellow-creatures. The letters from Lagos and Cape Coast, to which we gave insertion in our August number, show, unhappily, how very necessary it is that we place these truths clearly and constantly before them, so long as God may grant us the energy and means to do so. The Hydra of African slavery must be killed. We have pledged ourselves to a war of extermination against it. Every educated man and woman on the West Coast ought to be active and energetic soldiers in our army. Thanks especially to the exertions of our noble missionary societies, there is now no inconsiderable number of educated women on the Coast; women, Christians too we hope in reality, as well as in profession, in addition to being educated. This great question of the total disappearance of slavery from among them; of that horribly debasing, degrading institution, under which members of their own sex may be purchased—victims in body and soul—ministers to lust and to every brutal passion, for a few pounds sterling, or dollars, or pieces of cloth, or bags of cowries—this question, we repeat, touches them nearly. The position that they and their educated female children may occupy; the greater or less consideration with which they will be regarded and treated, depends in no small degree, on the continuance or annihilation of female domestic slavery. They must—it is inevitable—they must be included, more or less, in the degradation that falls upon their human sisters. We call upon them to regard it as an accursed thing; as striking at the very root of that elevation of themselves in the community, to which their sex has attained in the Christian countries of Europe. We call upon them to look at it as the forbidden spoil in the tent of Achan, bringing a curse upon the whole community to which the culprit belongs. It is quite time that the educated women in Africa, particularly in the British settlements, where they are under the protection of British laws, should make their purifying influence felt in this vital matter. It is for them to cast a halo of purity and of Christian love around; to show in practice as in word, that they love their poorer sisters as themselves. It is only thus that there can be any hope of the purification of African society; any hope of that material as well as Christian advancement, which can alone raise Africa from the degraded position it holds in European opinion; a position owing in no small degree to that abominable slave-trade and slavery, which we call upon them to use their utmost efforts to eradicate.', 'last_edit_date': '1877-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1877#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COMMERCIAL DEPRESSION ON THE WEST COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The most unpleasant side of the question to me is that, after these inexperienced European merchants have so imprudently supplied goods to adventurous traders without securities, or worthless securities (and many a time without any reference to the Coast respecting the pecuniary status or reputation of the consignee), they are only too ready to brand all Africans as a race of dishonest robbers. A certain Manchester merchant, in writing to a friend on this subject, lately said, ""I have lost £60,000 on the coast of Africa, £30,000 of which I have lost in Lagos."" Now, Mr. Editor, the class of men this particular merchant credited is almost beyond belief. One of the effects of this system which have to be deplored is the serious and unwarrantable competition that follows, to the detriment of capitalists. The debtor merchant being sure that he would never possibly pay his creditor in full, for the purpose of giving temporary impetus to the trade, will undersell capitalists and over-top them in buying produce, and with these large shipments or remittances generally baffle their unwary creditors, and secure more confidence and larger credits. They are spoken of as big traders, enterprising men, and such like; it matters not whether the produce shipped has been surreptitiously received and not paid for. The result is that the honest capitalists are threatened with ruin, as they cannot come into open conflict with the fraudulent merchants in their ruinous competitive undertakings, as the latter have nothing to lose. The *Lagos Times*, in its issue of the 10th August, 1881, in inveighing in strong terms against the credit system of Lagos, says: ""There is a great facility afforded by it (the credit system) for dishonest and dishonourable transactions. Distance between here and Europe enables one who solicits credit to exaggerate the market value of the property he tenders to a creditor for security, and thus obtains a considerably larger supply than the true value of his property would have warranted; and there are never wanting those who are ready to swear anything, who would solemnly affirm to the alleged estimated value being a fair and just one. They are anxious, perhaps, to help their friend, and this they scruple not to do at the expense of their own better convictions, and of the wholesome advice that we should be just and true to all men alike; and so it has often come to pass that properties are encumbered with debts three times their market value at the time those debts were contracted. . . . Further, the system opens a way for extravagance, and renders it easy for those who are not careful to get into debt. It cannot be denied that men are generally more careful of that which they have earned by their own independent honest industry than of that which is left to them by others, or is given them on credit; and that they would sometimes have dispensed with that which they readily take on credit if they had had to pay for it at once out of their savings.

This trade, once inaugurated, was carried on by the Egyptians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and Europeans down to the end of the last century, when the revival of human feeling urged certain philanthropists in England to move towards the abolition of a great evil. But during all this period the negro himself was as much to blame as the white and yellow men; indeed, it was probable that negroes were enslaving negroes long before Egyptian or Arab bought black servants from the negro chiefs, and at the present day there would be no slavery in Africa if an approval of slavery were not present in the philosophy of the negro tribes of Africa. Slavery and the slave trade, with the tribal wars and their attendant insecurity, had been the cause of Africa's backward condition, and if ever that Continent were to be raised to the civilisation of Europe, slavery and the slave trade must be extirpated. The two great slave markets which, until a few years ago, had existed in America, and in Turkey and Persia rendered the inducements to slave traders so great that the guarding of the coasts of Africa by British cruisers only checked the trade in a very slight degree; and even now many slaves were sent to Arabia, Persia, and Madagascar. In the present day, however, Africa was the main consumer of its own slaves. The most remarkable revival of the slave trade and occurred in German East Africa. The Germans, under Major Von Wissmann, began by suppressing a revolt of the Arab slave dealers, which led to the almost complete extinction of the oversea slave traffic on the German coast of East Africa; but the organisation of a strong government led to the rapid settling down of the Arabs as great landed proprietors, with an unlimited number of slaves to work their plantations. Legally slavery could not exist in German territory, but in such a wide and sparsely populated region it was impossible to prevent it in fact; and as the slaves were ordinarily well and kindly treated, it never occurred to them to want to leave their masters or to better their condition. It might be asked where, then, was the harm of slavery? The harm lay in this, that slavery commenced with an initial evil. The speaker then drew a picture of the loss of life, devastation of countries, and breaking of family ties which attended a capture of slaves. This depopulation of whole regions was attended with another evil, the return of the dreaded tsetse fly; and the surest way of extirpating this pest was to encourage population in the fertile districts of Central Africa.

The boom at Kaka was partly connected with the abolition of the slave trade in the Turkish-controlled Sudan in 1854. It became the main slave market of the White Nile, and its immigrant population swelled rapidly. The activities of the freebooter, Muhammad al-Khäyr, a Dongalawi by birth, who moved to Kaka from Taqali in 1854, may also have facilitated the transformation of Kaka into a slave market. 25 It is estimated that by i860, an average of 2000 slaves were being sold annually at Kaka and, to acquire this number, Khâyr and his slave gangs were terrorizing the whole Shilluk countryside.$^{2}$^ The southerners refused to co-operate with the traders and actively resisted their presence in their land.

Farther east the Nile routes continued to carry slaves even into the early twentieth century. 33 The firearms trade into and across the desert also continued, despite attempts by European powers to stop it. At Tripoli, and especially at Benghazi, a lively firearms trade was reported in the early 1880s, and many smuggled rifles, especially eighteen-shot Winchester repeaters, were imported for use by caravan escorts. But some of these modern weapons must have reached other nomadic groups as well, allowing them to mount successful raids because firepower added to the tactical advantages of surprise that raiding parties already enjoyed.$^{34}$ The penetration of modern repeaters into the desert seems to have been greatest along the BenghaziWadai route, but other areas were affected as well; Joseph Smaldone has assembled evidence to show that a turning point in the spread of firearms occurred among Ahaggar Tuareg in the 1890s. To the north-west, in Morocco, contraband sales of the i860 model single-shot Remington breechloader were so great that by the end of the century it had become the basic rifle for many groups throughout the country, including preSaharan nomads. Although the evidence is far from complete, increased insecurity on the Tripoli-Kano route after 1898 may have been due to the spread of firearms to raiders. 35 The region surrounding the southern terminus of the Tripoli-Kano trade route provides an example of the economic, political, and religious influence of desert people on the Sudan.

The slaves were carried in caravans of several hundreds and transported to the Ethiopian coast for shipment at the ports of Berbera, Zeila, Tajura, Assab, Obock and Massawa, from where they were ferried across the Red Sea to the ports of Jeddah, Mocha, and Hoideida. Buyers came from several towns in the Yemen and the Hidjâz. There were also seaborne traders from the Hadramawt, Zanzibar, Oman, India and the Persian Gulf. This trade was largely in Arab hands backed by Indian financiers from the Gujarat (Banians). 6\nThe major source of supply of slaves to Asia was, however, eastern Africa. As pointed out by J. B. Kelly,$^{7}$ the slave trade from Zanzibar was virtually a monopoly of the Muscat Arabs and their rulers who derived their revenue mostly from the custom duties levied on the trade. In the early nineteenth century, Muscat was the greatest clearing house of the traffic to the Gulf, Persia, Irak and India, but as the century wore on its dominance was to be challenged by the port of Sur to the southward. The majority of the slaves landed at Muscat were sold within Oman itself. The rest were bought by agents from the Trucial Coast, notably the Kawâsim, for resale on the coast or in the markets of Persia, Irak, Bahrain, Kuwait, Hasa and Nadj. From Muscat and Sur, slaves were also conveyed to the ports of SindhTKutch, Kathiawar and the Bombay Presidency, in Bahraini, Kuwaiti and Indian bottoms. Those intended for the Persian market were landed at Bushire as well as brought across the Gulf to Lingah from Sharjah.

As in the case of West Africa, the slave trade figured prominently in the process by which the region, especially north of the Zambezi river, became part of the periphery of the international trading system. Despite some basic similarities, there were important differences. Many of the captives were exported to the Indian Ocean plantation system, Madagascar and the Middle East rather than to the New World. There was also the very significant role of the ivory trade, and the fact that the far-reaching changes accompanying this involvement in international trade were compressed into a much shorter time-frame. Moreover, the level of violence that accompanied the slave trade was probably higher in Central Africa, creating unprecedented fragmentation and rural dislocation. While some Central African trading societies, or at least the dominant class within them, benefited in the short run through their participation in the ivory and slave trade, they ultimately became subordinate to and dependent upon the international trading system whose centres of decision-making lay outside Africa. 22 Several factors operated simultaneously to expand the slave trade during the first half of the nineteenth century. As a result of the resurgence of the plantation system in north-eastern Brazil and the subsequent development of sugar estates in Cuba, slave-traders in appreciable numbers from the West Indies and Latin America began to visit Mozambican ports where captives were generally cheaper than in West Africa and the limited British naval force far less intimidating.$^{23}$ Simultaneously, French planters on the islands of Bourbon (now called RØunion), Seychelles and the Mascarenes, as well as the rulers of Madagascar, intensified their demand for slaves. The most significant stimulant, however, was the development of clove plantations on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba shortly after the turn of the century. 24 Conditions within Central Africa facilitated the growing demand for slave labour. Bisa, Yao and Chikunda trade networks already linked the interior to the coastal markets of Kilwa, Mozambique Island and Quelimane. Despite their initial emphasis on ivory, the inland traders had always brought a small but steady supply of slaves to these international entrepôts. The use of captives as ivory porters facilitated the addition of a larger slave component without disrupting the commerce in elephant tusks.

Around the 1840s, trade that relied on the use of the western routes declined while trade by way of the routes of the central Sahara thrived, especially between Tripoli and Kano and between Tripoli and Borno. In addition, a new direct link between Wadaïand Barka, discovered in 1809 or 18 10, became a major caravan route after 1850.93 During the latter half of the century the slave trade went into a slow decline, although along the Borno route it continued longer and along the Wadaï route it even increased and went on doing so after 1900.94 Ivory exports, which were fairly stable, peaked around 1877. The place of slaves as items of trade was taken first by ostrich feathers, mainly from 1878 to 1883, and then by hides, especially goatskins. To these were added fabrics dyed with indigo, from the Hausa country a small quantity ofgold and a few other sundry articles. English cotton goods were the main item to be carried southwards. In i860 they represented some 70 per cent of the value of imports. Other imports consisted of North African woollen garments from Tripolitania, Austro-Hungarian textiles, woollen goods and carpets, ironmongery, medicines, devotional articles, perfumes, jewellery, silks, pearls and above all, weapons and ammunition. In addition, there was a constant demand for salt from the Sahara, dates from oases and cereals from the Sahel. 95 Trans-Saharan trade did not undergo a decline until Atlantic shipping and overland transport (railways) in West Africa began to constitute com› petitive alternatives. Political developments played a secondary though important role. The fortunes of Wadai account for the importance of the Wadai-Barka route as early as 1850.

A case in point is that of the Kel-Ewey Tuareg, who expanded their economy during the nineteenth century, a time of good climate in the region, achieved prosperity from trans-Saharan trade and salt trade, and made growing investments in the entire region centring on the corridor from the Air to Kano. Little information is available on the evolution of systems of social stratification in the desert except among other Tuareg groups. The new reliance on agriculture based on servile labour in Ahaggar has been mentioned, and among the Kel-Gress and the Tuareg of the Imannen emphasis shifted from the use of slave labour in herding to the collection of tribute from sedentary agriculturalists. This reorientation came about when desert warriors arrived in areas of the Sahel where agriculture was possible and demanded tribute from local cultivators, or raided for slaves, who in times merged with the sedentary tribute-paying population.$^{30}$ Another case of economic expansion also suggests that there was a need for additional slave labour, namely the imperialism of the Ait Atta, a group that had been on the move in the pre-Saharan fringe of Morocco since the seventeenth century. In the nineteenth century, the Ait Kabbash, a segment of the Ait Atta, led the desert vanguard of this expansion by extending their influence over trade between Tafilâlet and Tüwät and extorting protection money from the inhabitants of Tüwät. 31 Little is known about the volume of the slave trade across the desert, but Ralph Austen has compiled preliminary estimates, based on a wide variety of sources, and these offer some surprises. According to Austen, the commerce in human beings, far from declining in the nineteenth century, was actually on the rise; a greater volume of trade reached receiving areas in North Africa and the Middle East than in any previous century. Austen's figures show that between 1800 and 1880 something in the order of half a million slaves entered Egypt, and a quarter of a million were taken to Morocco.

In practice, however, the provinces had long considered the suzerainty of the Kâramânlï to be of little conse› quence and tended to act independently. The French military conquest of the Regency of Algiers in 1830 turned into colonization from 1842 onwards, and the white settlers had little desire to employ slave labour. Caught between French and British pressures, the neighbouring Regency of Tunis abolished the trade between 1840 and 1842. Further east, the Regency of Tripoli had more obstacles to overcome because it had to obtain the consent of chieftains in the hinterland, some of whom were powerful middlemen in the trade in slaves from Borno or Sokoto. In 1842, Shaykh 'Abd alDjalil, who dominated the Fezzân from his stronghold at Murzuk, did agree to the abolition of the trade, but he was murdered. Turkey had re› established direct rule over Tripoli and Cyrenaica in 1835 and it was thenceforth clear that the effective abolition of the trade depended on the Turkish attitude towards it. The Sultan of Constantinople banned the trade in 1857, but it was not really interrupted anywhere, not even in Egypt, in spite of the growing Western influence. In 1870, the German traveller Georg Schweinfurth, who had arrived from 'the heart of Africa', wondered what kind of assistance abolition of the trade was likely to receive from the Khedive.$^{21}$ Morocco was a case apart. It was the only country in the Maghrib regarded by the Europeans as a power to be reckoned with, and diplomatic initiatives and humanitarian coaxings were unavailing there until 1887. At a time when the Atlantic slave trade was beginning to show signs of waning, the trans-Saharan trade could still rely on secure routes for the export and distribution of slaves. They ran, on one hand, to Morocco, which was importing from 3500 to 4000 black Africans a year in the middle of the nineteenth century and 500 a year as late as the"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The Middle East and south-east Asia 5', 'content': 'British and Dutch slavers also participated in this lucrative trade.

This interaction of peoples of varied backgrounds merits further study. 10 The annual pilgrimage to Mecca also played an important, albeit a seasonal, role in the involuntary and voluntary movements of Africans to the Middle East. Many West African pilgrims reached Mecca via the Cairo caravan or by way of the Red Sea ports of Suäkin and Massawa, thereby constituting small diaspora communities.""

In areas dominated by British and Dutch colonial powers, especially in India and the Malay archipelago, slaves, including Africans, provided the base of a plantation economy similar to that found in the Americas.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

Produce came in from Sokoto, Benue, Nupe, north-western Cameroon and the inner delta area, procured by the traditional methods: warring, kidnapping, in settlement of debts, payment of protection tribute, community purges, straightforward purchase on the market, and straight› forward gift. It was taken via chains of dealers, or the usual supply channels, to the distribution points.$^{27}$ There again, transactions were governed by well-tried procedures. The price per slave had been fixed in advance in the local money of account, the copper bar, equivalent to a specific quantity of goods - the same as in earlier periods. In 1825 and 1829 men and women were worth 67 bars, and the price went down as low as 45 or 50. In terms of the value of the landed cargo, the price per slave was 33 Spanish dollars, of which 8-10 per cent went to the distributors by way of commission. At Duke Town, Duke Ephraim's city in Old Calabar, the heads of other more or less rival houses, Egbo Eyo, Tom Honesty and Ogan Henshaw, helped to make up cargoes with slaves or foodstuffs. Forty thousand yams cost 2000 bars, the price of forty slaves.

On the contrary, ivory exports also increased substantially as African merchants tried to satisfy the new markets in Britain and the USA as well as their traditional Asian clients. 25 As the demand for cheap labour and ivory skyrocketed, Yao, Bisa and Chikunda merchants expanded their commercial empires. The Yao penetrated into the Lake Nyasa region during the first half of the century and, after 1850, entered the Shire valley in search of new markets among the Manganja and Chewa. Simultaneously, they established commercial ties to the Indian Ocean port of Ibo, which became a major export centre. The Chikunda, initially in the service of Afro-Portuguese and Afro-Goan prazeros, extended their commercial contacts from the area immediately north of the Zambezi to the Luangwa valley and south into what is now Zimbabwe, while the Bisa intensified their operations in the territory between the Shire and Luapula valleys. All three groups continued to emphasize the ivory component of the trade as well and in the case of the Bisa traders it remained the dominant export commodity. 26 By the middle of the nineteenth century Central Africa had become a major supplier of slaves. Annual exports from Quelimane to Brazil, for example, had increased by 400 per cent between 1800 and 1835.$^{27}$ The newly developed port of Ibo on Mozambique Island, and Kilwa, were doing a booming business, while the post-1844 resurgence of the sultanate of Angoche was directly related to its entrance into the slave trade, and even the southern Mozambican ports of Inhambane and Lourenço Marques, largely ignored by European slavers, became important sec› ondary entrepôts.$^{28}$ Zanzibar remained the principal recipient of these captives, with annual imports increasing from 10 000 per annum in 1810 to at least 20000 in 1850.$^{29}$ Paralleling this growth was a proportionate increase in ivory exports. 30 As the involvement of Angoche suggests, the economic pre-eminence of the Yao, Chikunda and Bisa did not go unchallenged for long.

This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

Their learned observation endorses the popular view. But the proposition needs explanation. Humanitarianism is a Western ideology, and it is unlikely to have found any place in the minds of African distributors of the time - with very rare exceptions. But this does not mean that they were constitutionally incapable of giving up the trade, as Western supporters of slavery maintained. The continuance of the supply of exportable manpower from Africa can be logically explained in economic terms. That the distributors were black and the exporters white is irrelevant: it was a paying proposition, profitable to both trading partners, whose sole object was to make money. That was the situation at the grass roots. The continuance of the supply is to be explained in terms of the efficient working of an integrated system: and what Africans were resisting was the disruption of this system. For one thing, it would have ruined the established business of the distributors,$^{31}$ who had no other prospects, to say nothing of the chain of repercussions it would have set off on the social and political structure, both locally and further afield. In other words, so long as the barter system between the hinterland and the coast, and the coast's foreign trade, had no clear alternative to the slave trade, opposition by African slave-traders to its suppression was dictated strictly by the imperative needs to avoid commercial chaos.$^{32}$ The supposed complicity of the African distributors was no more than a reflex reaction to the immediate economic situation. This also explains the fall in the selling price of exportable manpower: it was the market's defence against growing pressure from the forces of suppression. The latter thus helped to contribute to an unsatisfactory situation. This argument needs to be modi› fied when the exportation of Africans to the north or east is considered. While the economic interests of the slave hunters and distributors are selfevident in this case too, it is hard to see what kind of economic compensa› tion accrued to the countries that were plundered.

They are now seldom brought in large companies to Cairo, but they are brought so from the Soodan and Osiout and other places up the river. From these points, from one to five at a time are brought to Cairo on grain boats and other vessels. If any questions are asked, the captains, with a little backsheesh to confirm their story, can easily pass so small a number of supernumeraries as wives, children, servants, or sailors. From Boolak, the port of Cairo, these slaves are retailed, as there may be opportunity, to persons who want their services. If the vessel must move before such opportunity occurs, they are sold to a dealer, who buys cheaper than the retail purchasers. My friend told me that he had a number of black slaves, but said he had allowed them to marry, and had given them free papers, that their service with him was voluntary, and in the event of his death they would be safe from the claims of heirs and creditors. It is common for Egyptians, who know that almost all Christendom opposes the institution, to make such apologies to frank acquaintances, but in this case I believe the statement was correct.\n\n""This conversation increased my curiosity and strengthened my determination to see the Cairo slave-pen if possible.

He came to me in a minute, and told me that if the dealer pressed any one of his women on me, I must object that they were too old; that my wife wanted a girl young enough to be trained to take intelligent care of the children.

Man-hunting, which supplies the victims for these markets, is not only encouraged by the brutal ferocity of the chief of a tribe; it is considered an act commanded by religion.\n\nThe Sultan, who goes to make razzias at the head of warriors, with whom he divides the booty, by an impious aberration believes that he performs a pious work in spreading devastation around him.

Oxen are riches; perhaps the most esteemed by uncivilized populations.\n\nThe negroes have a similar destiny, and are sometimes given in payment to the very traffickers who had been employed in carrying them off.\n\nThe French merchant employed an Arab smuggler and horse-jockey to exchange slaves for horses, but nevertheless, with a bold front, professed to be at the head of a house as honest in its character as it was flourishing in its condition. He assumed the refined manners of a gentleman; but in these expeditions he signalised himself as a finished barbarian; nevertheless it is probable that there is put to his account a portion of the glory of his rivals.\n\nHistory, which loves to simplify statements, sometimes heaps upon certain heroes all the exploits of an entire generation.

The other facts remain, and the principle involved is in no way affected. The promises of Oriental Governments to suppress slavery are not to be depended upon, and our Government in parading such promises is either misled or is misleading the public. The only effect of consular \'representations\' is that the traffic is more carefully cloaked and rendered more difficult to deal with. Mr. Bourke is reported to have informed the House recently that the officials here are in the habit of seizing the slaves brought for sale. The statement is altogether delusive. There are police regulations authorising the seizure of slaves upon arrival here; but the only occasions upon which they are acted upon are either when some Pacha has notified he is in want of extra blacks, or when the dealer has demurred to the amount of \'backsheesh\' demanded by the officials for passing them. In the latter case the slaves are taken to the Zaptieh till new masters are found for them—which is a question of hours only—they are then handed over, their new proprietors paying for them, and receiving a document which, while purporting to be the manumission of the unfortunates, is really the receiver\'s title to them.""\n\n*Alexandria, May 10.*—The expedition for the suppression of slavery, consisting of Morica Bey, Fedrigo Bey, and Dr. Lowe, has returned from its inspection of the ports in the Red Sea and the Egyptian steamers.

In almost every number appear notices of sales of slaves with prices and descriptions, the prices varying from 25 to 60 dollars, according to age and good looks. A leading article in one of these papers commences as follows: ""Better late than never. At length we breathe freely. A great load which oppressed our heart has been raised.

She began work, and her wages added to what she had received from her former master enabled her to save a moderate sum of money. One day, passing through a street, she heard the auctioneer selling a negress. The conscience of the former slave was touched and her sympathy aroused by the remembrance of her former life. In a spirit of sublime charity she bought the slave, took her to her own house, and declared her free, and the two women are now working contentedly together.

Why, his brother man; he procures such for his own benefit by razzias over the surrounding peoples, or over his own subjects, so long as these latter have not embraced Islamism."" In order to understand the abominations connected with the Eastern slave trade, we must rid ourselves of our European ideas, and enter a new world, in which men and events have in store for us more than one subject of surprise.\n\nIt is easy to form an opinion as to the importance of this slave traffic in this region, when we know the extent of the caravans that convey the negroes from Kouka. During many weeks, the preparations and the departure fill the capital with noise and bustle. Long files of camels are laden with provisions, two thousand armed men serve as an escort, and the human flock altogether counts four thousand heads. For the Sultan, for his horsemen, for his wholesale merchants, for the entire city, the caravan season is a great annual festivity; for the slave, it is the moment of banishment, the renewal of sufferings, and perhaps the eve of his death. Very speedily all this multitude has taken a northern direction, and soon it disappears from the side of the desert.\n\nBut this crowd of unhappy beings, these miserable creatures of all ages—children, young men, old men and women—where are they going? What agricultural or industrial labour demands them from the Eastern coast? What route will they take, since the north of Africa, the borders of the Mediterranean, belong to those Powers which proscribe the traffic? It is on account of these apparent difficulties, and because of the mysteries in which the Oriental trade has been involved, that it has been able to conceal itself, until the present day, from the observation of Europe.\n\nWe refrain, for the moment, from replying to the first of these inquiries.

But how is this to be done? It is easy enough to forbid slavery; the difficulty lies in the enforcement of the prohibition. Successive Foreign Secretaries have appealed to the Khedive to suppress the trade. The Government of Egypt is bound by a Convention, made some years ago, to put an end to it. Yet it is notorious that slaves are still to be bought at Cairo. The reconquest of the Soudan would not destroy the trade; it would only alter the route taken by the slave-dealers. General Gordon did more than any Governor had done before or has done since to suppress the traffic; yet at the end of several years of heroic labour he admitted that he had failed. He could not stop the supply of slaves, though he raised their price. Under the old régime not more than 10 per cent. died on the way. General Gordon drove the dealers from their old routes, with the result that 80 or 90 per cent. of their slaves succumbed before they reached the market. There will always be slavery where harems flourish.

Constantinople, November 9.—An English steamer arrived here on Wednesday from Malta with twenty slaves on board. The traffic in slaves between Tripoli and Constantinople, via Malta, is very brisk."" Few, we believe, will have been prepared for such an announcement as this. Yet, although it appeared in all our daily papers, we have not seen any other notice taken in them of the alleged facts—any condemnation of Turkey—any censure of ourselves. We have been holding public meetings in condemnation of the East African Slave Trade, the British Government has been sending out a special envoy to Zanzibar, and is understood to be adopting efficacious measures for putting an end to the traffic from Africa to Persia and Arabia—all highly commendable, and our most obvious duty—but yet here we have the Slave Trade, the foreign African Slave Trade, carried on under our very eyes—carried on where we can intercept and destroy it forthwith, if we so choose, without any extraordinary effort on our part to do so being required,—here we have it, duly exposed as an item of news in the columns of all the London daily papers, without its having elicited any justly indignant comments, provoked any addresses to Her Majesty\'s Government, or even, so far as we can learn (not having been ourself present), given rise to a single remark at the Baroness Burdett Coutts\' evening reunion, where a Wilberforce, the Bishop of Winchester, presided over the Anti-Slave Trade Conversazione. We should have imagined that, if any item of Slave Trade news could possibly excite attention and rouse indignation, it would be such an item as this. For what does this Mediterranean Slave Trade from Tripoli to Constantinople, in steamer via Malta, mean? Where do these poor wretches thus conveyed to their final destination, come from? Alas! they have previously formed part of one of those caravans of slaves which traverse the Great Desert, from Bornou, in Central Africa, to Tripoli, the whole route of which through that Desert is clearly marked by the bleached bones of innumerable human victims of that accursed trade, carried on in Central as in Eastern Africa by Mahomedans for the supply of Mahometan countries. We have been too long accustomed to hear that this Central African Slave Trade from Bornou to Tripoli (the intense horrors of which have been often exposed, and are again exposed in the little work by Mons. Berlioz, which we are reproducing in our columns) cannot be reached by any effort of the British Government. This assertion has been invariably denied by us. It has been well known that the final destination, the profitable market, for perhaps the greater portion of the survivors of those horrible caravans, was in Turkey; and that, in some way or other, they were constantly being conveyed to Smyrna and Constantinople. Is it not, therefore, evident that a little energy and honest determination on the part of the British Government would suffice to break this final link in the chain of the traffic; and that without any very great sacrifices being necessary to effect it? There cannot be any reasonable doubt on this point; and there being no room for any such doubt, makes us to be clearly criminal participators in all the worst barbarities and horrors of that Central African Slave Trade, which we profess so vehemently to deplore and to condemn. Why are we so? Why is this, at least, nominally Christian country thus allowed to be dragged in the year 1873 through the gory mire of that accursed trade, which insults God and outrages humanity.

The letters are grouped under the name of the country to which they refer. Eighteen letters deal with Africa (from which Egypt is excluded) and Arabia. Several British ships were on the East Coast of Africa during the year, and a large number of slave vessels were caught and condemned; and tables appended to the report give particulars as to the number of vessels and the number and condition of slaves caught by Her Majesty’s ships. To this part belong other reports as to the slave importation between the two shores of the Red Sea (under the heads of Turkey and Italy) and as to Zanzibar. Under the head of Egypt we find thirty-two despatches, many of which refer to the capture of slave dhows and to the reception of fugitive slaves on board Her Majesty’s ships. Several returns are added, some of which, by Colonel Schaefer, the head of the Department for the Suppression of the Slave Trade, are interesting. Thus, in April, 1886, Colonel Schaefer states that in six months thirty-six persons, many of them professional dealers, had been tried by Court-martial for buying or selling slaves; of these thirteen were condemned, four acquitted, ten were still under judgment, and nine were released for want of evidence. The report as to the progress of the Home for Women Slaves in Cairo, founded by the efforts of Mr. Clifford Lloyd and Mrs. Sheldon Amos, is encouraging. In May, 1886, 170 women had been received into the Home, most of them negresses, a few Circassians, and a few Abyssinians. According to another report, drawn up by Colonel Schaefer, in the twelve months previous to May, 1885 (that is, before the Slavery Department took over the working of the Manumission Bureaux), the number of slaves freed in Egypt proper amounted to 1,032. In the following year that number increased to 2,786, of whom 853 were the property of Dongola refugees. In 1883 there were thirty-two slave dealers in Cairo; there are now only four or five, and they only act as brokers. The Anti-Slavery Society called the attention of the Government in September to the alleged transit of slaves through the Canal, and, in consequence, a strict watch was ordered to be kept at Suez, and some of these despatches relate to the liberation of slaves at that port.

The writer very forcibly demonstrates that even the best-intentioned measures against the traffic in slaves must fail so long as its great provocative, slavery, exists.

How is it, then, that the slave trade is still carried on in those countries, in violation both of law and treaty engagements?

Sturge (Chairman of the Anti-Slavery Society), and a number of clergy and laymen intimately and personally acquainted with the horrors of the African slave-trade. The Chairman said that the English people were at heart sound in maintaining the view held by our forefathers with respect to the iniquity of slavery. It was supposed by some that slavery was abolished, but that was far from being the fact. Although from the West Coast of Africa there was not as large an exportation of slaves as there used to be, still there was a very large exportation from the East Coast, and there was a great deal of slavery on the continent of Africa itself. Another field of slavery was Brazil, and the President of the Anti-Slavery Society and some colleagues were working in order to redeem that country from the taint of slavery. They were looking forward very hopefully to the day when Brazil would no longer be a slave country. Slavery also existed in Egypt. It was not in connection with agriculture that the slavery in Egypt prevailed, but it was associated with their domestic relations, the slaves being used in the household as servants, and purchased by wealthy persons as members of their harems. The Anti-Slavery Society hoped that the position of England in Egypt was such that her influence could be used to do away with all slavery in that country. The Society had been cordially supported by Lord Granville, and they had the entire sympathy of Lord Dufferin, who had expressed the view that it might be possible to introduce the seven years' system, so that at the end of seven years the slave-trade of Egypt might be abolished. Lord Granville, on the other hand, looking at the state of the Soudan, asked whether it would not be possible at once to make an end of slavery. The Society would use their influence to support the view of Lord Granville. They hoped that the great influence of England in Egypt would not be used to retain in power any Government which still permitted man to hold in captivity his fellow-man. Arrangements had been made for Mr. Baker to go to the Soudan to represent the Government in that portion of Egypt. He would have the power not merely to remain at Khartoum, but to act as a roving consul in that district; and from him the Government would be able to obtain full information of all that was going on. There were many other districts which needed to be carefully watched by the society. They hoped to see gradually developed among the nations of the world the civilization which Englishmen enjoyed, and, by the abolition of slavery, to remove one of the greatest barriers to the success of missionary work and the spread of the Gospel. The Rev. Horace Waller (late of South Africa, and a friend of Dr. Livingstone) gave details of the slave-trade in Africa, and said that it was now more rampant than ever in the centre and on the Eastern Coast of Africa. The Rev. C. T. Wilson (late of Uganda) spoke of the horrors of the slave-trade, as did also Archdeacon Farler (of Zanzibar), who said that he was greatly surprised at the ignorance of intelligent persons on the subject of slavery, many of them believing that it had been entirely put down by the English Government."", 'last_edit_date': '1883-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1883#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'East African Slave-Trade', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Letters from Aden state that the boats of one of the British slave-trade suppression steamers, cruising between Zanzibar and the Arabian coast, had recently captured a slave dhow with 236 slaves.

This trade, once inaugurated, was carried on by the Egyptians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and Europeans down to the end of the last century, when the revival of human feeling urged certain philanthropists in England to move towards the abolition of a great evil. But during all this period the negro himself was as much to blame as the white and yellow men; indeed, it was probable that negroes were enslaving negroes long before Egyptian or Arab bought black servants from the negro chiefs, and at the present day there would be no slavery in Africa if an approval of slavery were not present in the philosophy of the negro tribes of Africa. Slavery and the slave trade, with the tribal wars and their attendant insecurity, had been the cause of Africa's backward condition, and if ever that Continent were to be raised to the civilisation of Europe, slavery and the slave trade must be extirpated. The two great slave markets which, until a few years ago, had existed in America, and in Turkey and Persia rendered the inducements to slave traders so great that the guarding of the coasts of Africa by British cruisers only checked the trade in a very slight degree; and even now many slaves were sent to Arabia, Persia, and Madagascar. In the present day, however, Africa was the main consumer of its own slaves. The most remarkable revival of the slave trade and occurred in German East Africa. The Germans, under Major Von Wissmann, began by suppressing a revolt of the Arab slave dealers, which led to the almost complete extinction of the oversea slave traffic on the German coast of East Africa; but the organisation of a strong government led to the rapid settling down of the Arabs as great landed proprietors, with an unlimited number of slaves to work their plantations. Legally slavery could not exist in German territory, but in such a wide and sparsely populated region it was impossible to prevent it in fact; and as the slaves were ordinarily well and kindly treated, it never occurred to them to want to leave their masters or to better their condition. It might be asked where, then, was the harm of slavery? The harm lay in this, that slavery commenced with an initial evil. The speaker then drew a picture of the loss of life, devastation of countries, and breaking of family ties which attended a capture of slaves. This depopulation of whole regions was attended with another evil, the return of the dreaded tsetse fly; and the surest way of extirpating this pest was to encourage population in the fertile districts of Central Africa. They must not expect much from the people themselves.

L. Cameron, R.N., C.B. The Earl of Dundonald was in the chair.\n\nCommander Lovett Cameron, in the course of his opening remarks, said the slave trade went on all round the continent of Africa, and commerce had gone on with it. Our trade with the West Coast of Africa had gone on since the time of the Tudors. For centuries that trade was in slaves, and its increase was slow; but after several blows had been struck at that trade—among others by the liberation of slaves in the West Indian Islands, in America, and in Cuba—instead of their being any injury done to our commerce, our trade with the West Coast of Africa increased by leaps and bounds. It was only in 1850 or shortly after that we attacked a great nest of slave dealers in Lagos, and in 1861 it was made a British colony. Up to that time there had been no trade there except in slaves; but last year the trade of Lagos amounted to £357,831 imports, and £538,980 exports. And yet only thirty-eight years ago that place was of absolutely no value to us for legitimate commerce. On the Gold Coast slavery had been practically abolished by the British Government, but yet there was a good deal still existing owing to the native customs of the people. Even if the export of slaves from Africa was prevented entirely, the internal trade in them would still be enormous.\n\nFormerly the slave trade was subsidiary to the ivory trade, but when porters were no longer wanted for the latter, the former remained, only the men were killed and the women and children carried away. It had been said that domestic slavery must be allowed, and that was a very difficult question to settle. In his opinion, we should, as in India, abolish the legal status of slavery, but should not rout out all the households where no complaint was made. As long as domestic slavery existed there would be a market for slaves. We must have nothing to do with slavery; while the slave trade continued it was impossible for legitimate commerce to go on as it should! If the slave trade were done away with, they would find that all other trade would flourish.\n\nIn answer to questions Commander Lovett Cameron said he had avoided speaking of the Germans for diplomatic reasons.\n\nHe had a plan for the total abolition of slavery in Africa, which he hoped to explain shortly. It was, in brief, to establish a barricade across the country by the way of the lakes, and to get authority to maintain order on that line.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, on February 26, presided over a large meeting, held in Exeter Hall, when two African explorers, Commander Cameron and Captain Hore, were announced to speak.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-03-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_03_1889#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told. More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

1313,Efforts to suppress the slave trade in the Nile Valley and surrounding regions faced challenges due to the economy's reliance on illegal trafficking networks and the persistent demand for slave labor in East Africa and beyond.,"Efforts to suppress the slave trade in the Nile Valley and surrounding regions faced significant challenges due to the economy's reliance on illegal trafficking networks and the persistent demand for slave labor in East Africa and beyond. The General History of Africa textbook highlights the persistent demand for slave labor, particularly in the clove plantations of Zanzibar and Pemba, which relied heavily on slaves for economic expansion. This demand made it difficult to enforce decrees against the trade, as traders found ways to smuggle slaves despite legal prohibitions. European merchants, facing lower profit margins, exacerbated the situation by paying their Arab retainers in slaves, further intensifying the trade. The economic reliance on illegal networks is evident in the concealed stations along the coast and the use of small vessels to evade British naval patrols. The transformation of Kaka into a major slave market in the White Nile region, facilitated by figures like Muhammad al-Khäyr, underscores the entrenched nature of the trade in the economy. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize the economic reliance on trafficking networks, with significant investment in slave-trading expeditions on the White Nile, where at least four-fifths of the capital in Khartoum was tied to these activities. The persistent demand for slave labor is further illustrated by the movement of slaves to Zanzibar, Pemba, Lamu, and Brava, and the high demand in Pemba, Arabia, and the Persian Gulf. The complicity of local authorities, such as the Kaimakan's perquisite for allowing slave caravans through Mourzouk, and the lack of effective enforcement by European powers, compounded the challenges. However, the articles also note efforts by the Egyptian government and expeditions like Sir Samuel Baker's to combat the trade, indicating some opposition. Both sources corroborate the claim by illustrating the economic entrenchment and persistent demand that hindered suppression efforts.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that support the claim regarding the challenges faced in suppressing the slave trade in the Nile Valley and surrounding regions.

The answer is obvious if one bears in mind the nature of the expanding plantation economy in Zanzibar and Pemba. Its dependence on slave labour meant that restriction on the procurement of slaves would limit its growth. It is known that plantation agriculture continued to expand after the decree of 1873.$^{49}$ As slave-trading was still legal on the mainland coast, traders were able to transport slaves a long distance along the coast between Kilwa and Mombasa or even Malindi and smuggle them to Zanzibar, and especially Pemba, in small vessels at night in order to avoid the British naval patrol. Even after the slave trade was prohibited on the mainland in 1876, neither the sultan nor the British were in a position to enforce the decree effectively. The clove plantations on the islands had increased demand for food production on the mainland coast, especially grain. Thus, a number of plantations producing grain with slave labour had sprung up all along the coast between Pangani and Malindi. It was therefore impossible during this time to distinguish slaves intended for sale from those intended for use on these plantations.$^{50}$ To make things worse, this was the time when internal strife in many parts of the hinterland was producing large numbers of captives. The traders could easily invent new ways of evading the sultan's soldiers and the British naval patrol. A number of new concealed stations sprang up all along the coast between Pangani and Mombasa, from which small dhows could slip off at night and reach Pemba unnoticed. It is therefore clear that the slave trade remained a major activity well into the colonial period.\nThe European trade missions and the naval patrol against slave traders were limited to Zanzibar and the coastal areas. Although Europeans could no doubt obtain from Arab traders a few stories about places far away from the coast, the vast hinterland remained unknown to them. Gradually, however, events were to turn the attention of the humanitarians and the evangelicals to East Africa. Until 1856 their main interest was still focused on the trans-Atlantic trade. But as more became known about the horrors of the East African slave trade, European public attention was more and more drawn to the region."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Sudan in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Resistance to the imperial drive in the South, 1821-80', 'content': 'Futhermore, there were the European merchants who were demanding from the Turkish government that the Sudanese ivory markets be thrown open to free trade. When later the European traders were faced with lower profit margins, they decided to pay their Arab retainers in slaves rather than in cash, and this intensified the slave trade. Kaka in northern Shillukland soon emerged as a major slave market, especially for slaves coming from the southern zeribas. The boom at Kaka was partly connected with the abolition of the slave trade in the Turkish-controlled Sudan in 1854. It became the main slave market of the White Nile, and its immigrant population swelled rapidly. The activities of the freebooter, Muhammad al-Khäyr, a Dongalawi by birth, who moved to Kaka from Taqali in 1854, may also have facilitated the transformation of Kaka into a slave market. 25 It is estimated that by i860, an average of 2000 slaves were being sold annually at Kaka and, to acquire this number, Khâyr and his slave gangs were terrorizing the whole Shilluk countryside.$^{2}$^ The southerners refused to co-operate with the traders and actively resisted their presence in their land.

By the time Sayyid Said had transferred his economic interest to East Africa, the slave traffic to Mauritius had been reduced by British intervention and the island had even been taken over by them in 1810. But Seyyid Said encouraged the expansion of clove and coconut plantations in Zanzibar and Pemba. By the time he transferred his capital to Zanzibar in the 1840s, clove plantations were already the domi› nant economic activity and were mostly operated by slave labour. This created a class of landowners, originally mainly Arabs, but by the 1860s including indigenous Shirazi and Indians as well. By the 1860s it is estimated that the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba were absorbing about 10 000 slaves per annum. This was in addition to those supplied to other markets (largely Arab) abroad. It has been estimated that by the 1860s the Zanzibar market alone was handling as many as 70 000 slaves per annum and that the heaviest traffic started after 1840.$^{1}$ Although these figures may have been greatly exaggerated, they do indicate that the slave trade has increased tremendously by the middle of the nineteenth century.\nThe second commercial commodity exported from East Africa was ivory. In Chapter 9 we saw how its market was beginning to expand in the first decades of the nineteenth century due to increased demand in the industrialized West, apart from the traditional market in India. Previously Europe and the USA had obtained their ivory from West Africa. The demand for East African ivory, however, increased when it was discovered that it was of better quality (softer) and therefore more suitable for making luxury goods, such as combs, billiard balls and piano keys, which the richer classes were demanding. All British efforts to control this trade directly from East Africa failed because Indian merchants were already well entrenched in conducting the trade through Bombay from where it was re-exported to Europe.

The slaves were carried in caravans of several hundreds and transported to the Ethiopian coast for shipment at the ports of Berbera, Zeila, Tajura, Assab, Obock and Massawa, from where they were ferried across the Red Sea to the ports of Jeddah, Mocha, and Hoideida.

Kelly,$^{7}$ the slave trade from Zanzibar was virtually a monopoly of the Muscat Arabs and their rulers who derived their revenue mostly from the custom duties levied on the trade. In the early nineteenth century, Muscat was the greatest clearing house of the traffic to the Gulf, Persia, Irak and India, but as the century wore on its dominance was to be challenged by the port of Sur to the southward. The majority of the slaves landed at Muscat were sold within Oman itself. The rest were bought by agents from the Trucial Coast, notably the Kawâsim, for resale on the coast or in the markets of Persia, Irak, Bahrain, Kuwait, Hasa and Nadj. From Muscat and Sur, slaves were also conveyed to the ports of SindhTKutch, Kathiawar and the Bombay Presidency, in Bahraini, Kuwaiti and Indian bottoms. Those intended for the Persian market were landed at Bushire as well as brought across the Gulf to Lingah from Sharjah.

The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'The process of suppression', 'content': 'routes for the export and distribution of slaves.

But, in the nineteenth century, the accumulation of captives by certain privileged groups often coincided with the rapid growth ofa marketrelated sector of the economy rather than with economic expansion due to increased payments of tribute-money. We have seen the result in the role played by 'domestic slaves' in the demographic and agricultural expansion of some of the communities in the region, such as the Kongo, Ovimbundu, and Ovambo.\nIn Angolan colonial society, the slave trade was likewise linked to the capitalist market economy, and had grown to sizeable proportions by the second half of the nineteenth century. In spite of certain legal tech› nicalities - slavery was formally abolished in Angola in 1878 - a slave labour sector was certainly the basis of the boom in cotton, plantation coffee, and especially sugar-cane production.

Similarly, Nguni dynamism was premised upon their ability to incorporate and extract surplus from their large pool of captives. 51 Allowing for local variations, a broad pattern of economic dislocation resulting from the slave trade is nevertheless discernible. The violent disruption of much of the rural economy, the export of many of the most productive members of the indigenous societies, the inadvertent introduction of highly contagious diseases, and the growing dependence of the Central African economy on the world trading system intensified the process of underdevelopment. It is true that this process was accompanied by the dissemination of new crops such as tobacco, maize, rice and cassava, the introduction of modest technological innovations like the Chikunda traps, granaries, and weapons, and the expansion of some local industry. But these were relatively insignificant developments when placed in juxtaposition to the economic retardation of the region as a whole. 52 Little needs to be said about the unprecedented level of destruction that While slavery had been a feature of many Central African societies before the slave trade, preliminary evidence suggests a growing tendency to acquire captives to extract surplus which the aristocracy used to maintain its privileged position.

One nineteenth-century traveller recalled the effect of the Yao raids in the 1860s against the Manganja: A number of the Manganja went with them. Everywhere they saw sad signs of the war - villages burnt, gardens uncared for, the beautiful land about them rapidly becoming desert.

A switch meant changing old trade habits and methods, and dealing with a new set of white traders.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well.

Such termini were centres of active transactions.\nA system of this type was characterized by increasingly marked contrasts between areas that monopolized profitable operations - centralization of large quantities of products, handling and marketing operations - and those where there were fewer opportunities to accumulate wealth. The more fortunate regions had quite a different appearance from the others: arms, textiles and domestic slaves were plentiful there and rare elsewhere. As we shall see, during periods of economic recession the Portuguese tried to monopolize the profits of the network by eliminating African 'middlemen', whereas during periods of economic growth most of the trade in the interior was carried on by Africans.\nDuring the nineteenth century, the network had to adapt to certain major trade cycles. Up to the 1840s the slave trade was by far the most important Portuguese-African activity. This last peak period was in fact the most disastrous in the history of the Angolan slave trade. It is estimated that from 1780 to 1830, between 15000 and 20000 slaves were exported annually from Central African ports (from the Loango coast to the south of Angola). Brazil was the main importer and Angola the principal supplier. It was Angolan slave labour that made it possible to expand the coffee- plantation economy of Rio de Janeiro and Sào Paulo in the nineteenth century. On the whole, the Atlantic slave trade, even the clandestine operations, died out in the course of the 1850s, although in the lower Zaire river area it survived outside Portuguese control until the disappearance of the last of the slave markets in Latin America towards the end of the i86os.\nDuring the remainder of the century, exports from Angola were limited to a few agricultural products (such as coffee and sugar) and especially, products obtained by gathering - mostly wax and ivory - though during the last three decades of the century a greater variety of exported products were gathered, such as wild coffee, copal, palm oil and, later, more import¬ antly, natural rubber."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.697, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > Summary', 'content': ""In addition, the captives which these kingdoms needed as a form of currency with which to buy rare goods and the instruments of war were being carried off at a rate which was becoming less and less compatible with the survival of the societies concerned, especially when they were seized from peoples already subject to tribute, since that depleted the reserves of the dominant powers. Due to a by no means unusual time-lag, European decisions to abolish the slave trade did not prevent it from reaching a paroxysm in the course of the nineteenth century in a number of countries on the Niger Bend and in the upper basin of the various affluents of the Volta. Emancipation by the state and reintegration into lineage groups did little to reduce the destructive effects of this scourge, which was not to abate until the end of the nineteenth century. In fact, those countries whose economies had been kept going by the 'ports of the desert' at the end of the caravan routes were now enclosed and isolated, being separated from the coast by other states, at a time when basic trading patterns were collapsing. In such circumstances they were bound, slowly but inexorably, to fall into decline.\nIn these circumstances, as often happens in periods of crisis, social divisions were exacerbated, transforming the relatively egalitarian struc› tures that had been characteristic of the societies of the Sahel during their period of ascendancy. Another factor was the evolution of the religious movements which, after the tolerance towards traditional cults shown during the preceding centuries, had adopted a more intransigent attitude as a result of the djihad, which had triumphed in Liptako and had swept through the Bambara states. Even the YarsØ of the Mossi country, pre› viously so flexible in both religious and political affairs, began to take up much more rigid positions and engaged in proselytism.

The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda.

In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports.

Two of the most influential traders—viz., Biselli and Ali Amouri, seem to have been the great culprits. After stating the straits to which they were reduced, owing to the perfidious conduct of these slavetraders, Mr. Tinne says that one of the ladies in their letter goes on to state how negroes were beaten, and in some cases shot, for attempting to relieve them; that Ali Abu Amouri, when applied to for help, refused to give it except upon terms equally outrageous with those of Biselli, and also forbade his negroes to sell to or assist them in any way. Selim also, Ali\'s steward, robbed them in every way possible, and encouraged his men to do so too. Their people attempted to build huts to spend the rainy season in, but Biselli refused the help of his negroes, without which help they could not get materials. M. von Henglin, a well-known scientific traveller who accompanied the expedition, confirms this, and gives particulars of other very atrocious acts. He states that a soldier of his party had bought four elephants\' tusks from a native sheik; on learning which fact the people of the merchant Ali Abu Amouri attacked the negroes, took the sheik and several others prisoners, and killed the sheik\'s wife. The captured negroes would be sold as slaves. M. Kleinzinik, another traveller, had sent them about fifteen porters from a neighbouring station, Roulanda, with corn bought from the merchant Biselli, but having arrived near Biselli\'s zeriba, they were arrested by one of his dragomen, who forced the negroes with threats to return with their loads. They next attempted to buy corn from the tribes of the Niam-Niams; and a sheik was bringing them a good supply, when they were met by men of Ali Abu Amouri, who put both the negroes and Henglin\'s soldiers in irons, and took them to the zeriba of Ali, where the soldiers were at last released, but the negroes detained as slaves, and three of their number, who had escaped, were retaken and shot.

After the treaty, he at once repudiated his accounts with the Indian merchant, and as an experiment marched his slaves to the north, where he sold them at a large profit, returned by sea to Kilwa, and was able to take advantage of the immense rise in prices owing to the demand for labour in Pemba. As a result, the slave-trader who a year ago was heavily in debt and trammelled in every way, is now a capitalist, and able to pay cash for the goods required to equip his next large venture towards the Nyassa or the country at the back of the Upper Rufiji. He no longer asks for credit, and it is not the merchant\'s business to inquire whether his ready-money customer is engaged in the traffic. At Brava and Lamu slaves are in large demand, and Pemba is still unsatisfied; neither will Arabia and the Persian Gulf be contented to forego their usual supplies.

Having a work in hand, I at first recommended another for the task, but on his declining to go without a handsome salary and something to fall back on afterwards, I agreed to go myself, and was encouraged by Sir Roderick saying, in his warm, jovial manner, \'You will be the real discoverer of the sources of the Nile.\' I thought that two years would be sufficient to go from the coast inland across the head of Lake Nyassa to the watershed, wherever that might be, and after examination try to begin a benevolent mission with some tribe on the slope reach to the coast! Had I known all the time, toil, hunger, hardships, and worry involved in that precious water-parting, I might have preferred having my head shaved and a blister put on it to grappling with my good old friend\'s task. But having taken up the burden, I could not bear to be beaten by it. I shall tell you a little about the progress made by-and-bye. At present let me give you a glimpse of the slave trade, to which the search and discovery of most of the Nile fountains has brought me face to face. The whole traffic, whether on land or ocean, is a gross outrage of the common law of mankind. It is carried on from age to age; and, in addition to the untold evils it inflicts, it presents almost insurmountable obstacles to intercourse between the different portions of the human family. This open sore in the world is partly owing to human cupidity and partly to ignorance of the more civilised of mankind of the blight which lights chiefly on the more degraded. Piracy on the high seas was once as common as slave trading is now. But as it became thoroughly known the whole civilised world rose against it. In now trying to make the Eastern African slave trade better known to Americans, I indulge the hope that I am aiding on, though in a small degree, the good time coming yet, when slavery as well as piracy shall be chased from the world.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1872#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East and Central Africa Foreign Slave Trade', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In 1865, the period when M. Rohlfs crossed the Fezzan, many things were related to him respecting the local administration. He was witness at that time of the following scene:—On a certain day, the doctor of the garrison presented himself at the residence of M. Rohlfs, begging him to dismiss his servant, and to close the door; he then entered upon the subject of the slave trade, and, according to his statement, there was an understanding between the authorities and the slave traders. These latter only guide their convoys by night. As soon as the caravan arrives, the corporal of the watch begins to count heads; the Kobrassi presides at the opening of the city gates, and the Kaimakan receives a report; he, as governor, demands this, because his perquisite is the sum of two mahbouds (ten francs, or about eight shillings English money) per slave; this is regarded as a small gratuity for his son-in-law, Kaivasbacha. This contraband proceeding must be very profitable, if we are to believe the good doctor. The Kaimakan had allowed at least four thousand slaves to pass through the city of Mourzouk in 1865, but the number might have amounted to ten thousand when crossed the Oasis. This information was of the greatest importance; but it is sad to be obliged to say, that in giving it, the doctor acted not from a feeling of humanity, but merely from jealousy; in this work of lucrative deception, the Kaimakan had not given a single mahboud either to the Kobrassi or to the doctor.\n\nThis, then, is the manner in which the slave trade is continued in defiance of all laws. Though the law condemns it, public opinion sees in it only a national institution which it is not forced to give up; the authorities shut their eyes, or favour a commerce that assures to them handsome revenues. As for the supervision of European Powers, it has been as nothing for many years past. The consuls confine themselves to the principal ports on the coast, where the traffickers never come; the consular agents, in the interior, are not always wisely chosen, so that their surveillance is not efficient; both parties frequently fail with respect to the knowledge necessary to render it so.\n\nIt seems established by evidence that the traffic in slaves, far from decreasing, is more flourishing than ever. An old inhabitant of Kouka declares, that during the last twenty years a greater number had been sent from Bornou than had been, previously, for one hundred years.\n\nThe merchants, whom the police of Europe disturbed in some places, no doubt, concluded that their traffic would be less interfered with beyond the solitudes of Sahara.\n\n*(To be continued.)*', 'last_edit_date': '1872-10-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1872#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East and Central Africa Foreign Slave Trade', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The accusation is a solemn one.

In order to understand the abominations connected with the Eastern slave trade, we must rid ourselves of our European ideas, and enter a new world, in which men and events have in store for us more than one subject of surprise.\n\nIt is easy to form an opinion as to the importance of this slave traffic in this region, when we know the extent of the caravans that convey the negroes from Kouka. During many weeks, the preparations and the departure fill the capital with noise and bustle. Long files of camels are laden with provisions, two thousand armed men serve as an escort, and the human flock altogether counts four thousand heads.

His servants, who had drawn water from this spring, without observing it, carried off in the bucket the skull of a man. These human skeletons, mingled as they are with the bones of the lower animals, are the remains of slaves.\n\nOn leaving these frightful solitudes, where man is proved to be more merciless than the desert, reaching the zone of the forests, the eye is rejoiced at the sight of rich vegetation, flowers and lakes, these latter giving to the soil an endless source of fertility.\n\nBut in the midst of Nature, which God has made so rich, sorrowful reflections come over the mind. This privileged land is the theatre of slavery, and the home of the man-hunter. The large city of Kouka, in the vicinity of Lake Tchad, the capital of Bornou, is one of the greatest marts for this human merchandise.\n\nOn the Square, the best adapted for the slave-markets, one is sure every day to find several hundreds; but on Monday, the great sale day, they may be numbered by thousands; the blacks are there exhibited in their pitiable plight, partially covered with miserable tatters. The wholesale merchants and connoisseurs have no need to be attracted by a more delicate exposition, such as that which one would meet with in a retail purchase.\n\nThe slave is examined with care, taking measure of his height, opening his mouth, counting his teeth, asking questions about his appetite, &c., &c. The price demanded is according to his age, strength and colour of the prisoner, and varies from half a sovereign to five pounds for the current merchandise. Is this all that a man is worth, and is this the estimate put on human liberty? There are other markets at which the slave is considered of still less value.\n\nBut whence come all these wretched beings? It is here that the Eastern traffic is presented to us under a particular aspect, such as it did not assume on the western coasts of Africa in the organised commerce of slaves. Man-hunting, which supplies the victims for these markets, is not only encouraged by the brutal ferocity of the chief of a tribe; it is considered an act commanded by religion.\n\nThe Sultan, who goes to make razzias at the head of warriors, with whom he divides the booty, by an impious aberration believes that he performs a pious work in spreading devastation around him.

In the new traffic, organised for the markets of the East, the black that has just been severed from his family and deprived of his liberty, while suffering unheard-of cruelties, must traverse the vast plains of sand which separate the interior of Africa from the borders of the Mediterranean, in order to arrive at the place of his future servile existence.\n\nThe desert, with its scorching sands, devoid of verdure and springs, with its storm-driven dust that buries caravans, seems more terrible than the ocean, and to cross it requires a more lengthened period.\n\nFrom the town of Tripoli to the Lake Tchad, there are nearly twenty degrees—an extent of land more than twice and a half the length of Great Britain. It is by this route that the convoys of negroes are driven by their pitiless masters, condemned, under the burning sun, to the tortures of thirst, hunger and fatigue. It is a long funeral march in the midst of the solitude of the desert.\n\nFrom time to time one of the miserable company falls, to rise no more; his fellow-prisoners make no halt to cover his body even with a little sand. Let it not be supposed that this is a picture of the imagination only. Monsieur Rohlfs, who was an eyewitness of these things during his explorings between the years 1865 and 1867, and who was the first to denounce these mysteries of crime, gives them to us in frightful detail:—\n\n""On both sides of the road,"" he says, ""we see the blanched bones of the victimised slaves—skeletons still covered by the haikoun, the clothing of the blacks. The traveller who knows nothing of the road to Bourno, has only to follow these scattered remains, and he will not be misguided.""\n\nThe merchants take a singular precaution, lest the slave should rob them of a few drops of water: they place the leathern bottle in such a position, that the orifice is turned towards the head of the camel that carries it. The animal, which is itself athirst, begins to cry as soon as the precious vessel is touched, and thus the attempt to partake of its contents would be discovered. Thus thirst, as well as bodily fatigue, has innumerable victims.\n\n* ""The Slave Trade in Africa in 1872. Principally carried on for the supply of Turkey, Egypt, Persia, and Zanzibar.""

The former is a valuable oil, and would be a new article of commerce, only a few tons having as yet been imported, while the cotton would be from an entirely new source of supply.

They are now seldom brought in large companies to Cairo, but they are brought so from the Soodan and Osiout and other places up the river. From these points, from one to five at a time are brought to Cairo on grain boats and other vessels. If any questions are asked, the captains, with a little backsheesh to confirm their story, can easily pass so small a number of supernumeraries as wives, children, servants, or sailors. From Boolak, the port of Cairo, these slaves are retailed, as there may be opportunity, to persons who want their services. If the vessel must move before such opportunity occurs, they are sold to a dealer, who buys cheaper than the retail purchasers. My friend told me that he had a number of black slaves, but said he had allowed them to marry, and had given them free papers, that their service with him was voluntary, and in the event of his death they would be safe from the claims of heirs and creditors. It is common for Egyptians, who know that almost all Christendom opposes the institution, to make such apologies to frank acquaintances, but in this case I believe the statement was correct.\n\n""This conversation increased my curiosity and strengthened my determination to see the Cairo slave-pen if possible.

This was because the cost of weapons increased steadily, so that pro› gressively greater numbers of slaves had to be offered in exchange. It is not surprising, then, to find entire groups, such as the Zamberma, spe› cializing in the extraction of this 'black ore'. The main sources of supply, however, were not only the great djihäd conducted by the Muslim leaders of the north and the conflicts in Mossi territory. The trade was also fed from a host of channels that sluiced off slaves from peoples belonging to hundreds of chieftaincies, from the territories of the Tuareg to the areas bordering the trading posts on the coast. During the final decades of the nineteenth century, war broke out in virtually every decade and in virtually every region, and war meant captives. These victims were for the most part from sedentary agricultural communities, which served as a veritable breeding stock for the trade. Hence the underpopulated areas to be found in regions that were literally drained of their inhabitants. Tribute exacted in the form of captives was extremely heavy in many instances. When indigenous peoples took action to organize their own defence, they were frequently used as mercenaries in wars elsewhere, as in the case of some of the Gurunsi who fought in the ranks of the Zamberma, and the Samo (Sanan) who took part in the dynastic wars of Yatenga."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The new changes resulted from a combination of factors, including the nineteenth-century wars which, as in Yorubaland, had the effect of ren› dering the coastal areas relatively safe and attractive to migration from the hinterlands in which most of the fighting took place; the sea-borne trade which was rendered permanent by the transition from slave to 'legitimate' trade, thereby conferring a definite economic advantage on the coastal regions; and the steady growth of European interest, which enlarged the traditional role of selected coastal towns such as Lagos, Porto Novo and eventually Cotonou to take on new and increasing responsibilities not only as ports but also as political capitals of emergent colonial states and their independent African successors.\nIn all these changes, however, the economic factor would appear to have been the most dominant, especially with reference to the European presence. Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty.

In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade.

Similarly, Nguni dynamism was premised upon their ability to incorporate and extract surplus from their large pool of captives. 51 Allowing for local variations, a broad pattern of economic dislocation resulting from the slave trade is nevertheless discernible. The violent disruption of much of the rural economy, the export of many of the most productive members of the indigenous societies, the inadvertent introduction of highly contagious diseases, and the growing dependence of the Central African economy on the world trading system intensified the process of underdevelopment. It is true that this process was accompanied by the dissemination of new crops such as tobacco, maize, rice and cassava, the introduction of modest technological innovations like the Chikunda traps, granaries, and weapons, and the expansion of some local industry. But these were relatively insignificant developments when placed in juxtaposition to the economic retardation of the region as a whole. 52 Little needs to be said about the unprecedented level of destruction that While slavery had been a feature of many Central African societies before the slave trade, preliminary evidence suggests a growing tendency to acquire captives to extract surplus which the aristocracy used to maintain its privileged position.

The legal basis for forced labour which was to continue under varying guises until 1961, was delineated in Article 1: All native inhabitants of the Portuguese overseas are subject to the moral and legal obligations to seek to acquire through work, those things which they lack to subsist and to improve their own social conditions. They have full liberty to choose the means through which to comply with this obligation, but if they do not comply in some way, the public authorities may force them to comply. 65 And force them they did. Local administrators had complete discretion to determine who was 'idle', and virtually all chefes des posto supplemented their modest salaries through gifts and favours from European planters, merchants, factory owners and farmers in return for African labour. As a result, the rural areas were transformed into large labour reserves. When workers were needed to work on settler estates, to build roads, expand the ports of Luanda, Lourenço Marques and Beira, lay railway lines, serve as domestic servants or for any other private or public tasks, local administrators did not hesitate to use their control and their power to satisfy labour demands.

The Makua aristocracy pursued such a self-destructive strategy. Until the 1850s the Makua had been the principal exporters of slaves to Mozambique Island. One by-product of their predatory activities was a large-scale migration of the victimized societies. Faced with a diminished labour pool the Makua rulers began raiding each other and enslaving their own subjects in order to maintain the profitable slave trade on which they had become totally dependent.

In reaction to these excesses the indigenous population either revolted and drove the prazeros off the land or fled into the interior, depriving the estate owner of his traditional source of tribute. The effect, in either case, was the destruction of most prazos by 1830, and those that managed to survive suffered from recurring famines that so debilitated the indigenous population that they proved no match for the attacks of the subsequent decades.

The Yao penetrated into the Lake Nyasa region during the first half of the century and, after 1850, entered the Shire valley in search of new markets among the Manganja and Chewa. Simultaneously, they established commercial ties to the Indian Ocean port of Ibo, which became a major export centre. The Chikunda, initially in the service of Afro-Portuguese and Afro-Goan prazeros, extended their commercial contacts from the area immediately north of the Zambezi to the Luangwa valley and south into what is now Zimbabwe, while the Bisa intensified their operations in the territory between the Shire and Luapula valleys.

When we first read that letter our spirit was mightily stirred within us, and we wrote immediately such a leader for our October number as the grossness of the evil seemed imperatively to demand from us. That leader, with most of the new and important matter intended for our October number, miscarried in the post—a mishap that was not known until there was then no longer time for remedy. But there is time now for us to expose and attack this abomination. The accursed thing is there, like to the forbidden spoil secreted in the tents of Achan; and there is no possibility of good for or in Lagos until it be brought forth and destroyed. Out with it, out of the tent, or hut, or house, and bring it to public light. Can it be any longer a matter of wonder that we should have had to lament that Lagos has done hitherto so much less than we had fondly hoped and believed it would do in the spread of civilization and Christianity around it, seeing that it is in itself so deeply polluted? If the source be bitter, the waters flowing from it cannot be sweet. The source must be purified.

Shame, shame, ten thousand times shame, that it is not now the greedy foreign pirates who are stimulating the equally horrid greed of the debased heathen Africans of the interior to obtain by war and kidnapping, with their attendant murders, burnings, and desolations, the hundreds and thousands of their wretched fellow-countrymen and countrywomen that were wanted to cram the fetid hold of the slave-ship! It is now people calling themselves civilized Africans, educated Africans, men and women who have been taught in missionary schools, men and women who are possibly attending divine service in churches and chapels, that are violating the most precious precepts of Him on whom they profess to believe for salvation.

Writing of the oppressed and devastated districts of Ijesha the writer, under the signature of ""Okanlogue,"" states that the barbarous oppressors ""look upon the remnant of the people in the country as their fortune, for there is not an Ejirin or Ikorodu market in which the sons and daughters of the soil are not to be found as one of the articles for speculation; besides which, many of them are daily purchased by the cruel King of Dahomey, to be offered in sacrifice at his Customs."" It may be that on reading this extract some of the despicable offenders who are renewing the slave-trade at Lagos, violating the public law as well as the precepts of the religion they profess, will say, Is it not better that we should purchase these people than that they should be sold to Dahomey? No; it is not better. Their motive in buying these victims has not been to save them from the tender mercies of Dahomey, but one of lust or greed. There is not even a shadow of good in the thing; it is hideous and abominable in its every aspect—filthy and loathsome throughout. Away with it; it must and will poison everything around it. There are good men and women in Lagos,—what have they been about to allow this abomination to exist among them? There are British authorities in Lagos, and British laws are in force there,—what have those authorities been about not to enforce those laws? Lagos is not so large a place that those slave-trade practices could be carried on in a corner unknown of by the innocent portion of the community. The sole object in view by the British Government when it annexed Lagos was to extirpate the slave-trade and slavery therein and within the sphere of its influence. The foreign slave-trade is now, thanks be to God, quite a thing of the past in West Africa. There are not any slave-ships now carrying cargoes of human victims to over-sea countries. It cannot be permitted that a new traffic in slaves should be established in Lagos (for those who buy will sell also when lust is satisfied, or money may be made by it) soiling and dishonouring anew the British flag, in defiance of British law and the feelings of the British Government and people, who have done all they could to wipe out the iniquity of their forefathers, who permitted and took part in the loathsome foreign slave-trade. We call upon the British authorities in Lagos to set to work at once and put an end, root and branch, to the slave-trade and slave-holding iniquity that ""Otitor Koro"" has brought under our notice, and which cannot now be any further ignored or winked at. There surely cannot be an ineradicable sympathy with these practices in Lagos; but we must say it seems strange that it should have been found necessary to invoke our aid against them. Be this as it may, our duty was clear. Not only do we denounce it in our columns—not only do we cry shame upon the perpetrators of the evil, and demand immediate action against it on the part of the responsible British authorities in Lagos, but we have brought the hated matter directly under the notice of the Earl of Carnarvon, who will, we are well assured, not lose any time in expressing his disapprobation as regards the official remissness which has rendered it possible for him to be thus appealed to; and his expectation that although the new stain cannot be removed, the pollution will, at least, be effectually destroyed.'}, {'id': 3293, 'article_title': 'The New Route to Abomey, the Capital of Dahomey', 'full_section_title': 'The New Route to Abomey, the Capital of Dahomey', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1877#article-19', 'issue_date': '01_01_1877', 'content': '### TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.\n\nLagos, November 16, 1876.\n\nSir,—I am moved by patriotic feeling to support the true and godly statements in the columns of the October number of your journal by one Mr. ""Otitor Koro""—viz., ""The extensive Slave-trade Practi.es in Lagos.""

The slaves were marched up to the Government House; the Governor having consulted his courtiers and adviser, ordered their names to be recorded, and _delivered them back to their respective owners._ Not a word of warning was said to these owners for buying slaves privately. Considering this place to be a thorough British settlement, I was perfectly astounded at this impolitic act of his. This cruel practice had been long carried on in this settlement. Traders and merchants are in the habit of receiving slaves as payment from their debtors, and have them privately shipped to Porto Novo and Oke Odon for sale. Would you not, as a father to us poor Africans, see that the Home Government check this ungodly practice and also wake our authorities from their deadly sleep?\n\nDear Sir, what you can do in this case everybody knows; and the slave-dealers themselves are, so to say, on the tenter-hooks of impatience to know what the ""Iway Illu Obba"" (the English book—i.e., the newspaper of England, the _African Times_) will say about this decision. But they are also disgracefully aware that during the interval they are safe to import, export, and do what they like with their slaves, in doing which, my blood curdles in my veins to say, they are warranted by the unheard-of-in-the-annals-of-this-place indecision, and the un-English inhumanity of the _ipse dixit_ novices in the Ward-of-Admiralty-_pro-slavery_-Government House.'}, {'id': 3356, 'article_title': 'Slavery and Slave-trade in Lagos', 'full_section_title': 'Slavery and Slave-trade in Lagos', 'last_edit_date': '06-10-1877', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1877#article-9', 'issue_date': '01_08_1877', 'content': 'Sir,—I want to see slavery abolished all over the world.

Since then, further details have come to hand, and we learn that this Adeoshun has for some time been regarded as a ""Ju Ju medicine man,"" and had acquired great influence over the females of Lagos, owing to his dealings in ""charms"" and ""fetish."" When the last advices left Lagos, Adeoshun was undergoing a police examination, and so great was the excitement in the place, and particularly among the female portion of the inhabitants, that a force of Houssas had to be specially in attendance at the police-court to protect the accused from the violence of the mob, which numbered some 3,000 people. The first charge against Adeoshun is that of the murder of Mrs. Selina Cole. This lady disappeared very mysteriously some time since, and it was thought that she had been decoyed outside the protectorate and sold into slavery—a circumstance which is stated in the despatch to be not of very unfrequent occurrence. Subsequently the husband of the missing woman became aware that certain property which belonged to his wife was in the possession of Adeoshun. A search warrant being obtained, goods to the value of some £160 were found on the premises of the accused, all of which were said to belong to Mrs. Cole. The matter having been taken up by Inspector Willoughby, of the Houssa police, a bush near the town was searched, resulting in the discovery of four skeletons, and subsequently eight more. The remains of Mrs. Cole were among the number. It is said that the accused, by the aid of his charms, was believed by the females of the colony to be able to bring them wealth. From Mrs. Cole alone we learn that Adeoshun obtained some £500 prior to her disappearance. It is stated that the prisoner induced his victims to meet him in a lonely part of Ikoyi (near where the bodies were found) and there forced them to kneel down with their eyes blindfolded. A live fowl was then put in each hand of the victims, and while in this position it is believed they were despatched by the aid of some heavy weapon.

The very first motion of the Lagos Executive, stimulated by the letters and leaders in the African Times, gave such ample confirmatory evidence of the truth of our statements, that the fact of a gross, systematic, and extensive violation of the British laws against slave-trading was placed beyond dispute. Owing, perhaps, to the consciousness that there had been a long and culpable neglect on their part, the early action of the Executive in the matter, after obtaining the above-mentioned evidence, was limited to official public warnings that all future infractions of the law would be severely dealt with. The public warnings were so given that it was not possible for any of the inhabitants of Lagos to be ignorant of them. Nevertheless, it soon became our painful duty to record that the abominable slave-trade practices had not ceased. This was intolerable; and we are now glad to make known the fact that the law has been vindicated by the conviction and punishment of some of the offenders. It will be seen in our Lagos letter that five of these slave-traders—all natives of Lagos and its vicinity—have been convicted and sentenced by Mr. Justice Woodcock, each to seven years of penal servitude. We can have no pleasure in the humiliation and sufferings of any one, even of slave-traders—we had rather see the laws obeyed, than see people punished for infraction of them; but it was quite evident that only severe measures would put a stop to the iniquitous and, we suppose, profitable traffic, by greedy men, in the lives and liberties of their fellow-creatures. The richly-deserved punishment has overtaken some of them; and we can only express the hope that this salutary example may have so deterrent an effect as to put an end altogether to what has been a great disgrace to Lagos, and prevent the necessity of inflicting further punishments.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

The slave trade was of course a product of, and a key element in, the construction of the European-centred capitalist world-economy that had come into existence c. 1450. By the seventeenth century this capitalist world-economy included as part of its peripheral production areas the 'extended' Caribbean zone of the Americas. In this zone, the expanding plantation systems (especially sugar, but also tobacco, cotton, and other products) came to depend increasingly for their manpower on slaves who were 'captured' in West and Central Africa and transported across the Atlantic.\nShould this long-distance trade in slaves be classified as 'luxury' trade or as trade in 'essentials'? Can it be said to have involved the 'production' of manpower for the capitalist world-economy? And should therefore the 'producing' zones be seen as peripheral areas of this capitalist worldeconomy? There is no simple answer to these queries. In terms of numbers exported there was an upward curve in the slave trade from 1450 to 1800, with a significant increase c. 1650.

Kaka in northern Shillukland soon emerged as a major slave market, especially for slaves coming from the southern zeribas. The boom at Kaka was partly connected with the abolition of the slave trade in the Turkish-controlled Sudan in 1854. It became the main slave market of the White Nile, and its immigrant population swelled rapidly. The activities of the freebooter, Muhammad al-Khäyr, a Dongalawi by birth, who moved to Kaka from Taqali in 1854, may also have facilitated the transformation of Kaka into a slave market. 25 It is estimated that by i860, an average of 2000 slaves were being sold annually at Kaka and, to acquire this number, Khâyr and his slave gangs were terrorizing the whole Shilluk countryside.$^{2}$^ The southerners refused to co-operate with the traders and actively resisted their presence in their land.

By the time he transferred his capital to Zanzibar in the 1840s, clove plantations were already the domi› nant economic activity and were mostly operated by slave labour. This created a class of landowners, originally mainly Arabs, but by the 1860s including indigenous Shirazi and Indians as well.

In Chapter 9 we saw how its market was beginning to expand in the first decades of the nineteenth century due to increased demand in the industrialized West, apart from the traditional market in India. Previously Europe and the USA had obtained their ivory from West Africa. The demand for East African ivory, however, increased when it was discovered that it was of better quality (softer) and therefore more suitable for making luxury goods, such as combs, billiard balls and piano keys, which the richer classes were demanding. All British efforts to control this trade directly from East Africa failed because Indian merchants were already well entrenched in conducting the trade through Bombay from where it was re-exported to Europe.

This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

This was because the cost of weapons increased steadily, so that pro› gressively greater numbers of slaves had to be offered in exchange.

The main sources of supply, however, were not only the great djihäd conducted by the Muslim leaders of the north and the conflicts in Mossi territory. The trade was also fed from a host of channels that sluiced off slaves from peoples belonging to hundreds of chieftaincies, from the territories of the Tuareg to the areas bordering the trading posts on the coast.

Humanitarianism is a Western ideology, and it is unlikely to have found any place in the minds of African distributors of the time - with very rare exceptions. But this does not mean that they were constitutionally incapable of giving up the trade, as Western supporters of slavery maintained. The continuance of the supply of exportable manpower from Africa can be logically explained in economic terms. That the distributors were black and the exporters white is irrelevant: it was a paying proposition, profitable to both trading partners, whose sole object was to make money. That was the situation at the grass roots. The continuance of the supply is to be explained in terms of the efficient working of an integrated system: and what Africans were resisting was the disruption of this system. For one thing, it would have ruined the established business of the distributors,$^{31}$ who had no other prospects, to say nothing of the chain of repercussions it would have set off on the social and political structure, both locally and further afield. In other words, so long as the barter system between the hinterland and the coast, and the coast's foreign trade, had no clear alternative to the slave trade, opposition by African slave-traders to its suppression was dictated strictly by the imperative needs to avoid commercial chaos.$^{32}$ The supposed complicity of the African distributors was no more than a reflex reaction to the immediate economic situation. This also explains the fall in the selling price of exportable manpower: it was the market's defence against growing pressure from the forces of suppression. The latter thus helped to contribute to an unsatisfactory situation. This argument needs to be modi› fied when the exportation of Africans to the north or east is considered.

This developed new productive capacities that made slave labour less profitable and therefore produced new attitudes towards the slave trade. The so-called humanitarian spirit had already successfully persuaded Western countries to abolish the Atlantic slave trade and by the 1840s attention had been directed to the East African slave trade. Likewise, the evangelical movement associated with the humanitarian forces was, by the mid-nineteenth century, turning towards East Africa, partly because geographical exploration (itself a product of this new spirit of scientific curiosity and evangelism) was revealing challenging oppor› tunities for action against the evils of the Arab slave trade through mission› ary work and through the establishment of 'legitimate commerce'.\nThe words 'legitimate commerce' were used to refer to trade in com› modities other than human beings.

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.\nThis flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours. This route also linked Yorubaland with Borgu, Hausaland, Borno and beyond. The Christian missionary journeys across the wide expanse of Yorubaland from north to south and east to west and between Yorubaland and Dahomey were made possible because the necess› ary interconnecting routes already existed.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.606, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'New economic trends', 'content': 'In the economic as in the other fields, some new trends became discernible during our period. The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.617, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'The process of suppression', 'content': 'routes for the export and distribution of slaves.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well.

Indeed, Africans had been present in Western Europe from Classical Antiquity onwards, though the numbers only became substantial from about the fifteenth century on, when black Africans, first as slaves and then as freedmen, began to appear in southern Spain and Portugal, arriving at first by way of the trans-Saharan trade to North Africa. Then, as the direct maritime trade from Europe began to open in the second half of the century, still larger numbers of Africans appeared in Europe. 30 Many were slaves at first, especially in Portugal, the only significant slave-trading European power till nearly the middle of the seventeenth century. Over time, however, many found their way into the broader European society, though often at the bottom of the social hierarchy, since their social condition was assimilated to that of their fellow Africans who did most of the physical labour in the tropical colonies. Their legal status was also ambiguous. The law, in northern Europe generally, no longer recognized the status of slave, though European colonial laws did. From 1685, residence in France was held to confer freedom, and the same was true of England after the notable judicial decision of Lord Mansfield in 1772 already noted. In both situations, however, slaves from the colonies were still slaves de facto; in many instances until the European powers abolished slavery in the colonies themselves, in 1834 for Britain, 1848 for France, and 1888 for Brazil.\nIn spite of their ambiguous legal status, free Africans were present in Western Europe in considerable numbers from at least the mid-eighteenth century on. Estimates vary, but by 1800 they would have numbered several thousand in each of Spain, Portugal, France, or Britain; and in Spain or Portugal they would have been more numerous in an earlier period. The numbers were small in any case, compared with total European populations, but the African immigrants tended to be concentrated in the main cities, particularly in the port towns, so that their presence was more visible than their numbers would suggest.$^{31}$ It goes without saying that, for any period before the 1840s, far more people of tropical African descent would have been found in Europe than Europeans in tropical Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.634, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Social and economic transformation', 'content': 'With the effective end of the Atlantic slave trade and the increased demand for gold, palm oil, palm kernels and peanuts from western Africa, sugar cane from Mauritius, RØunion and the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean, as well as ivory and cloves from East and Central Africa, there was an increased demand for captives not only to produce these goods, but also to transport them by headload or by canoes down to the coast. Plantation slavery emerged, either in the form of slave settlements in the rural areas managed according to customary law on the Guinea coast, or Islamic law in the Muslim areas, or approximating to American-type plantations in the Indian Ocean islands. With the increased use of people of slave origin as warriors and in administrative positions at various courts, it has been estimated that in many parts of Africa slave populations could range between 25 and 50 per cent of the total population.$^{19}$ Although there were examples of slave revolts, and the particular example of the Lozi who threw off their Kololo overlords,$^{20}$ generally the slave populations did not form a distinct class. The bulk performed menial jobs, largely as agricultural labourers. However the substantial groups of warriors and domestic slaves, and the significant few who rose to positions of trust and power as successful warriors, traders or administrators, and the variations in their fortunes and life styles, made combination as a class of slaves very difficult. Only in places like Old Calabar, where the slaves were permanently alienated, with little inclination to integrate them culturally, and with a tradition of competition among the ruling elite to show off wealth by the number of slaves killed in funeral ceremonies,$^{21}$ did the slaves in the agricultural villages combine in a secret cult to demand improved conditions. Elsewhere, the prevalent ethos was acculturation and integration into the society through individual households. While the degree of integration was clearly limited - as witnessed by the number anxious to be redeemed or, having been emancipated by colonial laws, who were anxious to return to their original homes - it was real enough to suggest that the dynamics of change in most of the African communities was the tension of age and sex within each household, and of status and competition for power between the lineages and kinship groups, rather than between broad classes in society.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.612, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The diaspora in Europe', 'content': 'This community of Africans in Europe was also concentrated in certain occupations, especially domestic service, this being partly a carry-over from the occupational status of Africans who came by way of West Indian slavery, partly a reflection of the European fad for exotic servants. African sailors were also common by this time in the merchant service, though more so in Portugal than in France or Britain. Another significant, if smaller, group was made up of students, who began to arrive in Europe in significant numbers by the middle of the eighteenth century and, in increasing numbers, throughout the nineteenth century. In an era in which commercial contact between Europe and Africa was increasing, it was an obvious advantage to African traders to be literate in a Western language and to have some acquaintance with European accounting practices. Many of these students therefore came to Europe through the good offices of European slave-traders operating in Africa and studied under their care in the principal slave-trade ports like Liverpool or Nantes.\nStill another peculiarity of the African communities in Europe was the fact that they were overwhelmingly male. This fact had two important implications. The African community was not self-sustaining. It had to be, and was, constantly replenished from overseas. This is not to say that the Africans had no sexual relations with European women, but the products of these relationships tended to be culturally European rather than African. After a few generations, the African physical appearance tended to disappear into the general European genetic pool.\nSome Africans also found their way into Eastern Europe, in spite of a more attenuated maritime contact with tropical Africa itself. There, the main line of entry was by way of the Ottoman slave trade, which was not mainly a trade in North Africans, but included sub-Saharan Africans drawn across the Sahara to Ottoman-associated ports like Tripoli, or brought north down the Nile from what is now the southern Sudan.$^{32}$ In a few instances, small pockets of African culture persisted in parts of the Ottoman empire into the twentieth century, such as a small Hausa-speaking com› munity in what is now Yugoslavia.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.608, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Marketing', 'content': ""Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

Lord Stanley says we might have been under this delusion thirty years ago, but that we are wiser now, and not to be so gulled. The slave-trade was not created by England, or by any Europeans, he says; England found and used it, and no doubt aggravated the evil; but sixty years have passed since we made any money in that way, and therefore, whatever debt was owing to the people of Africa on this score, had certainly been by this time paid off."" The statute of limitations, we presume—a creditable plea, no doubt, for a so-called Christian people! But Lord Stanley had not studied his facts. We did not _find_ in Africa that _foreign slave-trade_ which has wrought such incalculable evil in Africa. We found domestic slavery and abominations innumerable, but no foreign slave-trade. When European ships first went down the West Coast in search of slaves, they found it.\n\ndifficult to obtain any. There were none offering for sale. The shipmasters were obliged to have recourse to kidnapping—pan-yaring those who came off to their ships to trade in produce. But the Europeans got possession of points on the Coast—they built forts—they tempted with articles and goods that were greedily sought after. Slaves, slaves, slaves, was their great demand. We have no space here to trace the progress and tell the horrors of the new foreign slave-trade thus inaugurated. But, as has been already stated, we and other Europeans reduced the population of those very Gold Coast territories, now so Pharisaically complained of, from five millions to about two hundred thousand, having ourselves shipped from thence—only from that Gold Coast to one—a single one of our West India islands, Jamaica, above 950,000 slaves within a period of one hundred and ten years, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; while millions were shipped during the same period from other parts of the doomed coast to other colonies. And this, Lord Stanley says, has been amply atoned for, if there really was anything to be atoned for, by a sixty-years\' discontinuance of the infamous practice! For all efforts on our part to suppress the slave-trade, Lord Stanley treats as a work of supererogation. It has been, he says, a waste of money and of valuable lives, some one of which latter was more valuable than the whole existence of our African colonies.

But they all agreed that slavery and the slave trade were contrary to the laws of natural and revealed religion, and hateful in the sight of that God who watched over all of us. They had been summoned there that afternoon to hear what the Cardinal had to tell them with regard to slavery in Africa. He did not believe that his Eminence would inculcate upon them the abstract iniquity of slavery and the slave trade, for in that case he would be preaching to converts. It was true that some time ago we, by the introduction of European energy, by opening the lucrative and large markets, gave a stimulus to the slave trade which had existed for time immemorial in Africa; but, during a hundred years, we had done something to wipe off the reproach. He thought that his Eminence would speak to them of the increase of the slave trade in the centre and the East of Africa, confirming the information which we had received from our explorers, our missionaries, and from Her Majesty's Consuls. He thought and hoped he (the Cardinal) would give them his views as to the best means of combating this evil. They would agree with him in thinking that it would be absurd for Englishmen, who had got possession of the most favoured spots in the uncivilized world, that we should be jealous of any other European nation desiring to increase their opportunities of promoting civilization. Belgium, France, Germany had lately been pursuing that policy, and as a consequence we were in possession of greater rights and of greater responsibilities, and the nations he had just mentioned would feel with us the weight of that responsibility. In 1815, at the Congress at Vienna, there was a strong condemnation of the slave trade. In 1822, at a Conference at Verona, the Duke of Wellington endeavoured to have the slave trade declared piracy. At the Congress of Berlin our Plenipotentiaries found it impossible to bring forward the question at all.

Alas! they have previously formed part of one of those caravans of slaves which traverse the Great Desert, from Bornou, in Central Africa, to Tripoli, the whole route of which through that Desert is clearly marked by the bleached bones of innumerable human victims of that accursed trade, carried on in Central as in Eastern Africa by Mahomedans for the supply of Mahometan countries.

They say in explanation of the expedition that the armed men are appointed to hunt elephants, and to protect the enterprise against the attacks of the enterprising trader. These latter, not contented with the exchange of their small articles of merchandise for ivory, desire to obtain the monopoly of so lucrative a commerce for themselves. Indeed, every year large cargoes of ivory are sent to Khartoum. Slaves have not appeared there since Turkey prohibited the importation of the negroes fifteen years ago. Secret correspondents come to conduct them beyond the city by the desert to their destination, of which, of course, they know nothing. It is by these means, that the enormities of the slave trade have been concealed, as with an impenetrable veil.\n\nThe following circumstance, however, furnishes some important information on the subject:—\n\nThe death of a Frenchman was one day announced, who had been at the head of a considerable establishment, and was everywhere known as a merchant in horses, and in elephants' teeth; he wished in life to be regarded as a gentleman.\n\nHe had, by dint of labour, reached the high position of his ancestors; but what did his books, which had been kept with scrupulous exactness, disclose?\n\nHe had traded not only in ivory and horses, but in slaves. The supplies, the mysterious correspondence, the number of livery servants, all were there indicated with a precision very unfortunate for the reputation of the deceased.

In order to understand the abominations connected with the Eastern slave trade, we must rid ourselves of our European ideas, and enter a new world, in which men and events have in store for us more than one subject of surprise.\n\nIt is easy to form an opinion as to the importance of this slave traffic in this region, when we know the extent of the caravans that convey the negroes from Kouka. During many weeks, the preparations and the departure fill the capital with noise and bustle. Long files of camels are laden with provisions, two thousand armed men serve as an escort, and the human flock altogether counts four thousand heads. For the Sultan, for his horsemen, for his wholesale merchants, for the entire city, the caravan season is a great annual festivity; for the slave, it is the moment of banishment, the renewal of sufferings, and perhaps the eve of his death.

L. Cameron, R.N., C.B. The Earl of Dundonald was in the chair.\n\nCommander Lovett Cameron, in the course of his opening remarks, said the slave trade went on all round the continent of Africa, and commerce had gone on with it. Our trade with the West Coast of Africa had gone on since the time of the Tudors. For centuries that trade was in slaves, and its increase was slow; but after several blows had been struck at that trade—among others by the liberation of slaves in the West Indian Islands, in America, and in Cuba—instead of their being any injury done to our commerce, our trade with the West Coast of Africa increased by leaps and bounds. It was only in 1850 or shortly after that we attacked a great nest of slave dealers in Lagos, and in 1861 it was made a British colony. Up to that time there had been no trade there except in slaves; but last year the trade of Lagos amounted to £357,831 imports, and £538,980 exports. And yet only thirty-eight years ago that place was of absolutely no value to us for legitimate commerce. On the Gold Coast slavery had been practically abolished by the British Government, but yet there was a good deal still existing owing to the native customs of the people. Even if the export of slaves from Africa was prevented entirely, the internal trade in them would still be enormous.\n\nFormerly the slave trade was subsidiary to the ivory trade, but when porters were no longer wanted for the latter, the former remained, only the men were killed and the women and children carried away. It had been said that domestic slavery must be allowed, and that was a very difficult question to settle. In his opinion, we should, as in India, abolish the legal status of slavery, but should not rout out all the households where no complaint was made. As long as domestic slavery existed there would be a market for slaves. We must have nothing to do with slavery; while the slave trade continued it was impossible for legitimate commerce to go on as it should! If the slave trade were done away with, they would find that all other trade would flourish.\n\nIn answer to questions Commander Lovett Cameron said he had avoided speaking of the Germans for diplomatic reasons.\n\nHe had a plan for the total abolition of slavery in Africa, which he hoped to explain shortly. It was, in brief, to establish a barricade across the country by the way of the lakes, and to get authority to maintain order on that line.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, on February 26, presided over a large meeting, held in Exeter Hall, when two African explorers, Commander Cameron and Captain Hore, were announced to speak.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-03-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_03_1889#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.607, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Extensive Slave Trade Practices in Lagos', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Having waited with much impatience in the hope that some one of your many friends here would, through the medium of the African Times and your own instrumentality, expose some grave evils which our authorities overlook, and which are consequently increasing more and more; and, being disappointed, I humbly beg to be excused in asking your indulgence and wonted perseverance whilst I make this attempt at an exposure of one of them.

Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

As in the case of West Africa, the slave trade figured prominently in the process by which the region, especially north of the Zambezi river, became part of the periphery of the international trading system. Despite some basic similarities, there were important differences. Many of the captives were exported to the Indian Ocean plantation system, Madagascar and the Middle East rather than to the New World. There was also the very significant role of the ivory trade, and the fact that the far-reaching changes accompanying this involvement in international trade were compressed into a much shorter time-frame. Moreover, the level of violence that accompanied the slave trade was probably higher in Central Africa, creating unprecedented fragmentation and rural dislocation. While some Central African trading societies, or at least the dominant class within them, benefited in the short run through their participation in the ivory and slave trade, they ultimately became subordinate to and dependent upon the international trading system whose centres of decision-making lay outside Africa. 22 Several factors operated simultaneously to expand the slave trade during the first half of the nineteenth century. As a result of the resurgence of the plantation system in north-eastern Brazil and the subsequent development of sugar estates in Cuba, slave-traders in appreciable numbers from the West Indies and Latin America began to visit Mozambican ports where captives were generally cheaper than in West Africa and the limited British naval force far less intimidating.$^{23}$ Simultaneously, French planters on the islands of Bourbon (now called RØunion), Seychelles and the Mascarenes, as well as the rulers of Madagascar, intensified their demand for slaves. The most significant stimulant, however, was the development of clove plantations on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba shortly after the turn of the century. 24 Conditions within Central Africa facilitated the growing demand for slave labour. Bisa, Yao and Chikunda trade networks already linked the interior to the coastal markets of Kilwa, Mozambique Island and Quelimane. Despite their initial emphasis on ivory, the inland traders had always brought a small but steady supply of slaves to these international entrepôts. The use of captives as ivory porters facilitated the addition of a larger slave component without disrupting the commerce in elephant tusks.

When later the European traders were faced with lower profit margins, they decided to pay their Arab retainers in slaves rather than in cash, and this intensified the slave trade. Kaka in northern Shillukland soon emerged as a major slave market, especially for slaves coming from the southern zeribas. The boom at Kaka was partly connected with the abolition of the slave trade in the Turkish-controlled Sudan in 1854. It became the main slave market of the White Nile, and its immigrant population swelled rapidly. The activities of the freebooter, Muhammad al-Khäyr, a Dongalawi by birth, who moved to Kaka from Taqali in 1854, may also have facilitated the transformation of Kaka into a slave market. 25 It is estimated that by i860, an average of 2000 slaves were being sold annually at Kaka and, to acquire this number, Khâyr and his slave gangs were terrorizing the whole Shilluk countryside.$^{2}$^ The southerners refused to co-operate with the traders and actively resisted their presence in their land.

This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders.

First, the manner in which slaves were procured tended to destroy social and political structures. Social outcasts, offenders against the law, were sold into slavery. A few persons were sold in times of famine or for debt. But the majority of slaves were apparently taken by kidnapping, raiding and wars. The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda. Accordingly, the extensive influence exercised by the Aro over Igboland through its oracle did not become an integrative force.$^{9}$ The element of violence inherent in Aro addiction to the slave trade thus distinguished their influence from the earlier ritual influ› ence of the Nri people over wide areas of Igboland.\nIn the economic sphere also, the disruption to normal agricultural activities must have been considerable. In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars. The metal bars were turned into pewters, ritual bells, state swords, leg-rings, and other ornaments.

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'Much the same doubts could be cast on another of the trade goods, guns.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well.

Plantation slavery emerged, either in the form of slave settlements in the rural areas managed according to customary law on the Guinea coast, or Islamic law in the Muslim areas, or approximating to American-type plantations in the Indian Ocean islands. With the increased use of people of slave origin as warriors and in administrative positions at various courts, it has been estimated that in many parts of Africa slave populations could range between 25 and 50 per cent of the total population.$^{19}$ Although there were examples of slave revolts, and the particular example of the Lozi who threw off their Kololo overlords,$^{20}$ generally the slave populations did not form a distinct class.

Elsewhere, the prevalent ethos was acculturation and integration into the society through individual households. While the degree of integration was clearly limited - as witnessed by the number anxious to be redeemed or, having been emancipated by colonial laws, who were anxious to return to their original homes - it was real enough to suggest that the dynamics of change in most of the African communities was the tension of age and sex within each household, and of status and competition for power between the lineages and kinship groups, rather than between broad classes in society.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The diaspora in Europe', 'content': 'Although the African diaspora took place mainly through the slave trade, Africans also found their way into the outer world as free people inde› pendent of the slave trade, or as a new phase of life after a period of slavery in the tropical Americas.

Then, as the direct maritime trade from Europe began to open in the second half of the century, still larger numbers of Africans appeared in Europe. 30 Many were slaves at first, especially in Portugal, the only significant slave-trading European power till nearly the middle of the seventeenth century. Over time, however, many found their way into the broader European society, though often at the bottom of the social hierarchy, since their social condition was assimilated to that of their fellow Africans who did most of the physical labour in the tropical colonies. Their legal status was also ambiguous. The law, in northern Europe generally, no longer recognized the status of slave, though European colonial laws did. From 1685, residence in France was held to confer freedom, and the same was true of England after the notable judicial decision of Lord Mansfield in 1772 already noted.

He would refer briefly to what he conceived to be the object of these settlements, and on this point he was glad to find that in the main he agreed with the noble lord. Certainly it was not colonisation. To that climate no man living would wish to see the Anglo-Saxon race emigrate, and colonisation was never attempted there. The purpose of the settlements was merely to be ancillary to our other efforts for the extinction of the slave-trade, and to prevent the recurrence of the horrors that had been perpetrated in that part of the world. How far the four settlements answered this purpose it would be for the committee to inquire. Whereas in 1700 the whole of the Coast was subject to the slave-trade, now it was limited by the squadron to a few places; and now one of the steamers of which they had heard was lying at one of those places ready to start, but was prevented by the vigilance of the squadron. Our policy being the object in view, it was a question whether it was desirable to have four separate governors, and whether four different settlements did not encourage four different policies; whether the expense might not be diminished by having one government, and whether four separate military forces had not to be kept up, as each governor would naturally wish to acquire the maximum force, to be prepared for any difficulty which might arise, and whether having four governors was not likely to encourage the occurrence of four difficulties at one time, whereas under one governor he would temporise and dispose of one before he got into another. For these reasons he thought there was a legitimate subject for inquiry, particularly as he found a considerable increase in the number of troops kept on the Coast, and that an increase of force did not satisfy the demand, because that demand was still increasing. He found, also, that the buildings in the colony were not sufficient for the troops, and that it would be necessary to come to the House for a vote, but he was unwilling to do so pending the inquiry which he knew would take place upon that point, and also because he knew that the force at the Gold Coast must be removed before the commencement of the next rainy season. The conclusion, therefore, which the Government came to was not to ask the House for an increased vote of money for buildings, though he would have been prepared to deal with the question but for the intended inquiry. All the surrounding circumstances of the case led him to think that there should be a committee of inquiry, and another strong reason for wishing for the assistance of a parliamentary committee was that this was not a new question, but it was one which rested upon high and great authority—viz., that of a committee on which sat Lord Derby, who was at the time Colonial Secretary; Earl Russell, who had since been Colonial Secretary; and Mr. Speaker, and many other members of influence; and it was upon their express recommendation that a governor was appointed for Sierra Leone. He said, therefore, that it would be most right to have the authority of a fresh committee and further evidence, in order that they might decide the question as to what should be done in the future. The right hon. gentleman having given notice of inquiry, he had prepared for it during the recess, and to that end he had requested General Ord, the Governor of Bermuda, who was at home upon leave, to visit the Coast of Africa, and he had done so, and had since returned; and when the committee met, the instructions which were given him and his report, which had not yet been presented, would be laid before them. General Ord believed that these settlements were important auxiliaries for the purposes for which they were instituted; that many alterations might be made for increasing the efficiency and diminishing the expenses of those establishments; and it was in accordance with his general recommendations that the Secretary at War and himself had taken the step of reducing the force employed upon the Coast. He had thus shown the views which the Government entertained as to its being safe and expedient to diminish the military force. He would enter into the inquiry with the greatest pleasure, and he sincerely trusted that the result of the inquiries would be not only increased efficiency and economy in the settlements which they might think it expedient to maintain upon the Coast of Africa, but he also earnestly trusted that the committee would go into the inquiry in the spirit which the right hon. gentleman had predicated, though not in a spirit to withdraw their noble efforts for the suppression of the slave-trade, but that those efforts should be made still more efficient for the purposes for which they were instituted, for he knew of no efforts more noble in which this country had ever engaged. Nor, looking round at what was passing in other nations, he thought that this was not the time for flinching from the task they had undertaken; but that the sense of universal detestation and determination to abolish this infamous traffic, should induce them to continue those efforts, and thus bring about a result not less glorious than that which was accomplished on the day when this country abolished slavery in our own colonies.""}, {'id': 5725, 'article_title': 'THE ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY', 'full_section_title': 'THE ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY', 'last_edit_date': '07-31-1888', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1888#article-3', 'issue_date': '01_08_1888', 'content': ""Lord GRANVILLE had to apologise for the short time he would be enabled to stay at the meeting, as his presence was required in the House of Lords; but Mr. Sturge, the Chairman of the Society, clothed with the authority which his name and his labour had given him, would take his (Lord Granville's) place. He was not quite sure that the fact of a member of the Society of Friends presiding over a meeting graced by the presence of Cardinal Lavigerie, Bishops, Archbishops, and most distinguished clergy and laymen, representing different politics and religious persuasions, did not accentuate the fact that there were things on which they differed. But they all agreed that slavery and the slave trade were contrary to the laws of natural and revealed religion, and hateful in the sight of that God who watched over all of us. They had been summoned there that afternoon to hear what the Cardinal had to tell them with regard to slavery in Africa. He did not believe that his Eminence would inculcate upon them the abstract iniquity of slavery and the slave trade, for in that case he would be preaching to converts. It was true that some time ago we, by the introduction of European energy, by opening the lucrative and large markets, gave a stimulus to the slave trade which had existed for time immemorial in Africa; but, during a hundred years, we had done something to wipe off the reproach. He thought that his Eminence would speak to them of the increase of the slave trade in the centre and the East of Africa, confirming the information which we had received from our explorers, our missionaries, and from Her Majesty's Consuls. He thought and hoped he (the Cardinal) would give them his views as to the best means of combating this evil. They would agree with him in thinking that it would be absurd for Englishmen, who had got possession of the most favoured spots in the uncivilized world, that we should be jealous of any other European nation desiring to increase their opportunities of promoting civilization. Belgium, France, Germany had lately been pursuing that policy, and as a consequence we were in possession of greater rights and of greater responsibilities, and the nations he had just mentioned would feel with us the weight of that responsibility. In 1815, at the Congress at Vienna, there was a strong condemnation of the slave trade. In 1822, at a Conference at Verona, the Duke of Wellington endeavoured to have the slave trade declared piracy. At the Congress of Berlin our Plenipotentiaries found it impossible to bring forward the question at all. He was not sure that at this moment there was any obstacle to these nations coming together, and trying to arrive at the most judicious method for the purpose of putting an end to, or greatly diminishing, the horrors which he was afraid even exceeded the former Trans-oceanic traffic.

Few, we believe, will have been prepared for such an announcement as this. Yet, although it appeared in all our daily papers, we have not seen any other notice taken in them of the alleged facts—any condemnation of Turkey—any censure of ourselves. We have been holding public meetings in condemnation of the East African Slave Trade, the British Government has been sending out a special envoy to Zanzibar, and is understood to be adopting efficacious measures for putting an end to the traffic from Africa to Persia and Arabia—all highly commendable, and our most obvious duty—but yet here we have the Slave Trade, the foreign African Slave Trade, carried on under our very eyes—carried on where we can intercept and destroy it forthwith, if we so choose, without any extraordinary effort on our part to do so being required,—here we have it, duly exposed as an item of news in the columns of all the London daily papers, without its having elicited any justly indignant comments, provoked any addresses to Her Majesty\'s Government, or even, so far as we can learn (not having been ourself present), given rise to a single remark at the Baroness Burdett Coutts\' evening reunion, where a Wilberforce, the Bishop of Winchester, presided over the Anti-Slave Trade Conversazione. We should have imagined that, if any item of Slave Trade news could possibly excite attention and rouse indignation, it would be such an item as this. For what does this Mediterranean Slave Trade from Tripoli to Constantinople, in steamer via Malta, mean? Where do these poor wretches thus conveyed to their final destination, come from? Alas! they have previously formed part of one of those caravans of slaves which traverse the Great Desert, from Bornou, in Central Africa, to Tripoli, the whole route of which through that Desert is clearly marked by the bleached bones of innumerable human victims of that accursed trade, carried on in Central as in Eastern Africa by Mahomedans for the supply of Mahometan countries. We have been too long accustomed to hear that this Central African Slave Trade from Bornou to Tripoli (the intense horrors of which have been often exposed, and are again exposed in the little work by Mons. Berlioz, which we are reproducing in our columns) cannot be reached by any effort of the British Government. This assertion has been invariably denied by us. It has been well known that the final destination, the profitable market, for perhaps the greater portion of the survivors of those horrible caravans, was in Turkey; and that, in some way or other, they were constantly being conveyed to Smyrna and Constantinople. Is it not, therefore, evident that a little energy and honest determination on the part of the British Government would suffice to break this final link in the chain of the traffic; and that without any very great sacrifices being necessary to effect it? There cannot be any reasonable doubt on this point; and there being no room for any such doubt, makes us to be clearly criminal participators in all the worst barbarities and horrors of that Central African Slave Trade, which we profess so vehemently to deplore and to condemn.

During many weeks, the preparations and the departure fill the capital with noise and bustle. Long files of camels are laden with provisions, two thousand armed men serve as an escort, and the human flock altogether counts four thousand heads. For the Sultan, for his horsemen, for his wholesale merchants, for the entire city, the caravan season is a great annual festivity; for the slave, it is the moment of banishment, the renewal of sufferings, and perhaps the eve of his death.

L. Cameron, R.N., C.B. The Earl of Dundonald was in the chair.\n\nCommander Lovett Cameron, in the course of his opening remarks, said the slave trade went on all round the continent of Africa, and commerce had gone on with it. Our trade with the West Coast of Africa had gone on since the time of the Tudors. For centuries that trade was in slaves, and its increase was slow; but after several blows had been struck at that trade—among others by the liberation of slaves in the West Indian Islands, in America, and in Cuba—instead of their being any injury done to our commerce, our trade with the West Coast of Africa increased by leaps and bounds. It was only in 1850 or shortly after that we attacked a great nest of slave dealers in Lagos, and in 1861 it was made a British colony. Up to that time there had been no trade there except in slaves; but last year the trade of Lagos amounted to £357,831 imports, and £538,980 exports. And yet only thirty-eight years ago that place was of absolutely no value to us for legitimate commerce. On the Gold Coast slavery had been practically abolished by the British Government, but yet there was a good deal still existing owing to the native customs of the people. Even if the export of slaves from Africa was prevented entirely, the internal trade in them would still be enormous.\n\nFormerly the slave trade was subsidiary to the ivory trade, but when porters were no longer wanted for the latter, the former remained, only the men were killed and the women and children carried away. It had been said that domestic slavery must be allowed, and that was a very difficult question to settle. In his opinion, we should, as in India, abolish the legal status of slavery, but should not rout out all the households where no complaint was made. As long as domestic slavery existed there would be a market for slaves. We must have nothing to do with slavery; while the slave trade continued it was impossible for legitimate commerce to go on as it should! If the slave trade were done away with, they would find that all other trade would flourish.\n\nIn answer to questions Commander Lovett Cameron said he had avoided speaking of the Germans for diplomatic reasons.\n\nHe had a plan for the total abolition of slavery in Africa, which he hoped to explain shortly. It was, in brief, to establish a barricade across the country by the way of the lakes, and to get authority to maintain order on that line.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, on February 26, presided over a large meeting, held in Exeter Hall, when two African explorers, Commander Cameron and Captain Hore, were announced to speak.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-03-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_03_1889#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICAN PROSPECTS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'And now Portugal must—must put an end to the slave-trade from her East African possessions—or if she is unable to do so must be constrained to withdraw from the scene and allow some one else to do it for her.

This trade, once inaugurated, was carried on by the Egyptians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and Europeans down to the end of the last century, when the revival of human feeling urged certain philanthropists in England to move towards the abolition of a great evil. But during all this period the negro himself was as much to blame as the white and yellow men; indeed, it was probable that negroes were enslaving negroes long before Egyptian or Arab bought black servants from the negro chiefs, and at the present day there would be no slavery in Africa if an approval of slavery were not present in the philosophy of the negro tribes of Africa. Slavery and the slave trade, with the tribal wars and their attendant insecurity, had been the cause of Africa's backward condition, and if ever that Continent were to be raised to the civilisation of Europe, slavery and the slave trade must be extirpated. The two great slave markets which, until a few years ago, had existed in America, and in Turkey and Persia rendered the inducements to slave traders so great that the guarding of the coasts of Africa by British cruisers only checked the trade in a very slight degree; and even now many slaves were sent to Arabia, Persia, and Madagascar. In the present day, however, Africa was the main consumer of its own slaves. The most remarkable revival of the slave trade and occurred in German East Africa. The Germans, under Major Von Wissmann, began by suppressing a revolt of the Arab slave dealers, which led to the almost complete extinction of the oversea slave traffic on the German coast of East Africa; but the organisation of a strong government led to the rapid settling down of the Arabs as great landed proprietors, with an unlimited number of slaves to work their plantations. Legally slavery could not exist in German territory, but in such a wide and sparsely populated region it was impossible to prevent it in fact; and as the slaves were ordinarily well and kindly treated, it never occurred to them to want to leave their masters or to better their condition. It might be asked where, then, was the harm of slavery? The harm lay in this, that slavery commenced with an initial evil. The speaker then drew a picture of the loss of life, devastation of countries, and breaking of family ties which attended a capture of slaves. This depopulation of whole regions was attended with another evil, the return of the dreaded tsetse fly; and the surest way of extirpating this pest was to encourage population in the fertile districts of Central Africa. They must not expect much from the people themselves.

Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

The textbook highlights the significant political impact of foreign rule, noting the loss of sovereignty of African states and the imposition of fixed colonial boundaries that disrupted traditional political and economic zones. It emphasizes Africa's incorporation into the capitalist world-economy, driven partly by the slave trade, and the cultural devastation caused by the slave trade and colonialism, including the suppression of African cultural values and the imposition of foreign control. The racial discrimination and social humiliation faced by Africans under colonial rule contributed to a sense of inferiority and influenced the educated elite's push for independence. Economic transformations, such as the increased use of slave labor and the rise of new bureaucratic groups linked to the colonial economy, are also noted. Similarly, The African Times articles discuss the devastating effects of the slave trade on African societies and the challenges in eradicating it, despite European efforts. They highlight the role of European powers in partitioning Africa, with countries like France, Germany, and England establishing control over African territories, significantly altering the continent's political landscape.

Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

These facilitated, partly caused, and were also in part the result of the changes we have noted above in the political structures and military systems. More than that, there was a growing demand for labour outside the customary bounds of the household unit, the village community or age grade associations. While the various societies remained resistant to freemen selling their labour, the predominant tendency in the nineteenth century was towards expansion of the scale of slave labour, an increase in the areas in which enforced labour was used, and a greater use of migrant labour. The general trend in the third quarter of the nineteenth century was for increased slaveholding in general, even in rural areas, an increase in the number of slaves held within each household, and an increase in the use of slaves in production under quasi-capitalist conditions, thus making their lives harsher than ever before. 18 With the intensification of political rivalries from the very beginning of the century, it became usual to press disputes over land, cattle, and even doctrinal differences to the point of completely destroying the enemy as an identifiable entity. Whole communities were incorporated into existing polities or dispersed and the bulk of the young men and women taken away as captives. Such captives were used to satisfy the increasing demand for labour in agriculture, craft production and mining and also as warriors in the emerging professional armies. The new state structures and military systems diminished the importance of the old aristocracies, whose members had depended on the accumulation of wives and extended families for their social, economic and political support, but they also created new bureaucratic groups that needed to be freed from normal agricultural duties. These new aristocracies depended not on large kinship groups as such, but on large households of clients and captives who maintained increasingly large farms to provision the household as well as groups of warriors at the battlefront. They were also deployed to produce goods for the local markets and for long-distance trade, so as to acquire the wealth necessary to attract more clients and buy imported arms and ammunition.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""It is clear that, at some point, the slave-dealers were no longer 'foraging' for persons to be enslaved but had begun to be engaged in systematic It should also be noted that the total curve for Africa masks a geographic shift.

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

Does it constitute a break with Africa's past or was it just a mere episode in its history, an episode which is of limited importance and which did not affect the course of African development? Here again, conflicting answers have been given to this question. To some historians, indeed a very large number, including the Marxist and the development and anti-development theorists but for very different reasons, though colonialism was a short interlude, it nevertheless was of great significance for Africa and left an indelible impression on Africa. As R. Oliver and N. Atmore contend: 'Measured on the time-scale of history, the colonial period was but an interlude of comparatively short duration. But it was an interlude that radically changed the direction and momentum of African history.'$^{50}$ Gann and Duignan also regard the colonial era 'as most decisive for the future of Africa'.$^{51}$ The answer of the Marxists and the underdevelopment theorists is neatly summed up in the title of Rodney's book, namely, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa.

Hopkins has also maintained that the 'colonial era has ceased to be regarded as the sole substance of African history and there are sound reasons for thinking that colonial rule itself had a less dramatic and a less pervasive economic impact than was once supposed'. He has insisted that colonial› ism did 'not create modernity out of backwardness by suddenly disrupting a traditional state of low-level equilibrium' and that 'the main function of the new rulers was to give impetus to a process of economic development which was already under way'. 53 To this author, there is really no simple yes or no answer to this question since the impact of colonialism"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""By 1935, as is evident from the earlier chapters of this volume, colonialism had been firmly fastened on Africa like a steel grid, and it looked as if it was going to remain there forever.

In some cases, the influences from Africa were strong enough and pervasive enough to forge a genuine Afro-American culture competing with, and sometimes complementing the Europeanderived culture.\nIn the USA the political-structure imposed a rigid dichotomy between black and white in the population, relegating any individual with any degree of African ancestry to the category of black.$^{51}$ By contrast, throughout the rest of the hemisphere a three-tiered social categorization prevailed, corres› ponding to the dominant groups of black, mixed, and white. The relatively small number of white persons at the top of the social pyramid in most societies afforded the dominant African majorities the opportunity to impose their values and their cultures on the rest of the society.\nWithin the three-tiered structure each caste had its own set of legal rights and social privileges based on a combination of wealth, colour and occupation. In the sugar and plantation-based economic zones of Brazil, the Caribbean, and the lowlands of Mexico, Colombia and Peru, the rights of slaves as well as free persons of colour tended to be circumscribed in direct proportion to the overall demands of their labour.

Taking a bird's-eye view of the whole situation in time and space, so that each factor might assume its proper relative position and proportion, he unhesitatingly affirmed in the plainest language that so far their intercourse with African races, instead of being a blessing, had been little better than an unmitigated curse to them. These were strong statements, they would say, and required confirmation. If true, what could possibly have caused this frightful miscarriage of the noblest aspirations of a Christian people?

It has witnessed the definite transference of the entire tract from the dominion of savage and barbarous tribes to the hands of various European Powers—notably, France, Germany, and England. Whilst all of these, and particularly England, have had commercial relations with the West Coast for many years, it has only been during the last couple of decades that the territory has been portioned out, and European ascendency over the Native races made itself felt finally and irremovably. No more concise or accurate summary of the march of events in this portion of the African continent is probably to be found anywhere than that contained in Vol. III. of Mr. C. B. Lucas\'s ""Historical Geography of the British Colonies"" (Frowde).\n\nIn discussing the influences which have combined to render possible that fairly precise delimitation of frontiers in West Africa which any ordinary map of the continent now displays, Mr. Lucas points out that nations take to colonial enterprise for the most opposite reasons—sometimes in consequence of a great failure, sometimes in consequence of a great success. Thus, for example, when this country lost its American colonies, our people found compensation in colonising Australia, and when the French were defeated by the Germans in the war of 1870, and were deprived of their provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, they appear to have concentrated their energies in an endeavour to extend the boundaries of their colonial empire. On the other hand, as soon as Portugal had taken its present form and shape, as soon as it became a country and a nation, Portuguese enterprise began to overflow into Africa. The great Spanish empire in America was founded on the heels of the consolidation of Spain by the union of Arragon and Castile. For the Germans the result of the war of 1870 was to consolidate the German nation, and when it ended they wanted new openings. These they found outside Europe—in the Pacific and in Africa. In Italy, too, the same law of national life is operating; but up to the present Italy\'s colonial enterprises have not been characterised by a striking measure of success.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-05-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_05_1897#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.619, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Leader', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""An international agreement, based upon such ideas as the above, would form a basis from which the gradual suppression from the seaboard of this fearful trade might be made practicable. Apart from local domestic slavery, which is slavery in its least objectionable form, there are two branches of slave-holding that must be considered. The slave holders of the present day are either subjects of those Mahometan Governments which are by courtesy described as civilised, or they belong to the Mahometan tribes of uncivilised Africa, which also supply the slave hunters. Upon the Mahometan people a two-fold influence can be brought to bear. In the first place, the closing of the seas to the trade will put a stop to the supply of slaves; and secondly, the influence of civilised opinion may in time modify their traditional system. It is doubtful, however, whether the clearing of the seas will close all the markets of the slave hunters. In all probability there is a considerable demand in the region between the Nile, the Niger, and the Congo, which it is not possible for Europe to check under present circumstances.\n\nThe disappearance of slavery from the world implies as a precedent condition the reign of law in Africa. It implies the subjugation of the whole continent by European civilisation. There is no reason to take a gloomy view of the future, but there is also no wisdom in shutting our eyes to the nature of the issue involved. Mr. Buxton's resolution will be of immense service if it helps to expose the true nature of the recent attitude of Europe towards the peoples of the Dark Continent. There is little doubt that the responsibility which European nations have now assumed in respect to Africa and the present desolations are related to one another as cause and effect. The recent scramble for Africa has done infinite harm. The flags of European nations have been floated over vast areas where there is no orderly administration of law; and the result has been to undo the work of a generation of heroes, and to bring back chaos where order was beginning.

The Phoenicians treated the part of Africa which they colonised as the British would, as the foundation of trade and commerce. The Phoenicians were followed, about 650 B.C., by the Greeks, who founded their first African colony Cyrene, on the coast of Tripoli. Then came the Carthaginians. They and the Greeks carried on a busy commerce all along the Mediterranean coast, far down to the Atlantic coast, to the mouth of the Red Sea. These were followed by the Romans, who continued an active career on the African coast until the decay of the Roman Empire.\n\nMr. Scott Keltie showed how little was known of the interior of Africa up to 150 A.D. by Ptolemy\'s map being thrown on to the sheet in the darkened theatre. This map, which was filled up haphazard fashion, gathered up, the lecturer said, all the knowledge of the continent which had accumulated during this long period of commercial activity — a knowledge which amounted to very little beyond the coasts and the Nile Valley. The next important period dealt with was the period of Arab invasion and the spread of the tenets of Mohammedanism — namely, from the seventh to the fifteenth century. In the early part of the fifteenth century commenced the ""glorious"" period of Portuguese activity, which lasted for some sixty years, during which the contour of the coast of Africa was completely laid down. This began the real modern partition of Africa, and the lecturer dwelt upon the effect which could be traced to Portuguese occupation of African territory — that occupation being marked by ruin rather than by enterprise. He rapidly traced the occupation of points of territory by Portuguese, Spanish, French, English, Dutch, Danish, and Germans, whose commerce was in ivory and slaves. He held that the opening up of the continent of Africa might be said to have begun with Bruce\'s travels in Abyssinia in the latter part of the eighteenth century. From that time until 1850 nearly the whole map of Africa became gradually filled up, and from 1850 down to the present day the southern half of the continent had received increasing attention at the hands of explorers until it also had had its main features laid down.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

England, France, Portugal, Germany, and Italy are attempting to obtain titles to the country. England has made annexation of the coast lying adjacent to her colony of Sierra Leone; France is forcing her way on the Senegal and toward the head-waters of the Niger; she threatens to annex the coast from the Gaboon to the Congo, some 250 miles, and is running her lines on the Upper Congo. Her Chamber of Deputies has granted the De Brazza mission, by a vote of 449 to 3, a credit of a million and a quarter of francs. The Portuguese Government has appointed explorers and examined the Congo country, and assumes to exercise control over all the territory at the mouth of the Congo. The German Reichstag has increased its annual appropriation for the exploration of Africa. Italy has despatched a party to Abyssinia for geographical and mercantile purposes. She has also concluded treaties which promise to make Assab a centre of commerce. The Sultan of Morocco has authorized Spain to take possession of Santa Cruz del Mar, and the Sultan of Zanzibar has purchased six superior steamers to constitute a regular coast service, in the interest of commerce and for the suppression of the slave-trade.
