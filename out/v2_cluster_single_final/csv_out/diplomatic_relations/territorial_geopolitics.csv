24,"Liberia's economic and territorial ambitions, influenced by American connections and geopolitical dynamics, were shaped by its strategic importance and the complex interplay of European colonial interests and American diplomatic interventions during the colonial period in Africa.","The observations from both the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of Liberia's economic and territorial ambitions during the colonial period, influenced by American connections and geopolitical dynamics. The textbook highlights Liberia's establishment by the American Colonization Society with U.S. government assistance, underscoring early American influence. It details how Liberia's territorial expansion and economic activities were shaped by competition with European powers like Britain and France, who sought control over African territories. Liberia's economic struggles and indebtedness led to increased foreign control, notably by European and American interests, including the significant influence of Firestone and the United States. The complex interplay of European colonial interests and American diplomatic interventions is evident in negotiations involving the League of Nations and the U.S. to address Liberia's challenges. However, the textbook does not explicitly mention Liberia's strategic importance. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize Liberia's strategic importance, noting its potential as a central depot for American trade and its rich natural resources, which attracted American investment. The articles highlight Liberia's territorial ambitions, such as its claims to the Shebar and Jong Rivers, reflecting an American-style expansionist mindset, despite British resistance. They also discuss Liberia's appeal to the U.S. for protection against European powers, illustrating the complex interplay of American diplomatic interventions. Additionally, the articles note Liberia's economic challenges, such as insufficient revenue and infrastructure needs, influenced by its American connections and the geopolitical context. Together, these sources illustrate how Liberia's ambitions were shaped by its strategic importance and the interplay of European and American interests during the colonial period in Africa.","The paragraphs from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook provide several details that support the claim regarding Liberia's economic and territorial ambitions being influenced by American connections and geopolitical dynamics.

Thereafter, up to about 1906, over 18000 New World Africans mostly aided by the ACS settled, annually, in Liberia in congeries of over thirty towns close to the Atlantic littoral on land obtained by the ACS or the Liberian government from the African chiefs of the region. Almost all of them were Afro-Americans, but at least 400 were Afro-West Indians from Barbados who emigrated in 1865 and settled together at Crozierville, 13 km inland from Monrovia. Over 5000 Recaptives - mostly from the Congo region - were also settled, particularly between 1844 and 1863, initially in the care of the Americo-Liberians as the New World African settlers and their descendants were collectively designated. 4\nNeeding land for farming, trade, and for building a great nation, and faced with some competition from the British and the French seeking land to build trading factories and military stations, the Americo-Liberians greatly expanded Liberia's territory from the few isolated points on the coast initially leased to them by African chiefs. By December 1875, when the expansion virtually ceased, Liberia allegedly stretched for 960 km along the Atlantic coast and between 320 and 400 km inland and hypothetically as far as the River Niger (see Fig. n.1). It embraced the Americo-Liberian and Recaptive settlements and peoples and the indigenous African ethnic groups and their territories. These groups included the Vai, Dei, Bassa, Kru and Grebo near the coast; and the Gola, Kissi, Bandi, Kpele, Loma, and Mandingo further inland. 5"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.741, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': 'European aggression on Liberian and Ethiopian territory, 1880-1914 > Liberia', 'content': ""Neither invited to, nor represented at, the Berlin Conference, Liberia at first refused to be bound by its decisions such as the principle of 'effective occupation' on the ground.

Liberia's President from 1904 to 1911, Arthur Barclay, aptly stated the issues at stake, arguing in December 1906 that: Liberia was a recognized state long before the Berlin Conference ... and there might be ground on its part to question some of the dicta laid down at that Conference.

It implored these nations to aid Liberia and to mediate 'to arrest a course of events which threaten her destruction'. Among the few governments to reply was that of the United States, to which Liberians particularly looked for intervention to secure 'a just arrangement' of the boundary question. But the United States government promptly advised Liberia to acquiesce at the British action, which dimmed the hopes of the Liberians entirely. Most of the other nations appealed to were European and were themselves intensifying existing expansionism or about to seek territorial aggrandizement in Africa.

But for the active intervention of the United States, thanks to the activities of the American Minister Resident in Monrovia, Ernest Lyon, an Afro-American thoroughly in sympathy with Liberia and her leaders' anxiety to obtain American support from 1909 onwards, there is no doubt that Liberia would have fallen victim to the other imperial powers.\nNever at any time was Ethiopia subjected to such persistent intervention by the European imperial powers in her internal affairs.

Secondly, Liberia\'s unfavourable economic, social and administrative conditions became a major issue in the bitter political rivalry between the True Whig and People\'s parties and attracted considerable international attention.

Simultaneously, it reported favourably on Faulkner as a \'progressiveminded citizen\'.$^{79}$ Earlier, too, in 1929, the British press had carried several editorials highly critical of the Liberian government. More importantly, the reports in both the American and British press and other reports by foreign missionaries and visitors accused the Liberian government and certain influential Americo-Liberians of practising slavery, recruiting forced and indentured labour, and exporting or selling migrant labour to European colonies especially to the Spanish island-colony of Fernando Po. 80 Britain spearheaded the foreign attack, condemning the exports and demanding, as in 1907-9, that to ameliorate the unfavourable conditions in Liberia, her government should be placed under European control. 81 The United States similarly berated Liberia about \'the so-called ""export"" of labour from Liberia to Fernando Po ... which seems hardly distinguish› able from organized slave trade\'.

These included an upward revision of the tariff, the reopening of the Liberian hinterland to foreign traders (closed to foreigners since the outbreak of the First World War), and the raising of port and harbour dues.$^{43}$ Simultaneously, the Liberian government welcomed plans by the Universal Negro Improve› ment Association, an American-based nationalist movement of New World blacks led by the Jamaican, Marcus Garvey, to bring capital and black immigrants to Liberia to develop her resources. But those plans never materialized. 44 Fortunately for Liberia, as from late 1923, the performance of the Liberian economy gradually improved.

During the first nine months of 1923, for example, the value of exports exceeded that of the corresponding period for 1922 by $i690oo. 47 Just as Liberian government finances thus began to recover, even brighter prospects for the Liberian economy became foreseeable when in 1926 the American, Harvey S. Firestone obtained from the Liberian government the right to lease for ninety-nine years up to one million acres in Liberia to grow and export rubber, and Liberia secured a loan of $5000000 from the Finance Corporation of America to develop infrastructure including roads, hospitals and schools, as well as to pay her debts.$^{48}$ The loan, which received United States government support, greatly increased the influence of Firestone and the United States in Liberia."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.721, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia on the eve of the Scramble for Africa Liberia > Liberia', 'content': ""The Americo-Liberians practised an essentially western culture in their life style, political institutions, through the use of the English language, individual ownership and perpetual alienation of land, and their adherence to Christianity and monogamy.

In spite of its acknowledged, traditional friendship with Liberia, the United States demonstrated numerous times over during the forced labour crisis that it toed the line of the European colonial powers who had designs on Liberia's sovereignty, particularly in supporting the plan for an international governing commission over Liberia.\nThe great diplomatic competence of the Liberian Government, particu› larly of Liberia's brilliant intellectual President, Edwin J.

By silencing local opposition by force or persuasion, and by most doggedly holding to the principle of selfdetermination for Liberia, the Liberian leaders promoted the cause of their country's sovereignty. However, since Ethiopian leaders including Haile Sellassie were also competent in diplomacy and ardent guardians of their country's sovereignty, the survival of Liberia seems to dwell ultimately in the fact that Ethiopia had a mad, blood-thirsty imperial power as a neighbour who was bent on territorial aggrandizement and above all on avenging Adowa, and therefore on actually attacking Ethiopia.

As indicated above, and for reasons already given above, the Liberian government was perennially nearbankrupt and owed huge debts to local and foreign creditors. By January 1908 Liberia's indebtedness to Britain comprised, according to the British Consul-General at Monrovia, £60000 a year 'for several years' while her indebtedness to German merchants in Liberia amounted to $120000 by September 1905. This indebtedness enabled the imperial powers to constantly interfere in the internal affairs of Liberia during the period under review in a way that they never did in Ethiopia where they were never provided with the cause nor the excuse so to do. Throughout the last three decades of the nineteenth century, the imperial powers sent mission upon mission to Liberia to offer aid to her to pay her debts if she would come under their protection. France did this in 1879, Germany in 1887 and Spain in 1886, and each power offered to regulate Liberia's finances, organize her defence, and establish and control her Frontier Force. At the same time, their resident ambassadors and representatives treated the Liberians with contempt and frequently imposed on her by denouncing her trade, customs and citizenship laws or bullying her to redress their nationals' grievances as Britain did in September 1869, August 1870, April 1871, February and June 1882, November 1886 and finally January 1909. 89 Germany similarly brought in her gunboats to intimidate Liberia in February and October 1881, in August 1897, January and September 1898 and December 1912.

Throughout the nineteenth century, Americo-Liberians' policy was to assimilate the indigenous Africans culturally and politically by 'civilizing' and Christianizing them, and giving them equal rights with the settlers. Although this was achieved to some extent with the Recaptives (who were much less numerous than the settlers), the Americo-Liberians, mindful of their own privileged position, main› tained tight political control over Liberia by restricting political participa› tion of even those indigenous Africans who were educated. Only very few of them were given the franchise on an equal footing with the AmericoLiberians (although these might themselves be illiterate and poor). The main indigenous African representation (mostly of the coastal Africans) in the Liberian Legislature as from 1875 consisted of African chiefs designated 'referees' (or 'delegates'), after their chiefdoms had paid an annual 'delegate fee' of $100 to the Liberian government. As the delegates 'spoke' through an interpreter solely on ethnic matters and could not vote, they had very little influence on government policy.$^{8}$ Hence both the educated Africans and the chiefs resented their restricted representation. Furthermore the Liberian government sought to maximize its import and export duties and other levies on trade and shipping which constituted its main sources of revenue. To facilitate collection and control of the external trade by Americo-Liberian merchants, from 1839 the government restricted foreign merchants to trade at only six Americo-Liberian portsof-entry. The restrictions and levies alienated both the foreign merchants who resented them, and the indigenous African chiefs who had formerly controlled the external trade and levied the dues. Often, the foreign merchants and chiefs combined to resist or defy the trade restrictions and levies, or to appeal to European states to intervene on their behalf. Thus, at various times during the nineteenth century, the Vai, Kru and Grebo of the Liberian coast put up an armed resistance to Liberian government impositions on their trade. 9"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.723, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Foreign intervention in Liberia and Ethiopia, 1915-35 > Liberia', 'content': 'Foreign intervention in Liberia and Ethiopia, already discussed in Chapter 11, persisted during the period 1915-35.

The Republic, which has an American fondness for stretching out, demands that the Shebar and the Jong River shall constitute the northern limit of Liberia. But the British Commissioners are stated to have been inflexible on the point that the south bank of the Big River should mark the utmost northern extension of the young and ambitious Republic. The British Commissioners have, therefore, gone their way, and the Liberian authorities continue their claim to the Shebar as the boundary.\n\nThere are many important considerations involved in this question. We have not time or space to enter upon them on this occasion. We shall merely say that, despite all assertions to the contrary, when we regard the state of the public revenue, and the disposable forces in Liberia, we are constrained to believe that it would be at present impossible for the Republic, without a most injurious, if not fatal exhaustion, to force the Gallinas to acknowledge her sway, even should the British Government admit her claims to extension as far as the Shebar. We must say that we consider the Gallinas would be a fatal gift to her—or, if not fatal, a most disastrous one for many generations. She has a sufficient stretch of coast without this northern extension; and toward the interior her boundaries are necessarily of the most elastic kind, and the territories ready for her appropriation, whenever she may be able to occupy them, are such as would afford suitable ""locations"" for millions of American immigrants. The climate of the interior, too, is far more healthy than that of the Liberian coast districts; which, among the unhealthy, are proverbially so. The revenue of the Republic scarcely suffices, at present, for the salaries of the Government functionaries; and as it increases, any surplus will be far better appropriated to the extension of good roads and improvement of rivers into the interior than to war on the northern frontier.\n\nAn American engineer, a Mr. Morris, introduced a coffee huller into Liberia, for cracking the very hard exterior shell of the Liberian coffee. When he showed its capabilities it was much praised, and that was something akin to public enthusiasm about it. But before importing any for sale, he demanded a patent protection. This he has great difficulty in obtaining. The Liberians are so innocent and naïve, that ""they cannot conceive what on earth he wants with a patent; why cannot he bring in some machines at once and sell them?"" The Liberians have a keen eye for the ""Almighty Dollar."" The Republic ought to become rapidly wealthy, possessing, as it does, such vast natural resources.\n\nThe Liberian journals are, we regret to see, almost exclusively occupied with the acrimonious quarrel between Mr. (now ex-) President Benson and Mr. Lynch, to which we have before alluded. We had hoped that when the presidential election was over, these controversies, so damaging for a young State, would be at an end.'}, {'id': 325, 'article_title': 'SIERRA LEONE, LIBERIA, AND BRITISH POLICY ON THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA.', 'full_section_title': 'SIERRA LEONE, LIBERIA, AND BRITISH POLICY ON THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1864#article-13', 'issue_date': '23_02_1864', 'content': 'Liberia is dissatisfied. She has not room. Her fifteen thousand civilised and semi-civilised citizens feel themselves cramped. A territory of five hundred miles of seacoast, with an unlimited extent of interior, is not enough for them. She has good ports; she has fine rivers; she has millions upon millions of acres of fertile unoccupied lands. She has every material thing but population and wealth. These would come with a development of her resources. But she has no content. She is devoured by unsatisfied longings. She has an idea of a sort of Monroe doctrine for Africa. Her citizens have brought there exorbitant pretensions with them from the United States. The Solyman, the Gallinas, the Mannu, the Muttan Territories, the coast as far as the Shebar River toward Sierra Leone, are to her what Mordecai at the king\'s gate was to Haman. They provoke her envy and her ire. Unable in any way to take possession of them, even if Great Britain had been so foolish as to find for her a claim where she has no claim, she some time ago included them within her fancied boundaries. She pronounced them to be within her ""political jurisdiction."" That is a fine phrase, and no doubt means something. But to our minds it is an empty pretension, where there is no power to back it.\n\nHaving thus taken to themselves the shadow, the Liberians began to strive for the substance. This, even nominally, only the fiat of Great Britain could give. Considering the proximity of Sierra Leone, and certain treaties and relations of Great Britain with some of the native authorities within the coveted region, this fiat was no slight thing to ask. But, notwithstanding the proverbial modesty of republics, Liberia made up her mind to press for it. She affirmed that she had purchased the sovereignty. At her urgent intreaty, commissioners were finally appointed by the British Government, to agree with her commissioners on a north-western boundary. But when the British commissioners came to investigate the Liberian claims, their shadowy nature was at once apparent. They were compelled to declare that she had no real ones; that beyond Cape Mount district she had really no possessions; that the Big River, instead of the coveted Shebar and the Joung, must constitute her northern boundary.'}, {'id': 339, 'article_title': 'LIBERIA', 'full_section_title': 'LIBERIA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1864#article-4', 'issue_date': '23_05_1864', 'content': 'That indefatigable American missionary, Mr. Hoffman, well known to some of our English friends, has added another laurel to his wreath in the establishment of a ""Home for the Blind,"" at Cape Palmas, in the immediate vicinity of that important institution, St. Mark\'s Hospital, intended for the sick of all nations (see advertisement). The ""Home for the Blind"" is a simple, unpretending stone edifice, and has already two inmates. Every facility exists for extension should funds be forthcoming. Patients are, unhappily, not likely to be wanting. It is said that at the Gambia—our British Gambia—there are not less than *one hundred destitute blind* for whom nothing has even been attempted. It is indeed honourable to the infant negro nationality of Liberia that such institutions as that of St. Mark\'s Hospital and this ""Home for the Blind"" should have been founded on her soil, and advanced to their present state chiefly, we believe, by contributions raised in Liberia. We earnestly recommend these institutions to the sympathising support of our Christian friends, and shall be happy to be made the medium for transmitting their contributions to Mr. Hoffman.\n\nWe are more sorry than surprised to find that the *Liberian Herald* takes exception to our opinion with regard to the North-West Coast Territories, its claim to which was not admitted by the British Commissioners. It thinks we are singularly illogical in objecting to the extension of the Liberian coast line, on the ground that Liberia is not strong enough to occupy and rule the countries in question, and would scatter its strength by spreading (under such circumstances) along the coast—and then pointing to the ""elasticity"" of her interior boundaries, and her power of stretching indefinitely in that direction. The *Liberian Herald* forgets that if the right of Liberia to those coast districts had been established and acknowledged, it must have immediately endeavoured to rule them, which we again assert, without fear of contradiction, would have been ruinous for the Republic—while it need not, and will not, attempt its forward march interiorward until it has acquired that population and wealth which will at the same time necessitate the expansion of its frontiers and enable it to achieve what it requires with unmixed benefit both to itself and to the native territories brought under its civilising sway. We are convinced that our views are more consonant with real Liberian and other African advancement and civilisation than are those of the Liberians who crave an extended coast line. Once for all, we must say that it is ridiculous for Liberia, with such a coast line as she already possesses, to talk of being ""cramped."" She has room enough and to spare for a mighty nationality; if her people become millions, instead of as now, 15,000, there would be room enough for all their civilising energies to work in.'}, {'id': 2999, 'article_title': 'THE WAR IN LIBERIA.', 'full_section_title': 'THE WAR IN LIBERIA.', 'last_edit_date': '10-19-1875', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1875#article-3', 'issue_date': '01_12_1875', 'content': '**THE WAR IN LIBERIA.**'}, {'id': 3043, 'article_title': 'LATEST NEWS FROM LIBERIA', 'full_section_title': 'LATEST NEWS FROM LIBERIA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1876#article-4', 'issue_date': '01_02_1876', 'content': '**LATEST NEWS FROM LIBERIA.**  \n**CAPE PALMAS, 25th December.**—The American barque Jasper has brought up from Monrovia a supply of provisions and two cannon.

Unfortunately, there is no Power to which Liberia can look for protection, unless to the United States. The country is prosperous, and is making great headway in the direction of civilization and wealth; but the fear that the Republic will be swallowed up by some European Power tends greatly to check the progress and development of the country. The Republic is a market for almost every kind of American manufactured goods and of foods. In return the United States gets its palm oil, palm kernels, dye woods, ivory, and coffee, and should a line of steamers be established to run regularly between New York and Liberia the country might become a centre for the shipping of many of the products of Africa, its chief port being convenient as a central depot from which they could be shipped to the United States. The caravans which bring ivory and other products from the interior of Monrovia return bearing American calico, bacon, and general manufactures; but as yet the only means of direct communication between Liberia and the United States is a line of sailing vessels. The mails are brought indirectly by way of England, and are very irregular.

The results of the census in the United States showed that an abnormal increase of the coloured people, in what has been called the ""black belt,"" had taken place during the preceding 10 years; and this increase was of such a character as to lead to the error that the negroes were increasing in the South at a much greater rate than the white population. The difficulty is now one of a slightly different character. The Republic in Africa, an offshoot of the American Commonwealth, and whose population is largely made up by those of their own race who do not feel themselves comfortable in the States, is threatened with a French annexation. Now, although the Republic of Liberia is but small it is growing, and although its population is largely made up of those who have found that America\'s boasted universal hospitality is now nothing more than a sham, still they are not willing to be annexed by the French, who have lately shown a desire to do so.

And now that an American colony in Africa is un fait accompli, and so substantial a fact that the French are setting covetous eyes upon it, it would seem as if America would need to make a new departure, and interest herself in the question thus raised. It is no doubt the large stretch of seaboard on the Gulf of Guinea that belongs to Liberia, more than its trade, that is making the teeth of the French to water. But, however this may be, the Liberians seem to have good cause to fear the French colonising officers that have been planted on their territory. President Cleveland and Secretary Graham have now the appeal of the Liberians under consideration; and if America is to have an outlet for the emigration of their blacks, we can scarcely doubt what the answer will be. If Liberia is annexed against her will and in spite of a protest, it is not difficult to see that there will not likely be any wish on the part of American blacks to try their hand at forming another and similar colony. The negro question has been for long one of the toughest that the Americans have had to handle, and we speak with the utmost sympathy for President Cleveland, who has now to settle the problem of pleasing Liberia without displeasing France. — North British Mail.'}, {'id': 6780, 'article_title': 'The Troubles in Liberia', 'full_section_title': 'The Troubles in Liberia', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-7', 'issue_date': '05_12_1896', 'content': 'The African Company\'s steamer Gaboon, which arrived in the Mersey on Nov. 17, also reports having been interfered with by the Liberian authorities.

The Gaboon stopped to land some passengers, but the gunboat hoisted signals saying that the British steamer must not communicate with the shore. Captain Maddrell had a large number of passenger boys who had been booked for Cape Palmas, and to carry these on would have been a serious matter. He therefore signalled back that he must communicate with the shore as he had passengers to land. The gunboat asked, ""For what place?"" and Captain Maddrell replied, ""Cape Palmas."" The Rocktown then lowered her signals and the passengers were sent ashore. As there were about 100 passengers this took a little time, and while the disembarkation was going on the gunboat was steaming round the British steamer. After completing the landing, the Gaboon proceeded on her voyage. It was conjectured that the intervention took place because the gunboat thought the Gaboon intended to land the passengers at Rocktown, which is not a port of entry. It is suggested that the proper course for the gunboat to pursue is to lie off Rocktown and prevent the Krooboys from coming out. If this were done there could be no chance of any mistakes. On the 28th the Gaboon passed the Alecto, and the Countess of Derby, with Colonel Cardew, Governor of Sierra Leone, on board, on his way to Monrovia to inquire into the treatment of British subjects at Grand Bassa, and the vessels would reach Monrovia that evening.

The other European Powers, one after the other signified their recognition of the Republic. America added her recognition in 1862. President Roberts, who undertook a tour through Europe for the purpose of obtaining the recognition of the Powers, was well received in England, and was not only able to conclude a commercial treaty, but was accepted as an ally in the prosecution of the campaign against the slave trade on the West African coast, and was presented with a gunboat to enable him to carry on the repression of the traffic in Liberian waters. He, in 1849, took an active part in an expedition of the Powers against the slade traders, who had their headquarters in the northern territory lying between Liberia and Sierra Leone. It was felt that if the whole coast could be held under anti-slavery supervision the trade might be extirpated, and in 1850 the West Coast territory to Cape Turner was purchased from the owners and placed under the guardianship of Liberia. Robertsport was founded this year, and commemorates the name of the President. The population of the Republic was rapidly increasing, her territory was extended towards the interior by treaties with the chiefs, and in 1857 the colony of Maryland was by its own request annexed. They now form together the United States of Liberia. Trade and agriculture were encouraged, and order, justice, and civilised institutions spread through the Republic. The restriction by which white men were forbidden to hold land was also removed. Towns were multiplied and exploration of the interior began to attract attention.

It is about 102 years old, thus considerably younger than the Gambia, which almost ranks with Newfoundland as being one of the very first British possessions abroad. Sierra Leone, however, has not much to show for its century of British rule. Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary. Here at present the great Mahommedan Chief Samadu is the actual ruler, and has created one of those African empires which are easily reared by successful robbers with extravagant bloodshed and widespread depredation. Samadu has several times fought the French on the Senegambian frontier, but of late he is said to have concluded peace with them. The productions of Sierra Leone are those of true Western Africa, and the colony is rich and well-favoured in vegetable wealth. It exports palm oil, palm kernels, rubber, gum, camwood, besides skins and benniseed and ground nuts.\n\nLiberia is British in language, and to a great extent in such culture as it possesses, although it enjoys an independent Government. But its native inhabitants, the Kru-boys, are under the delusion that they are British subjects ""of a sort,"" and do not admit any political connexion with the Americanised negroes who claim to govern them. On the east of Liberia, between the frontier and the west boundary of the French Gold Coast, is the Ivory Coast, about 100 miles in extent, and one of the last portions of the African coast, which remains unclaimed, unprotected, and unannexed by any European Power. Such trade as is done with it is purely British, and is chiefly with the town of Bristol.

The first independent civilized African State on the West Coast, she occupies a position of great honour and usefulness. With institutions framed on the model of those of the United States of America, she stands out boldly before the world asserting and proving that there is no lack of natural ability in the civilized African to work the machinery of free institutions. Her President, her judges, her learned professors, are Christian Africans; no white man holds any political position in the country; the nation is essentially negro, and is so far from feeling any need of European or American aid in carrying on the various departments of her government, that she does more than discourage, she prohibits the permanent settlement of white men within her borders. They may come there for purposes of trade, but they are not permitted to acquire landed property; African she is, and exclusively African she is determined to remain. The enemies and libellers of the African race not unfrequently point to Liberia with contempt and ridicule, because she has not obtained in infancy the development of manhood; because, having no capital but what has been created by the industry of her own people, she is not able to undertake those works of civilization which are so much needed for the rapid development of her great natural resources; because, amid the abundant elements of wealth existing in her rich tropical fertility, and with her capability of producing so many objects that Europe requires and is compelled to seek even at the opposite side of the world, her Government is poor, and her revenue insufficient, without constant patriotic self-denial on the part of her principal citizens, for the support of those establishments indispensable to a free Christian State, which includes within her borders a native heathen population more than twenty times exceeding in number the civilized population of which the State really consists. But so far from there being anything in her public condition to justify contempt and ridicule such as our ignorantly-learned anthropologists would heap upon her and her people, every impartial man will find cause in her for wonder and felicitation that a mere handful of people brought to the African Coast from the degrading servitude of the late Slave States of the great American Republic should have fallen into so few errors, and have made such rapid progress. For it must be especially borne in mind that no comparison between Liberia and an English colony would be fair. An English colony, however small the number of emigrants and their descendants may be, is constantly and from its very birth receiving assistance from realized British capital. But the African emigrants from the United States to Liberia have not had any such resources at their back. They or their fathers have been slaves; and their only means of reaching Liberia was by the gift of a free passage, with six months free support after arrival, by the Colonization Society which founded this refuge for emancipated slaves on the West Coast of Africa. There have been no African Crusoes to help to build up this African Republic; the wealth, whatever it may be, within her is only the surplus of what her own people have created, over and above what they required for their own support. The progress thus made must necessarily be slow in comparison with that of an English colony anywhere, although it may be, as it has been in reality, rapid when viewed only in connexion with the elements available for promoting it. But we hope and believe that the time is now approaching when that progress will be greatly stimulated. Liberia, formed of American Africans, strongly imbued with the Republican principles so extreme in the American people, is not likely to attract any new elements of wealth and population from any other country than that from which its present civilized population has been derived. Ardently desiring as we do to see a rapid advance in Liberia, we rejoiced when we foresaw, as an inevitable consequence of the civil war in the United States, an increased emigration of emancipated Africans from those states to Liberia. The extreme change in the position of the late slaves in America, who have been so suddenly elevated from a debasing bondage, from a condition in which they were estimated rather as beasts than as men, to the full privileges of citizenship, political as well as social, has, however, retarded that movement toward Africa which would otherwise have impelled large numbers of the emancipated to Liberia. Still, the desire to become citizens of an exclusively African Republic, and that in Africa, has been gradually spreading in America, and the Colonization Society, who sent a shipload of emigrants in November last, and another in May, will despatch their ship again in November next with a further addition of some 800 for the African Republic. From the published statements of the society we have reason to believe that 4,000 or 5,000 emigrants might have been sent to Liberia during the present year, instead of some 1,500, had the society been in possession of the requisite funds. We must express our hope that the Colonization Society will be able to obtain all the money it may require to realize the spontaneous desires of late American slaves to become Liberian citizens. It is only by a large increase in her civilized industrial population that Liberia can make rapid progress in production and wealth. She is limited to this source of increase by the elements of which she is composed, by the nature of her institutions, and the strong peculiarities of her people; and all who are desirous of seeing the West Coast countries and their peoples emerge from their barbarism and degradation and come within the sphere of Christian civilizing influences should assist the Colonization Society of the United States in conveying emigrants to Liberia. We had hoped that before 1870 her civilized population would there be increased to at least 50,000. She could with the assistance rendered by the society for six months after the arrival of the emigrants in Liberia have very well established the requisite number, or even a greater number, within her borders before that period could they have been sent to her; and such an addition to her civilized labourers on her coasts and the rich lands of her navigable rivers would, we are convinced, soon give to the carping libellers of the African race new and forcible evidence of the just claim of the African to the rights and sympathies of a common brotherhood with the hitherto more favoured European.', 'last_edit_date': '1867-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1867#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE BRITISH POSITION ON THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It is, however, well to observe that the colouring of French maps in regard to the extent of their possessions in these regions is often untrustworthy.

It had no legal existence among the nations. This fact was made apparent by the refusal of foreign ships to pay the duties imposed by its Legislature. The natives of the coast continued to harass it in consequence of its opposition to the slave trade, until the new State found itself between an upper and a nether millstone. Governor Roberts applied himself to overcome each difficulty in turn. He succeeded in persuading the native chiefs to appreciate the advantages of civilisation, and a number were induced to federate for the purpose of abolishing slavery and introducing orderly administration within their borders. The federated body shortly afterwards entered the colony, and in 1845 the territory of the Kroomen was annexed by friendly treaty, thus adding a third county, under the name of Sinou, to the two which already existed. The colony now extended to Grand Sesters. Maryland also widened the area of her administration, and the entire coast was occupied from Cape Mount to San Pedro. The two colonies resolved to make a joint effort at self-assertion. They imposed an ad valorem customs duty of 6 per cent. upon foreign imports, but English merchants refused to admit the right of the Liberians to impose duties, and insisted upon trading freely as with a savage territory. An English ship was seized and detained by the Liberian authorities. It was rescued by force, and the English Government refused to recognise the Liberian Executive. Liberia had no position except as a dependency of the United States, and the prejudice against colour in America caused that Government to give only lukewarm support to the African colony. If it were to exist at all, it was necessary that it should assert its individuality and claim for itself the rights which were denied to it. Under these circumstances the American Colonisation Society came to the resolution to abandon all rights over its protégé and advised it to take its fate boldly into its own hands.

Five hundred, perhaps, at the most. It lies far away from the routes pursued by tourists, and the busy world hears little and knows less of the independent negro State which nestles in a corner of the West African Coast and has been the scene of a series of experiments absolutely unique in history. It was from this part of the African coast that some attempt was to be made to develop the Dark Continent. Emancipated slaves from the United States, now citizens of a republic established by themselves in the land of their forefathers, were to be the torchbearers of civilisation and to carry the lamp of learning to their brethren in the interior. Such was the scheme of the large-hearted and liberal philanthropists who, early in the present century, founded the various colonisation societies in the United States with a view of enabling its negro population to found settlements on the West Coast of Africa. These settlements were gradually formed, and, after passing through a series of trials, eventually confederated. In 1822 the republic was declared, and in 1847 Liberia was recognised as an independent State by the sovereigns of Europe and the United States Government. From Washington the new State borrowed its constitution. Although she has enjoyed the advantage of having had at least three Presidents—E. Johnson, Russworm, and Roberts—of high character and executive ability, it would be untrue to say that the hopes of the founders of Liberia have been realised. On the contrary the Liberian Government seems to have entirely failed to win the confidence or even to gain the respect of the native kings and tribes within its supposed ""sphere of influence""; indeed, some of them resist all attempts to enforce authority within the ill-defined boundaries of the State. At the recent inauguration of the new President—the Hon. — Cheeseman—it was a matter of general satisfaction that a gunboat, ordered from a Keil dockyard, was on her way out from Germany. This boat is to be the foundation of the new Liberian Navy, and, strange to say, it is required, not for the defence of the State, but to coerce a British merchant who for three years has declined to pay customs duty on the ground that he receives no protection from Government, that there is no civilised administration in the district in which he resides, and that he is compelled to employ and pay a police force of his own. The Government, urged by German merchants to suppress their independent competitor, has signified its intention of resorting to force, and will probably find itself in a difficulty with our Foreign Office if a single shot is fired on an English factory whose owner is considered to have made out a good case for non-payment of duty. The attempts of Christian missionaries to evangelise the Western districts of Africa have been discouraging. From the year 1481, when some priests from Rome unsuccessfully endeavoured to withstand the climate, the history of Christian labour is one continuous narrative of a futile struggle against disease and death. Protestant societies in the United States have literally poured dollars by thousands into Liberia. Some good work is being done by white ministers who have formed thriving settlements up the country (where the land is fertile and the climate healthy), and have urged upon the natives the importance of cultivating rice, corn, potatoes, ginger, sugar, coffee, and arrowroot, all of which are remunerative crops. As for cotton, indigo, pepper, pineapples, and gumtrees, they grow wild, and the superior knowledge of the missionaries has enabled the natives to gather them profitably. But Christian workers have to reckon with a foe more stubborn than Paganism. Islam is gradually winning its way towards the West Coast from the interior. The sword, it is true, goes hand in hand with the green banner, but the African negro is a ready convert. He finds the precepts of the Prophet easy to understand, and the sanction of polygamy is in entire accord with his present practice. Moreover, where Mahomet gains ground, intemperance—which unhappily follows Christian missions—disappears. I have said that Liberia is fertile. It is certainly the richest district in West Africa, but it is terribly neglected, and can never thrive under its present administration. There is practically no Government. The rule of the negro is marked by selfishness and corruption. The colonisation societies in the United States have almost abandoned in despair sending out more emigrants who, on landing, finding themselves free from control, quickly become lazy and wholly useless as pioneers for opening up fresh country. It must be confessed, therefore, that, after a trial of seventy years, the American negroes have failed to erect a State worthy of the name. They have lost what little credit they had twenty years ago—not even the interest is paid on the loan of 500,000 dols. raised in London in 1870—and Liberia is gradually drifting into the hands of a few wide-awake German merchants, who are understood to have made advances to Government against valuable securities, as well as to have exerted sufficient influence in Berlin to induce General Caprivi to protest in vigorous language against the concession known as the ""indiarubber monopoly,"" granted by President Johnson to an English syndicate of company promoters under circumstances which have been severely criticised. Lord Salisbury was aware of the facts, but it yet remains to be seen whether the British Government will raise its voice against a German protectorate of Liberia.—""E.

Bush is all that meets the eye, while not a sail is to be seen as far as the eye can reach. There are no towns of any size between Grand Bassa and Harper, but merely a few villages scattered at intervals along the coast. Harper is situated on Cape Palmas, and has a harbour immediately opposite, which is sufficiently commodious and affords ships cruising in this part of the world a pleasant change after the eternal surf of the West African shores. The town looks uncommonly well from the sea. The church spires peep out from amongst the trees, and the shingle-framed houses of the Liberians surrounded by gardens add picturesqueness to the scene. Harper possesses, besides old churches, an academy, a hospital, an orphan asylum, and a lighthouse. The latter is more of ornament than use, as the Republic cannot afford to keep it constantly lighted. Adjacent to the lighthouse is the flagstaff which bears the Liberian national flag, the same as the American ensign, with the exception that instead of many stars there is only one. The practically prohibitive taxation at present imposed by the Government will end in the withdrawal of all Europeans from the country, as it is now an impossibility to get at the interior of the country, and the amount of trade that can be indulged in at the open ports is not sufficiently remunerative in view of the heavy taxation imposed. At present the German traders are anxiously expecting the arrival of the German squadron from Europe, when they are hoping the Admiral in command will bring the requisite pressure to bear on the authorities to induce them to open out to them the interior of the country. The people here may be called prosperous; if they would not ape white men\'s ways, they would be all the better. Some are well educated, and quite *au fait* in the politics of the world, but they appear to have a great dislike to foreigners of any kind, and a wish to keep Liberia wholly and solely for the Liberians. It should be pointed out that the effect of present restrictions is to keep Liberia utterly impotent to enforce her authority within her territory, and to prevent her doing anything to advance the material condition of the country, and that if this policy be persisted in, the inevitable result would be that Liberia would be absorbed by a European Power. The Americans washed their hands of a Liberian protectorate years ago, and are not likely to embroil themselves with any Power over such a figment as ""Liberian independence."" The officials of the Republic are wretchedly paid. The Governor of Harper\'s income is only about £75 a-year; his house is furnished in the meanest style, and he appears to augment his salary by supplying ships with fresh provisions. The constitution of Liberia, as well as the institutions, the manners and customs of the people, and the language itself, appear to be modelled upon those of the United States. The pure Liberian guesses and calculates quite as much as do his white brothers in New York, and speaks with that nasal twang peculiar to the land of the stars and stripes. Manhood suffrage is one of the Liberian institutions, but this ""manhood suffrage"" involves the qualification of being possessed of real property to the extent of fifty dollars. Harper exports little but palm oil, and that little appears to be dwindling to still lower limits. The inhabitants appear to take a deep interest in politics, and elections and the state of parties seem to create as deep and universal interest here as in more civilized countries. A Liberian youth of sixteen or so being asked how often the President was elected, replied ""biennially,"" and proceeded to give an account of the political institutions of the country, which showed that the education of the Liberian youth is thorough, and embraces politics as well as more widely-taught subjects. The President of the Republic resides at Monrovia, the capital, where the Houses of Assembly sit. The salary attached to the Presidential office is only £400 a-year and a residence—not a very magnificent sum, but large enough in this country, where living is cheap, the expenses of life small. The solitary Englishman in Liberia is located at a place called Tabon, and is engaged in trading with the natives. He has for some time refused to pay the exorbitant taxes assessed upon him, and the Government has no force to compel him, with the result that many of the natives are inclined to follow his example. As the Government has no means of transport, they are unable to send any troops from Monrovia to Tabon, from which it is distant about 200 miles, and, probably, even if they could, they would hesitate to do so from fear of complications with the English Government, especially as the boundaries of Liberia are not at present clearly defined, and her Majesty\'s Government has declined to recognize any portion of the country to be Liberian territory when the Government of the country is not capable of enforcing its authority. The officials say that the President has invoked the assistance of the United States, and that an American ship is at present on its way to Tabon, to set matters right; but the Americans are much too cute to trouble themselves over such a paltry matter. A wide and deep river runs into the sea here, but it is ruined by a bar at its mouth, which prevents navigation. This matters little at the present time, but in the future, when Liberia has been annexed or roused from its present state of stagnation, means will probably be found to obviate this fatal impediment to navigation, both here and elsewhere, along the coast. A very few miles off, another large river—the Carallo—discharges itself into the sea, and is likely to become of great commercial importance in the future, as gold washings have been found on its banks. This river has been ascended for nearly 200 miles, and is stated to be navigable for that distance. This country is more valuable in every way than our Gold Coast Colony: it possesses three or four fairly good harbours, whereas the latter cannot boast of one. There is an absence of that terrible surf which makes landing or the transference of cargo almost impossible, and the country itself appears to be more productive, to have greater mineral wealth, and to ""tap"" a more valuable part of the Dark Continent.

Having failed in an attempt to settle at Sherbro, they sought and found refuge on Providence Island, at the mouth of the Mesurado river, and finally on Cape Mesurado, where now stands the capital of the republic.\n\nThe second decade, commencing with 1830, might be called the period of expansion, when the colony at Cape Mesurado feeling itself sufficiently well established began to send out colonies, and planted the settlements at Bassa and Sinoe on the coast, and Millsburg and Caldwell on the St. Paul's.\n\nThe third decade, commencing with 1840, might be called the period of consolidation or independence. During this period the necessity was pressed upon the scattered settlements of not only closely co-operating but of declaring themselves one independent state under the name and style of the Republic of Liberia. It was during this period that the last white governor died, and the colonial Government was assumed and conducted (for five years) by one of the colonists under the direction of the American Colonization Society until July, 1847, when the colony became an independent Republic.\n\nThe fourth decade commences with 1850, and might be called the period of diplomatic extension. It was during this period that most of our treaties with foreign nations were formed, and we became known to the European world.\n\nThe fifth decade begins with 1860, and might be called the agricultural period. It was during this decade that, through the large accessions of recaptured Congoes, our farmers were enabled to extend their cultivation of the soil and prove what was before doubted, that exclusive devotion to the soil will yield a comfortable living and a competence in Liberia.\n\nThe sixth decade begins with 1870, and might be called the period of upheaving. It was during this decade now just closed that the Republic experienced the most serious strain on its domestic and foreign relations; when the thoughtful at home were alarmed and our friends abroad were anxious.

The total product for 1887 was about 1,200,000 lbs., which are distributed as follows: to Germany, 606,000 lbs.; United States, 301,000 lbs.; Belgium, France, and England, 149,000 lbs.; Holland and 150,000 lbs.""\n\nBishop William Taylor, in his Quadrennial Report, states: ""The productive interests of Liberia are fairly prosperous.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome. Similarly, British peace› makers involved in resolving aspects of nineteenth-century Yoruba warfare had to travel virtually throughout the length and breadth of the culture area.\nUnfortunately, the European approach was divisive, tending towards politically structured differentiation. This was already noticeable in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era. British interests came to be specifically protected visà-vis the interest of other European nationals; British interests were also advanced against those of Africans.

The negotiations, however, stumbled over the British insistence that Radama should outlaw the slave trade in Madagascar. When Radama argued that by doing this he would be com› mitting economic suicide because the slave trade was the major source of his revenue, Hastie had a ready answer: the British would pay the Malagasy ruler an annual sum of 1000 dollars in gold, 1000 dollars in silver, a hundred barrels of gunpowder, 100 English muskets with 100 flints, 400 soldiers' uniforms, 12 sergeants' swords, 600 pieces of cloth, a full-dress uniform for himself and 2 horses as compensation.$^{14}$ Radama considered that he had made a fair deal, especially since the treaty also recognized him as king of the whole of Madagascar.

When he ascended the throne in 1894, he seemed to be suspicious of Europeans, mostly missionaries at that time, so he sought to restrict his people's interactions with them. Those among the Baganda who had embraced the Christian faith and who would not obey his orders were put to death as traitors.$^{29}$ Today, Christians regard them as martyrs. Mwanga was, however, violently resisting attempts by British agents to take over his country even though disguised as mission› aries. But his diplomatic ability also became apparent in the way he handled various, often warring religious sects. At one time, he would play the two Christian sects, Catholics and Protestants, against Muslims when he thought the latter were becoming too powerful and therefore threatening his control of the country. At another time, he would ally with Muslims against Catholics or Protestants or both depending on who he thought was dangerous to his rule. Thus, Mwanga was adept at the diplomatic game of divide and rule, a tactic which the colonizing powers were able to use so effectively in controlling Africa. When it was necessary, Mwanga resorted to a revival of some old tradition in an attempt to drive out all foreigners as happened in 1888.$^{30}$ On this occasion, he intended to entice all foreigners and their Baganda followers to a naval parade on an island on Lake Victoria. There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler. Later, however, in 1889, Mwanga managed to regain his throne only to be exiled to Kisimayu, as already indicated, in 1899, where he died in 1903."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.621, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': ""The impact ofthe slave-traders on the political fortunes ofthe indigenous aristocracy was not uniform. In some cases the dominant class emerged stronger as a result of economic and military ties to the slave-traders. Consider relations between the Bemba rulers and the Arab and Swahili traders. Under the leadership of Chileshe Chipela the Bemba had just completed a phase of territorial expansion and political centralization when the foreign traders entered their homeland around i860. As a result, the Bemba kingdom was far more unified and powerful than most states in the region. The geographical position of the Bemba, somewhat removed from the principal trade routes, precluded the growth of a large and potentially seditious merchant community within the core of their kingdom. Equally important, there was no incentive for the Arab and Swahili traders to adopt a hostile posture since the Bemba were not economic rivals. Most of the royal families' wealth came from raiding and tribute in the form of ivory and slaves and they were happy to exchange them for the cloth and other imported goods provided by the coastal merchants. This economic complementarity fostered a harmonious relationship and simultaneously enhanced the internal position of the Bemba aristocracy, which used the foreign commodities to recruit new followers and strengthen their links to subordinate chiefs. The continued demand for captives and ivory also fuelled a new expansionist phase from i860 to 1880, during which Bemba forces conquered most of contemporary north-eastern Zambia. Thus, through ties to foreign merchants, the Bemba rulers gained unprecedented regional power while accumulating a substantial amount of wealth. 43 As in the case of the Bemba, other local chiefs and merchants entered into alliances with the slave-traders that proved extremely beneficial. Throughout the 1870s the Chewa chief, Mwase Kasungu, whose territory straddled the Lake Malawi-Katanga trade route, provided food for the Arab caravans in exchange for guns. These weapons enabled him to withstand the subsequent Mbwela Nguni invasions.$^{44}$ Economic con› siderations also motivated Arab and Swahili protection of the Senga chiefs, who were important suppliers of ivory.$^{45}$ Similar factors help explain Chikunda alliances with the Ambo against the Bemba, and assistance that they provided the Nsenga against the Soli, which occurred in the decade preceding the 'Scramble'.$^{46}$ In all these cases, it is clear that the aliens' strategy was to prevent"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.616, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': ""The third category of states included geographically and culturally distant peoples such as the Dagomba, the Mamprusi and the Gonja.

These non-Akan states to the north were subjected to military and political control because of their economic resources. They also supplied, in the form of tribute, a large part of the manpower used in Asante wars and agriculture.$^{13}$ This significant distinction has been contested on the grounds that economic and political motivations existed in all the Asante wars. In a similar vein, references have been made to the presence of Asante representatives in all types of states and also to the introduction of substantial Asante features into the Dagomba army or interventions by the Asantehene in Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes. 14 It is obvious nevertheless that the mandates of the Asante regional commissioners varied according to the situation. In the Akan regions they had to ensure that disputes were settled by enforcing observance of the Asantehene's oath so as to emphasize his sovereignty over these territories. The collection of taxes in these regions, seen by contemporary European ii. Cf. R.S. Rattray, 1929, pp. 398-409; K.A. Busia, 1951; I.

In non-Akan regions, the com¬ missioners strove to strengthen the terms of the 'treaty' between the Asantehene and the Dagomba, for example,16 concerning the tribute. On the other hand, we have no evidence confirming the presence of Gonja or Dagomba contingents in the Asante army or of payment by these countries of the Asante war tax (apeatoo). The settlement of the Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes must therefore be considered as a political act with economic motives: peace in these territories guaranteed payment of the tribute, as well as the introduction of Asante institutions into the Dagomba army.

In this number of our journal we have also to record the painful news of an active foreign slave-trade at Whydah—of the shipment of nearly 1,000 poor wretches in one steamer, destined for the disgusting shambles of the modern plantations of Cuba, there to be used up in eight or ten years in the production of sugar for the British market. We cannot forget that, on those 1,000 slaves alone, the King obtains a fancied profit of some 10,000l., which we enable the Cuban planters to send him, through the slave-traders, for the supply of the raw material out of which they manufacture sugar for us. We are compelled to bear in mind that at the rate of duty he levies on palm oil shipped at Whydah—viz., one dollar per puncheon—there must be a very large exportation of produce to compensate him for relinquishing the slave-trade. We have also recently obtained a new insight into the dreadful ""Customs"" of Dahomey—of the supposed obligation on the part of the monarch to continue them during his life; and Aboekuta, though a hard nut, perhaps, to crack, has in its numerous population a delicious kernel for the wholesale butcher and slave-dealer. Nevertheless, we hail with joy this manifestation on the part of the King of a desire to enter into some amicable relations with the Christian civilization of this country. And we do indeed earnestly hope that advantage will be taken of it by Her Majesty\'s Government. We stated in our last that Commodore A. Eardley Wilmott had been furnished by them with the presents that would be requisite should he attempt a visit to Abomey. And we know his earnest desire to detach the King of Dahomey from the slave-trade. We have, therefore, reason to believe that when he receives, by the mail which leaves Liverpool to-morrow, this interesting intelligence, which has been communicated through us, he will lose no time but proceed to Whydah as soon as his other duties will permit. The King asks for the light to be brought to him; and such a desire ought to be immediately gratified. It may be only curiosity on his part, or a desire for the presents which he well knows he will receive; or to raise himself still higher in the opinion of his people, through that acknowledgment of him as king by this great nation; or it may be only a ruse on his part, to lull the Aboekutans into a fancied security, so that they may become an easier prey. Still, his desire ought to be complied with; the wishes, and, if necessary, the demands, of this Christian country ought to be diplomatically placed before him. The person whom he has named as interpreter should accompany the British negotiator. And then, should all fail—should no good result be obtained—we shall have at least the satisfaction that we performed our duty. We are not sanguine of any immediate good result, because we have no reason to believe that the negotiator has any power to promise a subsidy on the part of this country, which might compensate (until legitimate commerce should be largely developed) for the fancied pecuniary loss the King would sustain by the abandonment of the slave-trade. But we might expect to learn the amount of subsidy that would induce such abandonment; and it would then be for this country to determine whether it would be our duty or our interest to pay the price.'}, {'id': 83, 'article_title': '1862 AND 1863', 'full_section_title': '1862 AND 1863', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1863#article-13', 'issue_date': '23_01_1863', 'content': ""Civilization and Christianity must go together in Africa, if either is to go forward at all.

The King had kept the Commodore many days waiting before he gave him audience. But when he did admit him to a sight of the African glory, the monarch became enthusiastic: Commodore Wilmot was a messenger from heaven; the Queen of England was the King of Dahomey\'s most beloved sister. He elevated the Queen\'s picture above his head, and told all his people of the intimate relationship that existed between the greatest white Queen and the greatest black King—between their Sovereign and Queen Victoria. And all his people abased themselves in the dust, and rolled themselves in it, and covered themselves with it, before her portrait. They gave her the same honours paid to their King himself. The wrongs done to Her Majesty by the Abeokutans, in not receiving Mr. Consul Taylor, whom she sent to reside among them, became fresh wrongs done to themselves, in virtue of the new relationship between Badahung and Queen Victoria. They would avenge the Queen of England.

This reduction of men was not caused by insufficiency of men; but God has been directing things in that way, and who knows whether the talk of Commodore Wilmot had something to do with this change? Hence, Mr. Editor, you see the necessity of not neglecting any means necessary towards that object which Christian England has in view with the King of Dahomey, for some good will come out, if proper trial be made. The King of Dahomey is very well disposed towards England; and if that Christian country use all her efforts, what may appear difficult for him to see now in the object of his best friend, the Queen of England, those kind efforts will force him to see; and this is evident from the change of feelings which the visit of Commodore Wilmot has brought about in the few months past.

It seemed to us so advisable in the interests of African civilisation that he should be not only allowed, but encouraged and assisted to do so, that we have strenuously advocated the measure. In our May number we made some comments on a letter of the late Commodore on the West Coast station; in which, in pursuance, as we believed of orders from home, the King of Dahomey\'s request was refused. Our correspondence from Dahomey shows us, however, that the King has not accepted this reply of the Commodore as a final decision against him, but has applied directly by letter to Her Majesty\'s Government with the same object. In the article in our May number before alluded to we exposed the error and inconsistency of such a refusal as had been given to the King, and endeavoured once again to show how much that change which we so desire for Dahomey and Ashantee might possibly be forwarded by bringing some of the chief men of those countries into immediate personal contact with our advanced civilisation and all the humane institutions to which the blessed precepts of the Gospel of Peace have given rise among us. There is nothing more necessary to be shown to the authorities of those barbarous countries than the value which we attach to human life; and that although unhappily wars have not ceased among so-called Christian nations, human life is, except upon the battle-field, regarded as a sacred thing, in no case to be wantonly taken away, and in all cases to be hedged round by the supreme authority with all possible protections. We do not know what may be the decision of our Government, and what answer may be sent to the King of Dahomey. We have reason, however, to believe that the arguments put forward by us have not been without effect in modifying opinions in quarters where opposition to the King of Dahomey\'s wishes was known to exist. There is consequently reason to hope that a favourable answer may be accorded, at least to the extent of meeting the King\'s wishes that some of his chiefs should come over to this country, by offering those facilities without which it would be difficult, if not impossible, for them to do so. This, and a formal reception of such envoys by Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, are two very different things. If the latter could by any possibility be construed into an approval of, or even into a cessation of protest against, those horrible barbarities by which Dahomey is polluted, especially in those superstitious ""Customs"" in which human life is so wantonly destroyed, we should say at once that such envoys should not be admitted, either formally or informally, to the Royal presence; but if, as we think there is reason to believe, the personal displeasure of our Sovereign at such atrocities, pronounced by herself in presence of those envoys, might have the effect of inducing the King to put an end at once and for ever to his slave wars and to those appalling ""Customs"" for which Dahomey has become so infamously distinguished, we do venture to express the hope that in the event of the envoys arriving here, some means may be devised by which they may thus become assured of Her Majesty\'s abhorrence of things in which the Kings of Dahomey have delighted, and that Her Majesty considers those things in which they have gloried as incompatible with the existence of any friendly understanding, or interchange of courtesies between herself and him. We do think that some means may be devised by which such a Royal Christian effort might be made in the cause of humanity and of Christian civilisation in Africa without any sacrifice of Royal dignity. The end in view is really a great one. The cessation of slave-hunting wars and of ""Customs"" in Dahomey, and the entry of that country, however feeble at first its steps may be, into the ranks of the world\'s advancing Christian civilisation, would have a great effect on the surrounding countries. A new way would be opened through Dahomey into the interior of Africa. And as the Dahoman Government has long since shown itself alive to the importance of good roads between its principal places, more might possibly be done within a short time in that than in any other native African country in establishing improved communications between the coast and the interior. The visit of the Dahoman envoys to this country, and their judicious reception and entertainment here, are therefore much to be desired. It would be absurd, of course, to bring them over at this time of the year, when they would be exposed to the rigours of winter; but we hope that such an answer may be given to the King\'s application, and such instructions be issued and arrangements made, as may lead to the presence of those men among us some time in the months of May or June of next year.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-09-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_09_1866#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.697, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CIVILIZATION OF AFRICA: ENVOYS FROM DAHOMEY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The mouths of many witnesses, and those his own witnesses too. It is not at all absurd to hope that the reports of his men who had made this personal contact with and inspection of our civilization might induce him to do what we wish him to do. But, no—""whenever the King of Dahomey renounces the slave-trade, gives up human sacrifices, and commences in real earnest the pursuit of legitimate trade,"" then, and not till then, ""it will be time to consider his proposal"" to be allowed to send some of his subjects—his nobles—to England. When he has made so much progress in civilized ideas that the visit of his people to England will have become comparatively unimportant, then they may come. If there were not great interests of humanity, civilization, and Christianity at stake, we might laugh at the absurdity; but when we look at the results to be obtained by the civilization of Dahomey and of Ashantee, and see such a policy as that under consideration announced from England, our heart almost fails within us. Those two countries are being annually drenched with the blood of victims of an atrocious barbarism, and that blood flows, for the most part, not because of a wanton exercise of a savage despotic power, but at the behests of a most sanguinary superstition. And we prefer to cure these people by offering them the bribe, that if they will first become good, and righteous, and humane, and enlightened in their ideas, some half-a-dozen or more of them shall really be brought over to England to have the honour of a peep at us! If they will swallow our pill first, we will, perhaps, give them (""it will be time to consider his proposal"") a little jam and honey afterwards. And this is the way in which our Government, as a Government, thinks that African civilization may be accomplished. The English people, as individuals, know better. They do not say to the poor wretched victims of a cherished barbarous superstition, cast off your false religion, acknowledge two or three of the great truths of Christianity, and then we will see, perhaps, what can be done for you. No, they send their missionaries to tell them what Christianity is—to show them the difference between what it inculcates, and the bloody system under which they have been for so many ages the benighted victims. And why does not the English Government act on the same principles? Does official position, does official life, remove the members of a Government out of the sphere altogether of the principles and sentiments which would influence and govern them as individual Englishmen? It seems very much like this. We cannot send our civilization to Dahomey and Ashantee for them to look at it and contrast it with their own barbarism, as missionaries can show them the simple truths of Christianity, and ask them to compare them with the foul teachings of their Fetish priests. All the sample of civilization we can send them, after having encouraged their sanguinary systems for ages by our long and active prosecution of the slave-trade on their coasts, is war ships and cannon engaged in protecting legitimate trade, and putting down that slave-trade we so long encouraged and participated in; that according to the ideas of those people, we have only abandoned it because we do not want it any longer, and, like dogs in the manger, refuse to let others eat of what we do not ourselves require. Traders, eager, of course, as traders must be, in the pursuit of gain, ""guns, drums, trumpets, blunderbuss, and thunder,"" war ships, and an occasional missionary, are all the show of civilization we can make to them in their own lands. The mountain cannot go to Mahomet, but Mahomet can be brought to the mountain. We cannot extend civilization and its fruits to the Dahoman and Ashantee anywhere but in England. They begin to know and feel this, and are not at all so unreasonable as we are. They do not say, send England over here that we may look at it, but, take us over to England that we may see what it is. And we want them to see it, or, at least, we ought to want them to see it. What is there, then, that stands in the way? There is no doubt in our own mind on the subject. It would cost a thousand pounds or two, and a little trouble, to gratify their wish. And so this great and noble nation takes refuge under a false and hypocritical exaction. And, of course, it does not expect to be found fault with. What can be better than the things it asks the Dahoman to do? Renounce the slave-trade, give up human sacrifices, buy cottons, guns, powder, and rum, and sell palm-oil and such other articles as your country produces! Who can find fault with this? Not we; only the demand or advice is not likely to be granted or acted upon. The people want an adequate motive for the change demanded. We try to give them one when we endeavour by our ships to make it impossible for them to sell slaves for export. And they understand this motive, because they feel the power of its working. Why not add another motive? Why not show them England and its civilization? Have we no faith in ourselves, or our civilization, or our religion, so that we fear their being too closely looked at by strange eyes? No, it is not this, it is that ignoble motive of a little money, as if civilised Dahomey and Ashantee would not repay it to the country ten thousand times over. Away with it.

We think this correspondent takes an exaggerated view of the fighting resources of Dahomey, of the mortal peril of the European detenus there, and of the reckless character of King Gelélé. Affect what he may, this wretched thing of a King will be too wise to cut himself off from all possibility of future reconciliation with Great Britain, which he would do by murdering the Europeans now within his power, as we presume a preliminary summons would be made, in which the King would be distinctly informed that in the event of his injuring those persons, he would open a gulf between himself and the British that could only be closed up by his own dead body. There are some observations, however, in the letter which are so much in keeping with views we have expressed with regard to the Ashanti War and the Dahoman one, should it take place, that we have pleasure in reproducing them. He says, most justly, ""If, however, our troops do intend pushing on to Abomey and giving King Gelélé a lesson, we trust that a more effectual one will be administered than in the case of his neighbour of Ashanti. It will not be enough if we march through the town with colours flying, driving a frightened herd of women and children before us, and finally set fire to a few thatched mud huts, and then hurry back to the coast. Gelélé, should danger menace him, will, in all probability, take to the bush, and, if such should be the case, we ought not to retire until he has been dragged from his concealment, and brought face to face with the commander of the expedition."" The only modification we should make in the above is that the lesson we should give to Gelélé should not stop at anything short of the breaking up of that Power which, so long as it continues to exist, will never cease to offer up its hecatombs of victims at the behest of the sanguinary superstitions which have made Dahomey so odious to all civilized peoples. The concluding remarks we, of course, endorse, since they are in favour of a policy that we have advocated from the first hour in which we heard of the new Gold Coast Colony being proclaimed: ""Finally, we would again urge the necessity there exists of forming a continuous coast-line of British territory from the Assinee River to Lagos. Until this happy event becomes consummated, the traders of the West Coast will ever be subjected to the capricious treatment of petty kinglets, while our revenue will be defrauded by the smuggling, which such gaps render only too easy of performance."" King Gelélé has offered to us an opportunity for realizing this, and it would be the very climax of folly not to avail ourselves of it to the fullest extent.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1876#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE WOULD-BE ASHANTI ENVOYS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The steamer Accra arrived at Grand Canary on April 16, _en route_ for Liverpool, having on board the _soi-disant_ Ashanti Ambassadors, who are visiting England in the hope of waiting upon the Queen to lay before her Majesty a full statement of their case. The mission of these Envoys marks a stage in a series of negotiations. They are six in number, the chief amongst them being Prince A. A. Ossoo-Ansah, a son of Prince Ansah, who, in 1874, after the Ashanti War and the deposition of King Coffee, visited England for the purpose of clearing himself of imputations as to disloyalty to England during that war, and of obtaining compensation for the destruction of his property by the enemy. Prince Ossoo Ansah is the only one of the six who can speak English, and is appointed to act as interpreter and spokesman. The purpose of the visit has been stated in telegraphic despatches, but some fuller information is now available. It seems that the relations of Great Britain towards Ashanti have, with the sanction of the French Government, assumed somewhat new features, as it has been recognised as falling within the British sphere of influence. With the increased assurance of protection thus afforded, British traders have extended their operations in the country, which is extremely fertile in general produce, and especially rich in gold. The Governor of Cape Coast Castle, Sir W. Brandford Griffith, has consequently been led to propose the extension of British authority in a more formal manner—the establishment of a British Resident at the capital, Coomassie (or Kumasi). This step having been taken, the next would naturally be the definite conversion of the country into a British Protectorate. But to this idea a considerable number of the Natives have expressed the most decided objection; and it is with the idea of expressing the popular feeling upon this point that these six ""ambassadors"" have been appointed with the intention that they should seek an interview with the Queen, and lay before her Majesty the reasons why such a course would be so unpopular among their people.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-05-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_05_1895#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'How to Treat Dahomey', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""We observe by our English journals, received per Ethiope, that the friends of Africa in England are greatly bestirring themselves in favour of our country.

It has therefore, we think, become imperative on Great Britain not only to demand the full payment of the fine justly imposed by Sir William Hewett, but to insist also on such other conditions as the legitimate interests of the neighbouring British settlements may seem to require. We were, therefore, glad to see, and we congratulate Sir William Hewett, that there was so strong an expression on both sides in the House of Lords that there could not be any withdrawal of our just demands; and that if his Majesty of Dahomey continue intractable, effective measures should be adopted. Some sort of apprehension has been felt that should it become necessary to proceed to extremities with King Gelélé, there would be something like a renewal of preparations such as preceded the march of our soldiers to Coomassie. But this is a mistake. Abomey is much more easy of access from the coast than is Coomassie. Instead of being 190 miles from Whydah, or from Porto Novo, as Coomassie is from Cape Coast Castle, Abomey, the capital of Dahomey—where the King usually resides, and where the sacrificial atrocities are committed—is not much, if any, more than ninety miles from Whydah or Porto Novo. Unlike Ashanti, which is so densely wooded, Dahomey is, for the most part, an open country; while the roads for many miles around Abomey are broad and good—have been represented, indeed, by European visitors as fully equal to the best English high roads. There is only one difficulty, in the shape of a swamp, through which the paths are narrow, and which is almost impassable during the rainy season; but any advance into the interior on our part would not be made during that season, and the swamp, we believe, may be turned, without any great increase of distance to be traversed. As regards forces, those of Dahomey are not fit in any way to be put in comparison with those of Ashanti which were encountered during the march on Coomassie. With the exception of his Amazons, the King of Dahomey has very few dependable troops, while neither Amazons nor the others are fit to stand five minutes against the well-trained Houssas which we could now send against them, to say nothing of the few hundred blue jackets that the Fleet would furnish. Like the Ashantees, the Dahomans have neither artillery nor rocket tubes, and could not at all contend with such formidable weapons. Our own impression is that in the event of an advance on Abomey, there would be very little bloodshed. With the exception of those who constitute the armed force of Dahomey, the country groans under a tyranny from which it would gladly embrace an opportunity to escape. The Dahomans proper conquered the territories over which they now tyrannize; and the heavy blood tribute they have demanded from the people, with other exactions of the most galling nature, especially those connected with the formation and maintenance of the privileged Amazon corps, has prevented the growth of any real attachment between the governing power and its subjects; and it would not in any way surprise us should the advance of British forces on Abomey, with one defeat of the King's army, be the signal for a general rising of the agricultural population, to wreak their just vengeance on oppressors whose sins against humanity have been of so deep a dye. By the order published in the Gazette of the 23rd May, the blockade of the Dahoman ports by Her Majesty's ships, under the command of Sir William Hewett, will commence on the 1st of July, should the fine imposed by the Commodore not be previously paid. We do not think that the extension of time for payment (the blockade was to have begun on the 1st of June) will bring any additional advantages to the King. There is time, it is true, for the steamer which left Liverpool on Saturday last to land cargo at Whydah, and the other ports mentioned in the Government notice, before the blockade will commence. Merchants, however, we should think—even including Messrs. Regis, of Marseilles—will be more anxious about the safety or safe removal of property they may now have on shore there than to incur the risk of increasing their ventures within the Dahoman territory. We approve, therefore, on every ground of the extension of time thus accorded. It may save the property of British merchants by giving them longer time for its sale or removal; it gives the King longer opportunity for reflection, which, however, as we have above said, we hope he will not be wise enough to turn to good account for his own safety; while, if ulterior measures become necessary, it will enable all requisite arrangements to be made, so that everything shall be in readiness in October, when the rains will have ceased, and the country have pretty well recovered from their effects so far as regards its condition to be traversed by an armed force. We shall now wait the arrival of successive steamers from the Coast with greatly increased interest, but at the same time with a feeling of certainty that whatever may be the course pursued by the King, the blockading squadron, or a subsequent expedition, the ultimate result of the present difficulty will be the creation of additional facilities for the spread of Christian civilization within territories where the blackest rites of the most blood-thirsty of superstitions have been hitherto practised without intermission, hindrance, or remorse."", 'last_edit_date': '1876-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1876#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'DAHOMEY: ITS KING AND PEOPLE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The King of Dahomey has not realized the expectations we last month hazarded respecting him. Those expectations were formed on the supposition that he might possess some few grains of common sense, which would place vividly before his mental vision the dangers of collision between an earthen pot and a sledge hammer wielded by an arm of power. It seems to be now past dispute that, instead of disowning the acts of the brutal authorities at Whydah, who showed themselves to be fit servants to such a master, he has put a bold front on the matter, and sent the insolent message that ""he will pay the Commodore in powder and bullets if he will come up to Abomey."" This is the language that might be expected only from a doomed idiot, vapouring among the spiritless slaves by whom he may be surrounded, and who have worshipped him as almost a god, until he believes himself to be quite one. It is clearly full time that both King and people should be undeceived by coming in rude contact with something more than a few European trading clerks and agents, who, naturally enough, in the interests of their trade, submit, uncomplainingly, to everything short of actual plunder and brutal violence. Our opinions and feelings respecting the frantic iniquity of Dahomey are so strong, and our conviction that it is the imperative duty of Great Britain, as the real protecting Power on the West Coast of Africa, to put a final end to its enormities as being a daily insult to humanity, is so unalterable, that all we can say in reply to the braggart King is that we hope he will continue in his present frame of mind, and not be moved to feigned repentance by the blockade of his sea-ports. We do not wish him to repent, and thus save himself and his authority from destruction—unless his repentance should go so far (which it never would do) as to secure his faithful acquiescence in British demands, that he should never henceforth make any inroads into Egba territories in search of victims for his atrocious festivals, and that those festivals of blood should be entirely put an end to. The earth has groaned long enough under this blood-thirsty monster, and the devilish system that he at this time represents. That system is incurable by any other means than the entire destruction of the Power with which it is identified, and of which it is an inseparable part. The late King, and the present also, more than once declared to Europeans who have been on missions to Abomey, that even were he desirous of doing so, he could not discontinue that perpetual series of human sacrifices in which his people delight; that his prestige would be gone, and that he in his turn would be a victim if he ceased to justify by deeds his title of ""Man-slayer."" There is possibly truth in this. The people, like their King, are accustomed to sniff the, to them, intoxicating odour of the reeking blood of victims slaughtered before their eyes, and would object to be deprived of a gratification they have so long enjoyed. Under such circumstances there is only one way of purifying the horribly polluted atmosphere of Dahomey, and that is by bringing a superior force to bear upon King, people, and institutions. As already stated, we have ourselves always held the opinion that it was the duty of a civilized Christian Power such as Great Britain to interfere in the interests of humanity. There are now other interests, in addition to those of mere humanity, urging and impelling to the work. Not only has one of her subjects been grievously maltreated, but the financial interests of the Gold Coast Colony are very prejudicially interfered with by the action of Dahomey as a marauding State. The yearly armed expeditions into the Egba territories, even up to the immediate neighbourhood of Abeokuta, in quest of plunder and victims for sacrifice in the ""Customs,"" inflict very great injury not only on the industrious Egba agriculturists, but also, as a necessary result, on the revenues of Lagos. There is an annual scare in the Egba territories. Farms are deserted, the people take refuge in Abeokuta, and their property is wasted and destroyed. We feel sure that we do not exaggerate when we say that were those marauding inroads to cease, and to cease at the absurd certainty that there will not be any renewal of them, agricultural industry will take so great a development in the Egba countries that the production would be doubled, with corresponding advantage to the', 'last_edit_date': '1876-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1876#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'lightly undertaken.

The King of Dahomey, on a certain occasion, expressed a curiosity to ascertain the exact appearance presented by an infant whilst in the womb, and in order to gratify that diabolical curiosity, this religious monarch ordered one of his female subjects who was in an advanced state of pregnancy to be brought before him. I cannot write what followed, as it would be too disgusting; but suffice it to say, that the King, having satisfied his curiosity, exclaimed, ""Is that all?"" There are those still living that can corroborate this.

It was so vague and ambiguous that it was interpreted by both parties as each saw fit. The treaty granted France the right to 'represent Madagascar in all its foreign relations' and to maintain a resident-general with a military escort at Antananarivo. It granted French nationals the right to obtain long-term leases of up to ninety-nine years and the French navy the right to occupy Diego Suarez, while the French government was awarded an indemnity of ten million francs. This treaty, in which there is no mention of the word 'protectorate', recognized Queen Ranavalona as sovereign of the entire island and as sole owner of land. The 'Appendix' or explanatory letter which the prime minister demanded and secured from the French negotiators on 9 January 1886, before agreeing to ratify the treaty, laid down the powers of the resident-general, fixed the size of his military escort at fifty men, and described the limits of the territory of Diego Suarez as being one nautical mile to the south and west and four miles to the north. These terms were meant to limit the scope of the treaty. The French administration, on the other hand, attached no significance to the 'Appendix' and interpreted the agreement concluded on 17 December 1885 as being a protectorate treaty. By contrast, the Malagasy government, which was dominated by Rainilaiarivony, refused to consider the document as a treaty establishing a protectorate over the island and put forward a quite different interpretation of the document, in opposition to the French schemes. This interpretation was based on constant references to the 'Appendix', which had limited the scope of the clauses that were regarded as being prejudicial to the independence of the kingdom. The rulers in Antananarivo accordingly attempted to prevent the protectorate from coming into being by playing on the differences between the French and the Malagasy texts and the clarifications spelt out in the additional protocol. 10 Thus, a war of attrition came to be waged between the prime minister and successive residents-general as misunderstandings continued to multiply.

French Catholic missionaries in Madagascar, for their part, were reduced to evangelizing the lower social classes since most of the noble families and the rich and powerful commoners had been converted to Protestantism. Consequently they demanded official support from France in their bid to overcome the competition of the Protestants, whom they portrayed as being a product of the innumerable 'underhand dealings' of the British. This 'perfidious Albion' theory found a favourable echo in certain business circles which, in an endeavour to conquer the Malagasy market at the expense of the British and Americans, sought to debar the latter by annexing the island rather than by reducing the prices of their own goods. Colonial propaganda appealed to people's chauvinistic sentiments and the belief in France's humanitarian and civilizing mission. In order to prime public opinion for the conquest, th*; 'Kingdom of Madagascar' was presented, in blatant bad faith, as being a 'barbarous state', headed by a 'foreign tribe' which had exalted 'tyranny as a system of government' and still engaged in the slave trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.727, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Madagascar, 1880S-1930S: African initiatives and reaction to colonial conquest and domination', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The Anglo-Merina Treaty,$^{1}$ which was signed on 23 October 1817 and ratified in 1820, conferred on Radama I the title of'King of Madagascar' and on 14 February 1822 he went on to proclaim his sovereignty over the entire island (see Fig. 10.1).

This liberal attitude goes to show the separation that existed between the churches and the state, even though 'around the chapel in the queen's palace, the Prime Minister may have tried to form a national Church, the Palace Church, composed of Malagasy churchmen and evangelists in his service'. 5 These attempts gave rise to lingering fears among the Jesuits and to an 'incorrigible mistrust' among the representatives of the London Missionary Society (LMS).\nIn 1877, the royal government freed the Masombika slaves imported from the African mainland and arranged for them to be settled on lands allocated to them. In 1878, it recast the legal system, which was henceforward entrusted to three courts whose task it was to conduct investigations, while decision-making lay with the prime minister.

The Queen and the Andafiavaratra clan in particular and the oligarchy in general could adopt this attitude of resistance to foreigners because, despite sporadic revolts, they were in control ofthe most important provinces, whose economy they controlled, including a monopoly on the beef trade. In this lies their determination to continue to promote Western education and establish industries to produce those goods which they needed but which could not now be imported from outside. In maintaining commercial contacts with the outside world, the Queen used the services of a French national called de Lastelle, who was established at Tamatave, and an American national called William Marks at Majunga. With the support of de Lastelle, sugar plantations were established on the eastern coast, and a factory was installed at Mahela producing sugar and rum.31 The Queen engaged Jean Laborde, a French adventurer, who arrived in Antananarivo in 1832 'as a kind of general superintendent of works'. He first established a factory at Ilafy, 10 km north of Antananarivo before moving to Mantasoa, on the edge of the eastern forest in a region rich in running water but where it was difficult to get the Malagasy to work willingly. At Mantasoa, with official backing, he established an industrial complex employing some 20000 workers. This produced various goods ranging from guns and cannon to glass and soap. Perhaps Laborde's greatest and most lasting creation was the wooden palace of the Queen, later enclosed in stone by Cameron, which now dominates Antananarivo. De Lastelle and Laborde became Malagasy citizens and were incorporated into the ruling oligarchy. 32 Queen Ranavalona continued the expansion which Radama I had begun and consolidated her administration in the conquered territories. The equipment of her army necessitated the prosecution of external trade to obtain ammunition and the encouragement of gun production at Laborde's factory. She levied special taxes for the support of the wars. The town of Fianarantsoa was created in 1831 as a regional capital, and the province of Betsileo was reorganized. From Fianarantsoa expeditions were dispatched in the 1830s to the south, some of which, under the command of Rainiharo, crossed the Bara, the Mahafaly and the Masikoro countries.

Moreover, Madagascar was important for political and strategic considerations. In particular, the British wanted to secure the support of the ruler for the abolition of the slave trade, since Madagascar was one of the main sources of slaves in the region. It was Sir Robert's desire, therefore, to pursue an active political role in Madagascar. This policy, coinciding as it did with Radama's own determination to expand to the east, was to have, as one writer has put it, 'important consequences for the future of Madagascar'. 12 After several friendly contacts, Farquhar sent a diplomatic mission, led by Captain Le Sage, which arrived in Antananarivo on 21 December 1816. A treaty of friendship and commerce was eventually signed on 4 February 1817 between Radama and Le Sage. But this treaty did not satisfy the Mauritian Governor because it did not mention the slave trade, a matter of considerable importance to Sir Robert. The Governor therefore sent another mission to Radama's capital, this time led by James Hastie, a former Sergeant at Arms in India and more experienced in handling negotiations with oriental rulers.$^{13}$ Hastie brought along with him a number of gifts for the king, including horses, a compass, a map of the world and a chiming clock, all of which greatly impressed the young king and helped Hastie to win his love and confidence. The negotiations, however, stumbled over the British insistence that Radama should outlaw the slave trade in Madagascar. When Radama argued that by doing this he would be com› mitting economic suicide because the slave trade was the major source of his revenue, Hastie had a ready answer: the British would pay the Malagasy ruler an annual sum of 1000 dollars in gold, 1000 dollars in silver, a hundred barrels of gunpowder, 100 English muskets with 100 flints, 400 soldiers' uniforms, 12 sergeants' swords, 600 pieces of cloth, a full-dress uniform for himself and 2 horses as compensation.$^{14}$ Radama considered that he had made a fair deal, especially since the treaty also recognized him as king of the whole of Madagascar. The Anglo-Malagasy Treaty of Friendship and Commerce was signed at Tamatave on 23 October 1817. James Hastie, the successful negotiator, was dispatched to Madagascar again in 1820 to act as the British Resident in the Malagasy capital."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 57, 'article_title': 'MADAGASCAR', 'full_section_title': 'MADAGASCAR', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1862#article-11', 'issue_date': '23_12_1862', 'content': 'King Radama II. has been crowned at his capital of Antananarivo.

A more shameful story of arrogance and high-handed wrong-doing on the part of a first-rate European Power has been seldom given to the world. The first dispute, it seems, arose over the sale of land by the heirs of a former French Consul to a Roman Catholic priest. The Hova Government objected to the sale because the Consul in question, by Malagasy law, which prohibits the owning of land by foreigners, was only a life tenant. Moreover, the title-deeds which the Hova Government declare to have been forged, bore the signature of King Radama II., dated several months after that monarch\'s death. The French Consul attempted to explain this unpleasant fact away by different reckonings of the calendar, but the Hovas are able to prove that not a single document of Radama II.\'s reign bears the date of 1864 except the particular one in dispute. The second dispute arose over the death of four French sailors on the coast. These men were, from the Malagasy standpoint, nothing more nor less than smugglers, who were landing weapons of war and ammunition, contrary to treaty. A Malagasy chief endeavoured to stop this traffic, and was fired upon by the French smugglers, whereupon the fire was returned, with the result that four of the French were killed and the goods in question seized. In the end the Hova Government paid an indemnity under protest. The trumped-up claim of the French to a Protectorate over the North-west Coast rests upon an alleged transfer of power by a certain chief to the French; but, apart from the fact that this man, as a vassal, had no right to alienate lands, the treaty which he did sign only allowed the French to settle for agricultural and commercial purposes, and to keep some armed men ""for their own protection."" We regret to find that the tone of the French officials throughout the controversy is to the last degree insolent and provocative. They appear to have acted upon the principle that weak nations have no rights which France is bound to respect; and that every Frenchman who finds himself in the territory of such a nation has a right to whatever he pleases, no matter what may be the law of the country. It is this kind of treatment of other nations which has more than once drawn down upon France evils and troubles which have shaken the whole commonwealth to its very centre. But we trust the French Ministry will not fail to put an explanation before the world which is worthy of the high position France holds in the front ranks of civilization.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1884#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MADAGASCAR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Advices received in Paris from Tamatave, dated May 19, state that as soon as the bombardment of Majunga became known, a certain agitation manifested itself among the Hovas.

That Great Britain had never yielded to the temptation to take possession of that magnificent island when there were none to oppose her in so doing, was a reason why France should not attempt to disturb existing international understandings with regard to it and other independent native African territories. But now a thirst for colonial aggrandisement has clearly taken possession of the French official mind. The Republic must have its glories somewhere. Where? Let her get them on the side of Tonquin, and of Africa. And we do not see that Great Britain can justly take exception to this. She has had her day of conquests and annexations, and why should it follow that because she is sated and ""cares"" now ""for none of these things,"" therefore no such aspirations as those in which she formerly indulged shall be cherished by France or any other European nation? If to conquer and colonize be a sin on the part of France, it is certainly not Britain that should cast the first stone. We may be grieved; there has been a feeling of great interest created in England on behalf of Madagascar, where it has been believed that something like an enlightened and Christian native Government had been established; and there will also be some serious injury sustained by some portion of Her Majesty\'s colonial possessions by Madagascar being shut up against the rest of the world by the jealous French colonial rule and regulations as regards trade. But this cannot be avoided if the French do take possession. Earl Granville has, we are convinced, done all that could possibly be done on behalf of the Madagascar people and Government; but as we have not any territorial rights in Madagascar, having always refrained from acquiring any, so that we might not tempt others to go in also, it seems to us that we cannot do anything but acquiesce should Madagascar be made a French colonial possession. We may nationally as well as individually sympathize and feel deeply, and we do sympathize and feel deeply; but there is a wide gulf between this and going to war with the object of maintaining the independence of Madagascar. If France fancies she has need of the island, and believes that she has a pretext that justifies her in her own eyes in taking possession of it, we do not see how she can be prevented having it. And any armed resistance on the part of the Hovas should be deprecated rather than encouraged by any portion of the British Press or people, because it is absurd to suppose that a nation like France, once embarked on the enterprise of subjugating Madagascar, would desist until she had fully effected her object. In our view, however, there is more than the subjugation of Madagascar at issue in this matter. It is the demand there will be, on the part of French planters and colonists, for negro labour that fills us with apprehension that there will be a great renewal of the foreign slave-trade from East Africa, under the name, perhaps, of free apprenticeships, but in reality bondage, with all its cruelties. This action, moreover, on the part of France may open a new era of European enterprise (not British) to take possession of what are looked upon as, and for the most part are, the hitherto unannexed uncivilized portions of the earth. We have not always agreed with the modern determination of Great Britain against annexing territories the inhabitants of which are uncivilized, and who would fall a ready prey to adventurers from other European countries. Not because we have any land greed, but because, with all its faults, British Crown government has done more than would have been done by any other government for the spread of civilization, while energetic British Missionary Societies never fail to send the message of the Gospel of peace and salvation to peoples thus taken under British rule.

Notwithstanding this arrangement, and despite the fact that Madagascar with all its rich resources lies close at hand, France has still to grant 62,000 dols. a year, and tax every inhabitant to the amount of five dols. a head, before the colony can be kept up; simply because there are no colonists there, but merely worrying officials. Yet in the face of these facts, the Republic wishes to enlarge her possessions in Madagascar. The prospects of the island as a French colony, judging from the doings in Tamatave during the past year, are far from encouraging. Already a protection duty has been put on American imports, and trade has been driven to other parts of the island. With such facts as these to guide them, Mauritian colonists ought to be able to foresee the effects of a French possession. Take for instance the innumerable list of towns all down the East Coast. As a rule, we may state that they have been colonized on an average by twenty-five Mauritians and five French citizens of Réunion to each village. Now these five Bourbonnais would be just enough to satisfy the wants of each place. Instead of hawking round red cotton pocket-handkerchiefs, absinthe, and Marseilles pottery, they would immediately be installed as ""Monsieur le Maire,"" ""Monsieur le Chef de Douane,"" ""Monsieur le Juge,"" and the remaining ones could be made secretaries and chancellors. They close their shops, put some gold lace round their hats, post up a set of painted boards announcing the ""Departement de ceci,"" and ""Departement de cela;"" and then strut about underneath the cocoa-nut trees, take their vermouth at decent intervals, wear a ribbon of the Legion of Honour in their button-holes, and talk loudly about the success of French colonization. Certainly for them there are great benefits, but where are the American merchants? Where are the Mauritians? The twenty-five Mauritians in each village will have to pay taxes sufficient to support their five Bourbonnais officials, whereas formerly these Bourbonnais were very glad to get a few hundred dollars\' credit from some English merchant to go and trade up the river. The imports from France will naturally always include wines and spirits which will enter free of duty to these sinecure officials, and the Mauritians will probably have to pay for a bottle of claret about three shillings to a dollar, while Mauritius rum, which certainly cannot be called nectar, will probably cost more than French brandy imported from Bordeaux.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1885#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'FRANCE AND MADAGASCAR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Marseilles, November 16.\n\nIntelligence received here to-day from Madagascar announces that the Hovas persisted in requiring the French commandant to give up the treaty concluded with M.

The French planters of a neighbouring island covet Madagascar, and from an impulse given by them, the French Government has commenced operations which have every probability of being continued until Madagascar becomes a French colonial possession. The various items of intelligence which we publish in other columns, giving brief accounts of the preliminary operations of the French Naval Commander, suffice to justify the belief that the French Government have decided on the conquest of Madagascar. That in this they should have departed from certain arrangements long since made by it with that of Great Britain, will not, we think, save Madagascar from annexation to the colonial possessions of France. And what an addition to those possessions, if acquired! An island 1,000 miles in length, by an average breadth of 240 miles, and containing 240,000 square miles of surface. It must be owned that ""the game is worth the candle,"" if there be a possibility of acquiring this rich territorial gem of the Indian Ocean. And, possibly, there undoubtedly is, if Madagascar be left, as it most probably will be left, to defend itself. To the planters of Réunion, from which it is distant only 150 miles, it is a tempting acquisition; not the less tempting that it is also only 100 miles from Mozambique, on the East coast of Africa, so long notorious for the African foreign slave-trade carried on there. For, as we stated when the French claims upon Madagascar were first put forward, it would be absurd to attempt to shut our eyes to the fact that there was an intimate connection between the prohibition by the British Indian Government of any further supply of coolie labour to Réunion, and the putting forward of those claims. What those planters desire is evidently a supply of labourers whom they may ""use up"" at pleasure in the old Cuban fashion. If they would have given decent, humane treatment to the Indian coolies, there was in our East Indian possessions an inexhaustible field of supply. But the British Government which exacts from the planters in its own island, the Mauritius, guarantees for the good treatment and freedom of their coolie labourers—guarantees which were for a long time very unpalatable to them—could not possibly permit the continued subjection of any portion of its Indian subjects to the barbarities of Réunion. Seeing, then, the primary object with which the war by France upon Madagascar has been undertaken, we are compelled to classify it as an iniquitous war—a war fraught with evils of no slight nature, both to the natives of Madagascar itself and to the East coast and Eastern countries of Africa, where we may expect to see a considerable increase of that infamous, inhuman, devastating slave-traffic, the denunciation and exposure of which by the lamented Dr. Livingstone are familiar to our readers. Yes; in its inception this French war on Madagascar is a war for the extension of a negro slave-trade, and, therefore, unworthy of the French Republic. We say, in its inception; because there can be no doubt that the French Government and people will indignantly deny that they are actuated by any such motive. And we believe them. The Réunion wire-pullers have kept their machinery out of sight, merely bringing forward supposed French claims upon a portion of the Island, which their agents no doubt represented to the French Government would, after a little difficulty on the part of the Hovas Government, be admitted, if properly pressed; well knowing that when a Government such as that of France puts forth claims, whether just or unjust, with an expressed determination to enforce them, there can be but one result where the antagonist is a weak and only partially semi-civilized state. And this ""urging"" on the part of the Réunion interests has, unhappily for Madagascar, happened at a time when an idea of greatly extending its colonial dominions had taken possession of the French mind. The dominance of that idea is manifest by the determination to annex Tonquin and Annam; in its approval of, and subvention to, the De Brazza Congo territory expedition; in its resumed protectorate over Porto Novo, for which the old Régis influence seems to have been at work. Now, like all our brethren of the British daily press, we have no objection to a great extension of French colonial dominion, provided the efforts to accomplish it do not strike at the roots of objects, convictions, and interests of international importance and of long-pursued efforts for the spread of civilization and the removal of sanguinary barbarisms. But this war upon Madagascar does strike at the root of convictions and objects very dear to the people of Great Britain, and recognized as just and holy by all civilized Governments, having acquired thereby a general international sanction. France cannot succeed in that war without giving a renewed impetus to a traffic in negro slaves. We have said that probably she will succeed in subjugating the Island if she persist, although the history of European attempts upon portions of it points to difficulties of a very serious nature. We are putting altogether out of question any supposition that the British Government will put forward claims founded upon the proclamation of sovereignty over the Island by Sir Robert Farquhar in 1816, which have been virtually in abeyance, at least, by the acknowledgment of and support given to successive Hovas sovereigns. But let us suppose that no such European intervention stands between France and her projected conquest. Here is a tropical island, 1,000 miles long by 240 wide, with a population estimated at 5,000,000, all speaking the same language, though with great difference of origin and physical and mental characteristics. The question first resolves itself into this: Are these people jealous of, and will they struggle heartily and persistently against foreign domination? Nothing is to be inferred by way of response to this from the facility with which the French Naval Commander has shelled certain forts or establishments on the coast. The people were not prepared for such an event. Reliance was no doubt placed, in some measure, on what might be effected by the Envoys in Europe, and a declaration of war might possibly have been looked for as a preliminary. Here is an island with 2,500 miles of coast. Effectively to blockade this would not be an easy matter.

THE COMMERCIAL OUTLOOK.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Commercially and industrially speaking, the coast of Madagascar may be divided into five great divisions. The first is the long stretch of east coast from Antongil Bay to Fort Dauphin, forming almost a straight line. It contains not a single really good natural harbour, nor a decently navigable river of any length, and most of its towns are only approached by dangerous roadsteads. From its geographical position it will easily be understood that its foreign element are mostly Mauritians. The natural resources of this coast have been to a great extent exhausted, and the prospects now lie principally in sugar-planting. The Mauritians are naturally acquainted with this industry, and there is a great future before them. Coffee is also a profitable undertaking, but it must not be planted at a lower elevation than 1,500 feet above the level of the sea. Spices of almost every kind can also be cultivated auxiliary to the sugar plantations. The second division is that called the North-east Coast, being that part between Antongil Bay and Cape Amber. It contains two or three harbours, but not very good ones. The forests here are much larger than in any other part, and consequently the natural supplies of India-rubber and gum-copal are still plentiful. This is the most thinly populated part of the island, but exceedingly fertile. Probably in a few more years the natural resources will be exhausted, and foreign residents will then have recourse to agriculture, with better results perhaps than can be obtained on any other part of the East Coast. The third division of the Coast is the North-west, from Cape Amber to Cape St. Andrew, and the part coveted by France. This part contains lignite deposits and valuable woods, and is full of good harbours. Its foreign element consists chiefly of Indians and Muslims, and a few French Creoles. The fourth division is the West Coast, properly called—i.e., from Cape St. Andrew North to St. Augustine South. Full of good harbours and navigable rivers, it is probably the finest part of Madagascar. The foreigners there are mostly Americans and Englishmen, who carry on a trade with the Cape and Natal. The fifth part is the Southern portion, from St. Augustine to Fort Dauphin, about which nothing is really known.\n\nIt will be seen, then, how little is yet known of the vast commercial resources of this island, and of the number of industries that may be opened. The trade of the last few months has been characterised by a little more activity, but at best can only be said to be very slack. The coast merchants are still prevented from exporting such articles as would afford supplies to the French armies, or were prevented up to a very short time ago. The wholesale trade in hides at Antananarivo has somewhat revived, but is far from satisfactory. Cottons are still high, and the American merchants are doing nothing.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-04-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1884#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'FRENCH PROTECTORATE OF THE COMORO ISLANDS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We understand that the French Government have established a Protectorate over the Great Comoro Island.

They are situated at the northern entrance of the Mozambique Channel, between the north-west coast of Madagascar and Cape Delgado, the northern limit of the Portuguese possessions and the southern limit of the territory of the Sultan of Zanzibar. The islands are high and mountainous, partly volcanic, and with coasts of coral formation; and they are distinguished for the fertility of their soil and a climate made temperate by sea breezes. The vegetation has a tropical character, but includes excellent timber for ship-building. Rice and maize grow there, and yams, bananas, and mangos, as well as oranges, lemons, cotton, wild indigo, and the sugar-cane. An important feature is the abundance of tortoises. Large numbers of cattle and sheep are also produced in the islands. The natives are a mixed race of East African Swahili negroes, Arabs, and Malays, professedly Mahometans, but largely given up to fetish worship. They are, however, described as being in general a peaceable and hospitable people. They live mainly by agriculture, but are skilled in the production of textiles.\n\nfabrics and weapons, and in metal and jewellery work. The chief articles of export are palm oil and tortoiseshell.

174,"Napoleon III was expected to honor an understanding with England, which respected Madagascar's independence and was supported by the British public, valuing its strategic importance and progress.","The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide insights into the claim regarding Napoleon III's expected understanding with England to respect Madagascar's independence. The textbook notes that Napoleon III's government signed a treaty with Radama II in 1862, recognizing him as king of Madagascar, which was perceived by the Malagasy as a validation of their kingdom's existence and a retreat from France's territorial ambitions. This aligns with the claim of respecting Madagascar's sovereignty. However, the textbook also highlights France's reluctance to fully accept the abrogation of the 1862 treaty and the Lambert Charter after Radama II's overthrow, indicating a tension between respecting Madagascar's independence and France's interests. Meanwhile, the British government's friendly stance, as evidenced by the Anglo-Malagasy treaty of 1865, underscores Britain's strategic interest in Madagascar, particularly concerning the abolition of the slave trade. The African Times articles further support the claim by expressing hope that Napoleon III would adhere to the understanding with England, emphasizing Madagascar's strategic importance, especially the Bay of Diego Suarez, and the potential negative consequences of foreign occupation.

It granted French nationals the right to obtain long-term leases of up to ninety-nine years and the French navy the right to occupy Diego Suarez, while the French government was awarded an indemnity of ten million francs.

These terms were meant to limit the scope of the treaty. The French administration, on the other hand, attached no significance to the 'Appendix' and interpreted the agreement concluded on 17 December 1885 as being a protectorate treaty. By contrast, the Malagasy government, which was dominated by Rainilaiarivony, refused to consider the document as a treaty establishing a protectorate over the island and put forward a quite different interpretation of the document, in opposition to the French schemes. This interpretation was based on constant references to the 'Appendix', which had limited the scope of the clauses that were regarded as being prejudicial to the independence of the kingdom. The rulers in Antananarivo accordingly attempted to prevent the protectorate from coming into being by playing on the differences between the French and the Malagasy texts and the clarifications spelt out in the additional protocol. 10 Thus, a war of attrition came to be waged between the prime minister and successive residents-general as misunderstandings continued to multiply.

The Catholics were very active in the Betsileo country and among the subject peoples, who developed a kind of people's Christianity alongside the official religion.

Through men such as James Cameron, the LMS had given a great deal of technical assistance to the Malagasy, and Rainilaiarivony and his colleagues believed that by embracing the LMS's brand of Christianity they would further cement this friendship. In fact, by embracing Protestantism they would draw closer to Britain as allies who could be expected to take their side should difficulties occur again with the French.

It was Sir Robert's desire, therefore, to pursue an active political role in Madagascar. This policy, coinciding as it did with Radama's own determination to expand to the east, was to have, as one writer has put it, 'important consequences for the future of Madagascar'. 12 After several friendly contacts, Farquhar sent a diplomatic mission, led by Captain Le Sage, which arrived in Antananarivo on 21 December 1816. A treaty of friendship and commerce was eventually signed on 4 February 1817 between Radama and Le Sage.

That claim, which had its roots in the memory of the annexation proclaimed under Louis XIV and of the fruitless attempts made in the eighteenth century to set up a prosperous France Orientale, based on the trading posts established in the eighteenth century and under the Restoration, was developed throughout the nineteenth century in a large number of written documents before being put to the French parliament officially in 1884.

This led to the breakdown of relations between the British and the Merina court, and allowed the French to retain a foothold in the Merina capital during a period of British dominance.$^{15}$ Radama was clearly upset by the British failure to fulfil the terms of the 1817 Treaty, but he was soon persuaded to forget the past in order to pursue his long-term interests, which he saw clearly as resting on the alliance between his country and Britain. He therefore accepted Hastie's apologies for the mistakes of Hall (who was recalled) and he accordingly renewed the treaty on 11 October 1820.

The events of 19 May 1929 represented both the culmination of the struggle for equality and the starting-point of the demands for independence. They also marked the beginning of authentic political militancy, in the shape of propaganda campaigns, the creation of political cells and parties, and the emergence of a broad-based and varied press. Ralaimongo, who had been exiled to Port Berge, encouraged the peasants to engage in the type of resistance practised by Gandhi in India. In 1931, he openly mooted the idea of independence in response to a speech by Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Colonies, which rejected the case for wholesale naturalization. In L'Opinion of 20 July 1934, Ravoahangy evoked 'the natural and inalienable right to form a free and independent nation'. From 1935 onwards, other newspapers that were openly nationalistic in outlook began to appear. Both Ny Fierenena malagasy ('The Malagasy Nation') and Ny Rariny ('Justice') constantly urged that Madagascar must become free. The movement was losing momentum, however. In fact, 'the business community had been hard-hit by the economic crisis and withdrew its support... Civil servants were afraid of compromising themselves and of losing their jobs. The Protestant ministers were embarrassed at the political turn taken by developments and retreated into their churches.

It is not generally known that the population of Madagascar is estimated to be some five millions; and if, as is strongly asserted by those who have had an intimate acquaintance with the Hova Government and people, these will fight to the last extremity for their independence, the subjugation of five millions, in a tropical country, furnished as they no doubt will be with arms and ammunition from Europe and America, will not be a mere military promenade. We prefer not entering more fully on this subject, until detailed accounts of the late French operations arrive. We may, however, state our opinion that in thus attacking the dominion of a settled Government (although a black one) the French cannot expect any of that sympathy which might be accorded to an endeavour to convert some altogether barbarian country into a French colony.

A Christian officer was at Tamatave to meet him, and conduct him, in the King's name, to Antananarivo. He was exceedingly well received. When the Protestant places of worship were opened, there was great astonishment at the number of Christians who presented themselves after their long concealment under most dreadful persecutions.\n\nBy last advices three Roman Catholic priests and four sisters of charity were likewise there; and six priests, with four lay assistants, left Aden in the steamer, on Dec. 12, to reinforce the mission.\n\nThe report made to the Governor of Mauritius by the embassy he sent to the new King of Madagascar is very interesting and important. We will preface a few extracts by one from the instructions given by the Governor to the embassy:—\n\nI may here repeat what I have already amply explained, that there is a clear understanding between the English and the French Governments, that no diplomatic step whatever, that may alter the present relations and state of things with Madagascar, is to be taken by either of these countries, without the full knowledge and consent of the other. With this fact in mind, all approach, or appearance of approach, to that point must be carefully avoided, in act and word, by all members of this mission.\n\nThe following from the report seems to dispose of the falsehoods of the French press about Prime Minister Lambert:—\n\nAlthough there is every disposition on the part of the King and his Government to welcome Europeans, and treat them with respect and kindness, there is yet no truth in the report that the King has sought their official counsel, and has appointed one among the European residents to fill an important executive office. Such a step would be entirely opposed to the spirit of the Madagascar Government.\n\nIn reference to the general joy manifested at the presence of the English, it says:—\n\nWe need not look for an explanation of this feeling. The missionary work, initiated thirty years ago, will sufficiently account for it. Nearly all the arts with which the people are acquainted were taught them by the missionaries, and your excellency will see with astonishment with what patience their workmen carry out any given task, and often with implements ill fitted for the performance of it.

(Hear, hear.) Now, I think the serious attention of this country was attracted to Madagascar in 1817, when a slave-trade treaty was agreed to by Radama, the King of the Hovas, under certain conditions. I do not think this is the moment to trouble you with any detailed history of all the different incidents regarding France, regarding Madagascar, and regarding ourselves in the years which have elapsed. All I will say is this—that on some occasions France and England have absolutely acted together; and I am not aware of there having been any exceptions to the friendly character of the communications which have taken place between the two countries. In 1850 Lord Palmerston recognized the right of the French to the possession of Nosébé. In 1853 and 1854 there were discussions between the two Governments which resulted in the understanding that neither would take action with regard to Madagascar without previous consultation with the other. (Cheers.) Later on, I think, this understanding was recognized. In 1858, 1859, 1862, and 1863, most conciliatory assurances were given. Now, there is no doubt that for some years past the relations between France and Madagascar have been extremely strained. I really cannot speak with absolute official knowledge on the subject, but what I have gathered from communications with Lord Lyons, from consular reports, and from other sources, is that the points in dispute between France and Madagascar at this moment are three. First of all, there are the claims of individual French subjects; then there is the claim of France that Frenchmen should be allowed to purchase, and to hold permanently, land in the island; and, thirdly, there is the claim of France to a protectorate over a considerable portion of the main land. Now, it would be impossible for me off-hand, even if it were desirable, to give any opinion with regard to the claims of individual French subjects against the Madagascar Government. With regard to the claim that Madagascar should allow foreigners to purchase land in the island, I may say the Madagascar Government have consistently maintained that their municipal law made it impossible that such purchases should take place or should be valid. But, on the other hand, both France and England—although France has at-ik it more pertinaciously than we have—have contended that they have treaty rights which give a claim to French and English subjects both to purchase land and to hold it. With regard to a French protectorate over a great portion of the island, all I can say is that, as at present advised, I am not aware of any treaty which gives such a right to France. (Cheers.) You are aware that for some weeks past there has been an Embassy at Paris from Madagascar; and it is also a fact that that Embassy seems to have come to a sudden end, and the Ambassadors have arrived in this country. Although I have had no communication from them up to this moment, I am told, but do not as yet know it to be a fact, that they are officially accredited to her Majesty. Of course, upon whether they be so or not will depend my receiving the Embassy officially or as private individuals who wish to communicate with me on this subject. I venture to think that, considering the composition of this deputation; it will be easily understood by you, gentlemen, that I am only performing a strict act of duty if I abstain from saying one single word that can be strained into the slightest discourtesy to the French Government. I think, also, that it will be equally admitted that I have no right to say anything that would commit her Majesty\'s Government to any particular course—(hear, hear)—or to say anything that would restrain us in our perfect liberty of action. (Hear, hear.) Understanding that that is the view of the deputation, I do most heartily thank you for having come here, and for the very considerate manner in which you have stated the case which it is evident you have so much at heart.""

That Great Britain had never yielded to the temptation to take possession of that magnificent island when there were none to oppose her in so doing, was a reason why France should not attempt to disturb existing international understandings with regard to it and other independent native African territories. But now a thirst for colonial aggrandisement has clearly taken possession of the French official mind. The Republic must have its glories somewhere. Where? Let her get them on the side of Tonquin, and of Africa. And we do not see that Great Britain can justly take exception to this. She has had her day of conquests and annexations, and why should it follow that because she is sated and ""cares"" now ""for none of these things,"" therefore no such aspirations as those in which she formerly indulged shall be cherished by France or any other European nation? If to conquer and colonize be a sin on the part of France, it is certainly not Britain that should cast the first stone. We may be grieved; there has been a feeling of great interest created in England on behalf of Madagascar, where it has been believed that something like an enlightened and Christian native Government had been established; and there will also be some serious injury sustained by some portion of Her Majesty\'s colonial possessions by Madagascar being shut up against the rest of the world by the jealous French colonial rule and regulations as regards trade. But this cannot be avoided if the French do take possession. Earl Granville has, we are convinced, done all that could possibly be done on behalf of the Madagascar people and Government; but as we have not any territorial rights in Madagascar, having always refrained from acquiring any, so that we might not tempt others to go in also, it seems to us that we cannot do anything but acquiesce should Madagascar be made a French colonial possession. We may nationally as well as individually sympathize and feel deeply, and we do sympathize and feel deeply; but there is a wide gulf between this and going to war with the object of maintaining the independence of Madagascar. If France fancies she has need of the island, and believes that she has a pretext that justifies her in her own eyes in taking possession of it, we do not see how she can be prevented having it. And any armed resistance on the part of the Hovas should be deprecated rather than encouraged by any portion of the British Press or people, because it is absurd to suppose that a nation like France, once embarked on the enterprise of subjugating Madagascar, would desist until she had fully effected her object. In our view, however, there is more than the subjugation of Madagascar at issue in this matter. It is the demand there will be, on the part of French planters and colonists, for negro labour that fills us with apprehension that there will be a great renewal of the foreign slave-trade from East Africa, under the name, perhaps, of free apprenticeships, but in reality bondage, with all its cruelties. This action, moreover, on the part of France may open a new era of European enterprise (not British) to take possession of what are looked upon as, and for the most part are, the hitherto unannexed uncivilized portions of the earth. We have not always agreed with the modern determination of Great Britain against annexing territories the inhabitants of which are uncivilized, and who would fall a ready prey to adventurers from other European countries. Not because we have any land greed, but because, with all its faults, British Crown government has done more than would have been done by any other government for the spread of civilization, while energetic British Missionary Societies never fail to send the message of the Gospel of peace and salvation to peoples thus taken under British rule. There will be trouble on the West Coast of Africa some day through our not having established British rule over the so-called Oil River territories.

An occasional correspondent residing at Antananarivo, has favoured us with a lengthy communication on this subject which, we feel sure will be perused with interest by our readers:—\n\nThe Malagasy nation has spoken. Twenty thousand representatives have declared that Madagascar shall not, without a desperate struggle, be subordinated to French rule. The vast arena of Andohalo—the public meeting-place of Antananarivo—presented the appearance of an amphitheatre. On every side huge multitudes stood, listening to the statement of the Prime Minister that M. Le Myre de Vilers has presented such demands to the Malagasy Government as would, if yielded to, for ever make the Malagasy the dependents of France. ""Has the Government been right in rejecting the demands?"" his Excellency asked, as he finished his speech on the French ultimatum. And in answer to the inquiry, there went up a shout of derision at the French demands. There was no doubt left that ""the heart of a people beat with one desire."" Then the national indignation broke through the desire for peace, and a torrent of eloquence rushed from the mouths of scores of orators. The ""love of peace that was full of wrongs and shames"" was over and done. But there was no wish for war. Only a determination to face that alternative, should France assail the independence of the Malagasy.\n\nWe British dwelling among this people believe that the British Government will not exercise every resource which diplomacy admits to attain a revision of an Anglo-French Convention.\n\nThe Europeans in the interior are pursuing their usual vocations; indeed, there is no need for a feeling of uneasiness.

The French planters of a neighbouring island covet Madagascar, and from an impulse given by them, the French Government has commenced operations which have every probability of being continued until Madagascar becomes a French colonial possession. The various items of intelligence which we publish in other columns, giving brief accounts of the preliminary operations of the French Naval Commander, suffice to justify the belief that the French Government have decided on the conquest of Madagascar. That in this they should have departed from certain arrangements long since made by it with that of Great Britain, will not, we think, save Madagascar from annexation to the colonial possessions of France. And what an addition to those possessions, if acquired! An island 1,000 miles in length, by an average breadth of 240 miles, and containing 240,000 square miles of surface. It must be owned that ""the game is worth the candle,"" if there be a possibility of acquiring this rich territorial gem of the Indian Ocean. And, possibly, there undoubtedly is, if Madagascar be left, as it most probably will be left, to defend itself. To the planters of Réunion, from which it is distant only 150 miles, it is a tempting acquisition; not the less tempting that it is also only 100 miles from Mozambique, on the East coast of Africa, so long notorious for the African foreign slave-trade carried on there. For, as we stated when the French claims upon Madagascar were first put forward, it would be absurd to attempt to shut our eyes to the fact that there was an intimate connection between the prohibition by the British Indian Government of any further supply of coolie labour to Réunion, and the putting forward of those claims. What those planters desire is evidently a supply of labourers whom they may ""use up"" at pleasure in the old Cuban fashion. If they would have given decent, humane treatment to the Indian coolies, there was in our East Indian possessions an inexhaustible field of supply. But the British Government which exacts from the planters in its own island, the Mauritius, guarantees for the good treatment and freedom of their coolie labourers—guarantees which were for a long time very unpalatable to them—could not possibly permit the continued subjection of any portion of its Indian subjects to the barbarities of Réunion. Seeing, then, the primary object with which the war by France upon Madagascar has been undertaken, we are compelled to classify it as an iniquitous war—a war fraught with evils of no slight nature, both to the natives of Madagascar itself and to the East coast and Eastern countries of Africa, where we may expect to see a considerable increase of that infamous, inhuman, devastating slave-traffic, the denunciation and exposure of which by the lamented Dr. Livingstone are familiar to our readers. Yes; in its inception this French war on Madagascar is a war for the extension of a negro slave-trade, and, therefore, unworthy of the French Republic. We say, in its inception; because there can be no doubt that the French Government and people will indignantly deny that they are actuated by any such motive. And we believe them. The Réunion wire-pullers have kept their machinery out of sight, merely bringing forward supposed French claims upon a portion of the Island, which their agents no doubt represented to the French Government would, after a little difficulty on the part of the Hovas Government, be admitted, if properly pressed; well knowing that when a Government such as that of France puts forth claims, whether just or unjust, with an expressed determination to enforce them, there can be but one result where the antagonist is a weak and only partially semi-civilized state. And this ""urging"" on the part of the Réunion interests has, unhappily for Madagascar, happened at a time when an idea of greatly extending its colonial dominions had taken possession of the French mind. The dominance of that idea is manifest by the determination to annex Tonquin and Annam; in its approval of, and subvention to, the De Brazza Congo territory expedition; in its resumed protectorate over Porto Novo, for which the old Régis influence seems to have been at work. Now, like all our brethren of the British daily press, we have no objection to a great extension of French colonial dominion, provided the efforts to accomplish it do not strike at the roots of objects, convictions, and interests of international importance and of long-pursued efforts for the spread of civilization and the removal of sanguinary barbarisms. But this war upon Madagascar does strike at the root of convictions and objects very dear to the people of Great Britain, and recognized as just and holy by all civilized Governments, having acquired thereby a general international sanction. France cannot succeed in that war without giving a renewed impetus to a traffic in negro slaves. We have said that probably she will succeed in subjugating the Island if she persist, although the history of European attempts upon portions of it points to difficulties of a very serious nature. We are putting altogether out of question any supposition that the British Government will put forward claims founded upon the proclamation of sovereignty over the Island by Sir Robert Farquhar in 1816, which have been virtually in abeyance, at least, by the acknowledgment of and support given to successive Hovas sovereigns. But let us suppose that no such European intervention stands between France and her projected conquest. Here is a tropical island, 1,000 miles long by 240 wide, with a population estimated at 5,000,000, all speaking the same language, though with great difference of origin and physical and mental characteristics. The question first resolves itself into this: Are these people jealous of, and will they struggle heartily and persistently against foreign domination? Nothing is to be inferred by way of response to this from the facility with which the French Naval Commander has shelled certain forts or establishments on the coast. The people were not prepared for such an event. Reliance was no doubt placed, in some measure, on what might be effected by the Envoys in Europe, and a declaration of war might possibly have been looked for as a preliminary. Here is an island with 2,500 miles of coast. Effectively to blockade this would not be an easy matter.

Lord E. Fitzmaurice, in reply, said he informed the hon. member on February 18 last that a British man-of-war had been ordered to proceed to the station, and the Consular Staff in Madagascar had been strengthened, in order to afford to British subjects the protection to which they were entitled.\n\n**FRANCE AND MADAGASCAR.**—The close of the debate upon Madagascar in the French Chamber was noticed in our last. Since that date, we learn, on the authority of the Vienna Political Correspondence, that the French Cabinet will not conquer Madagascar, nor evacuate it, nor refer the question to arbitration. The French forces will probably occupy some points in the territory of the friendly tribes, and new colonists will be introduced from Réunion. As regards the future of this question, it is definitely arranged that on the re-opening of the French Chambers in May, the Minister of Marine will ask for a sum of 4,700,000 francs by way of supplies for the Madagascar expedition. In this sum is included the cost of the naval squadron which cruised around Madagascar during the year 1884, and of the reinforced expeditionary corps which is to occupy certain points on the North-west Coast of the island. From this it is evident that no expense will have been spared to render effectual the action of the Republic in that island. There are now eleven French ships of war of different classes cruising in Malagasy waters. The expeditionary force will be increased to nearly 4,000 men, half of whom will be Marines of the infantry and artillery, and half men of the local militia or volunteers from the neighbouring colony of Réunion.\n\n**THE FRENCH EXPEDITION.**—According to the latest statements of the Prime Minister in the French Chamber of Deputies, Admiral Miot will occupy Empassadave, and perhaps Vohemar, or any other points he thinks necessary. There will be no advance into the interior, and, in case of re-opening negotiations, that clause of Admiral Pierre's ultimatum requiring formal recognition of French rights over the island will be waived, it being considered needless to exact a recognition of indisputable rights.

Those who know anything of Madagascar history know the unpronounceable name of Andrianampoinimerina, who held sway from 1787-1810, and who brought much of the island to be subject to the Hova tribe. He had a favourite sister, Rahety by name, and it was at one time thought that her descendants might ultimately obtain the crown; but she gave birth to twins, and had no other issue. For fear, then, that the descendants of these two children should dispute as to their rights to the crown they were both put aside. In course of time one of these lines became extinct. As the late Queen lay on her death bed, very early in the morning of her death, a young girl of about twenty years was awakened out of her sleep in a house about a mile from the palace and taken at once into the presence of the dying Queen, who there and then named her as her successor, and exhorted her in some parting words to trust in the same God as she had trusted in. This young girl, Rajáfindrahety by name, was great-grand-daughter of the Rahety above spoken of. She was well educated in the schools of the Quakers in this city, and latterly in that of the London Missionary Society, and was, I am told, most promising and intelligent. There is another curious thing connected with it. Some three or four years ago she was married to a nephew of the late Queen. Little over two months ago, on May 7, her husband died. If this had not taken place it may be safely said that the girl would never have been Queen. The present Prime Minister would never have suffered any one to be Queen to whom he could not have had access, whether by night or day, and there is no doubt that very soon, even if it has not, as some say, already taken place, he will become the husband of the present Queen, and, unless prevented by the French, become far more powerful than he has ever yet been. Indeed, this is even now evident. For the first time in the history of Madagascar there has been not only no bloodshed, but not even commotion of any kind. The new Queen, under the title of Ranavalona III., has been accepted by the nation as their Sovereign. There is, indeed, no doubt but that some would have preferred a King but as long as the present Prime Minister has power there is no chance of this.

That the British had accomplished so much in Yorubaland by 1886 should not surprise us. Apart from the activities of the European traders and missionaries, which had preceded the wars, after fighting among themselves since the 1850s, the Yoruba were themselves war-weary and needed peace; hence their acceptance of the intervention by the British. The only state in Yorubaland that had effectively resisted the missionaries, the British traders, and the Lagos administration, until the 1880s was Ijebu.

A typical example of the rulers who stood up to the British consuls and missionaries was Jaja of Opobo (see Plate 6.3). He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order. When Jaja still refused to comply in spite of Johnston's threats to bombard his town with British gunboats, Johnston enticed Jaja on board a ship in 1887 under a promise of safeconduct but arrested him and sent him to Accra$^{49}$ where he was tried and deported to the West Indies.

The Benin kingdom began to feel the embarrassment of this development when its trading privileges in the coastal trade, especially its control over the com¬ merce on the Benin river in the western Niger delta, came to be challenged by European traders, mostly British, and the African middlemen, especially the Itsekiri and the Ijo. The eclipse of the Benin port of Ughoton dem¬ onstrated quite painfully to Benin that the days of its near monopoly of coastal trade had ended.\nThe coastal trade encouraged the spirit of political autonomy among the Itsekiri. This eventually led to a situation of war between the Olu of Warri and the qba of Benin, and the new wealth also nourished political conflicts within the Warri kingdom itself. There was, for example, so much rivalry and acrimony, so many succession disputes, protest migrations and the setting up of autonomous and rival power centres that for the rest of the century no generally acceptable successor could be found for the stool of the Olu of Warri when Akengbua, the incumbent from 1809, died in 1848. As with the Itsekiri kingdom, Agbor, whose monarchy had also been organized on the Benin model and operated as a Benin dependency, grew steadily into an autonomous state again largely under the influence of the new coastal trade. Ovonramwen, the last Oba of independent Benin, was determined to reinvigorate the kingdom and this policy included an expedition against Agbor with a view to re-asserting Benin authority there. The effort was, however, belated; the Benin expeditionary force against Agbor was just taking position at Obadan when the British expeditionary force against Benin itself was reported to be nearing the gate of the capital in 1897.32', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.637, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'Conquest and reaction in French West Africa, 1880-1900 > Dahomey', 'content': ""Behanzin, the king of Dahomey (Abomey), like Samori, chose the strategy of confrontation in defence of the sovereignty and independence of his state.$^{30}$ Direct conflict occurred during the last decade of the nineteenth century when France declared a protectorate over Porto Novo, a vassal of Abomey. This move constituted a serious blow to the economic interests of Abomey. In 1889, the heir to the throne, Prince Kondo, informed the governor of the RiviŁres de Sud, Bayol, that the Fon people would never accept such a situation. In February 1890, Bayol ordered the occupa› tion of Cotonou and the arrest of all the Fon notables in the town. Prince Kondo, who had begun his reign in December 1889 under the name of Behanzin, reacted by mobilizing his troops. At the time, Abomey had a permanent army which, in peacetime, numbered 4000 men and women. In wartime military service was compulsory for all males, supported by the Amazons, who were dreaded female warriors.\nThe French garrison was attacked at dusk, at the same time as part of the army dispatched to the region of Porto Novo set about destroying the palm trees. According to Behanzin, those economic counter-measures quickly induced the French to sue for peace. On 3 October, Father DorgŁre presented himself in Abomey with proposals for peace. In return for the recognition of Cotonou as a French possession and the right of the French to levy custom duties and station a garrison of troops there, the French were to pay Behanzin an annuity of 20000 francs. The king accepted these terms and the treaty was signed on 3 October 1890. However, to defend the rest of his state, the king started to modernize his army. Between January 1891 and August 1892 he purchased, '1,700 rapid-firing rifles, six Krupp cannon of various bore, five machine-guns, 400,000 assorted cartridges and a large quantity of shell'$^{31}$ from German firms operating in Lome."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The structure of Volume VII', 'content': 'It will be seen from these chapters that the view that Africans received the invading soldiers with elation and quickly accepted colonial rule is not borne out by the available evidence. In fact, African reactions were the very reverse. It is quite evident that Africans were faced with only two options, either to readily surrender their sovereignty and independence, or to defend them at all costs. It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.\nJohn D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty. To them, there could be no compromise on that, and indeed many of the leaders of these states chose to die on the battlefield, go into voluntary flight or face exile rather than surrender their sovereignty without a struggle.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The state of African preparedness', 'content': 'What was the attitude of the Africans themselves to the establishment of colonialism, involving as it did such a fundamental change in the nature of the relationships that had existed between them and the Europeans over the preceding three hundred years? This is a question that has so far not been seriously considered by historians, African or European, but it needs to be answered. The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy. Asante must remain as of old at the same time to remain friendly with all white men. I do not write this in a boastful spirit but in the clear sense of its meaning ... the cause of Asante is progressing and there is no reason for any Asante man to feel alarm at the prospects or to believe for a single instant that our cause has been driven back by the events of the past hostilities. 2\nIn 1895, Wobogo, the Moro Naba, or King of the Mossi (in modern Upper Volta), told the French officer, Captain Destenave: I know that the whites wish to kill me in order to take my country, and yet you claim that they will help me to organize my country. But I find my country good just as it is. I have no need of them.

They therefore opposed the exchange of forts that the British contemplated with the Dutch in order to make their respective territories homogeneous.

Those African rulers who have been mistakenly termed collaborators were those who thought that the best way of safeguarding their sovereignty or even regaining the sovereignty that they might have lost to some African power previous to the arrival of the Europeans was not to collaborate but rather to ally with the European invaders. A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation. But as we have seen, the Africans were all faced with the question of surrendering, retaining or regaining their sovereignty.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858.

' 8 A number of historians, indeed, have stressed the importance of dis› criminating between resistances which were motivated by the desire of a ruling group to retain its exploitative power, and resistances on a much wider scale, which were often directed as much against the authoritarianism of African rulers as against colonial oppression. Edward Steinhart urges that protest and resistance can be and are directed ... against domestic forms of oppression ... Protest must be viewed as something other than the expression of national aspirations ... by focusing on leader› ship we have accepted the interpretation of anti-colonialism as 'African nationalism', a movement to expel aliens and to restore 'national' independence. If instead we look within the protest movements ... we are apt to discover that the impulses which the leaders organize and interpret are profoundly anti-authoritarian and revolutionary rather than anti-foreign and 'nationalist'. 19 Even where a long-established polity enjoyed a leadership with recog› nized legitimacy and was able to mobilize the majority of its population into resistance, recent historians have been inclined to criticize 'the narrow sense of primordial loyalty' and the 'parochialism' which did no more than to focus on sovereignty as previously understood. Such historians have emphasized instead the significance of those resistances in which the idea of sovereignty was redefined. Thus Isaacman argues that the 1917 revolt in the Zambezi valley was unlike previous resistances there, 'which were designed to regain the independence of a historical polity or a group of related peoples'. The 1917 revolt 'sought to liberate all the peoples of the Zambezi from colonial oppression', appealing especially to the oppressed peasantry of whatever ethnicity.

Wanga kings had a tradition of employing mercenaries to fight for their cause. Thus, in Mumia's thinking, the British were simply another group of mercenaries to be used. Likewise, the British saw in Mumia a willing agent to help them to extend their control over the whole area. Indeed, the British occupation of western Kenya was accomplished largely through his help. This debt was freely acknowledged by British officials, among whom was Sir Harry Johnston who noted that 'he [Mumia] from the very first regarded British officials and the idea of a British Protectorate with hearty good-will.

The Nandi in Kenya, for instance, resisted militarily the construc› tion of the railway through their territory. Of all the peoples of Kenya, they put up the strongest and longest military resistance to British im› perialism; it began in the 1890s and did not end until their leader was murdered by the British commanders in 1905, on his way to the negotiations which had been treacherously arranged. That event weakened Nandi resistance and eventually led to the British occupation of their territory.\nThat the Nandi resisted the British for over seven years was due to the nature of their society. Nandi society was divided into territorial units called pororiet. Warriors from each unit were responsible for the defence of the territory. For this reason, the warriors slept in a common hut. This was the nearest thing to a standing army. These territorial armies came together under the leadership of an orgoiyot, or traditional leader. It was he who decided when the army would go on a raid. The armies were linked to him through a personal representative who sat at each territorial council. Because territory rather than clan was the centre of Nandi social life, this meant that clan rivalry was absent. The result was a cohesive society, and it was this cohesion that gave the society military superiority over its neighbours. Maison writes that 'It is surprising that so small a tribe as the Nandi was able to terrorize much larger peoples and to continue to do so almost with impunity for several decades.' 11 Given the social cohesion of the society as well as the confidence of the warriors both in themselves and in their leaders, it is not surprising that they became a military power to reckon with. Their military successes led them to believe that they were superior to other people, white men included. As G. W. B. Huntingford noted, 'The Nandi thinks himself at least the equal, if not the superior of the whiteman; and any estimate of the changes brought about by the impact of our civilization must be considered in the light of this fact'.$^{12}$ The Nandi successfully resisted this occupation for over seven years, then, because of the success with which the society had been knit together as a fighting force."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in North-East Africa,', 'section_title': 'Egypt > The 1919 Revolution', 'content': ""Britain's colonial diplomacy of 'divide and rule' made extensive use of this cleavage in the Wafd's ranks.

In case of the blockade not fulfilling expectation, we might find the people of Abeokuta useful allies; and the King of Dahomey had been twice or thrice foiled in his attempts against that country, so that he would be likely to think twice before giving fresh provocation.\n\nLord Cardwell thought it of great importance that the King of Dahomey should understand that we were in earnest in this matter. The King had been reported to have said that he should treat a message from the Commodore with contempt, but that one from the Queen of England would be treated very differently. It was desirable that this potentate should be taught that the Commodore was the representative of Her Majesty. It was important to prevent such mischievous notions getting abroad, and if the blow were dealt firmly and promptly, the effect was likely to be more satisfactory and lasting.\n\nThe subject then dropped.'}, {'id': 3801, 'article_title': 'ABEOKUTA', 'full_section_title': 'ABEOKUTA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1879#article-11', 'issue_date': '01_05_1879', 'content': ""\n\nsea-coast, beyond which neither the British Government nor the British people have any desire to extend their jurisdiction in the Egba and Yoruba countries, there must, if the desired work of industrial development on which Lagos and other sea-coast stations depend for their prosperity is to become a reality and be vigorously carried on, be an interior allied town and power co-operating and working in continuous unison with Lagos. That town must be Abeokuta; that power must be the power of authorities and people concentrated at Abeokuta. Possessed by these views and feelings, from which we have never deviated through all the troubles and disputes between Abeokuta and Lagos, and between the Egba and British authorities in these two places—troubles and disputes originating in mutual misconception, and fostered by interested malevolence and individual ambitions, interests, and hatreds—we have waited patiently until the storms of passion and the vapours of distrust should pass away. We hope and believe that these have now ever passed away. We learn with a satisfaction which it is not possible for us to find words adequately to describe, that the long conflicting interests in Abeokuta have now become reconciled, and that one generally recognized authority is now acknowledged there. This is a most important step in the right direction for assisting in the realization of our plans for the good of Abeokuta and its industrious, persevering people. We want Abeokuta to become strong—so defensively, not offensively, strong that no kingdom, or tribe, or people, or state shall dare to attack or seek to injure her or her people. We want absolute security for the Egba farms, that the labourer may work in full and entire confidence that he shall enjoy the fruit of his labours. Although the British Government has been hitherto powerless—simply because they have not taken up the matter in earnest—to put an end to the abominations of Dahomey, their energetic representations to its King that they would consider any further invasion of the Egba territory by him or by his army as a direct offence to themselves, has served to secure Abeokuta and its farms and villages from those raids which were almost annually repeated, and which occasioned the loss of so many lives and the destruction of so much property on Egba lands. But it is time that Abeokuta, distant only sixty or seventy miles from Lagos, should become so strong that she may command immunity from attack, whether from Dahomey or any other quarter, not merely by the good offices of the friendly British Government, though these must always be of importance to her, but by her own power and strength. That she may acquire fully that power and strength, she must be no longer isolated, as at present, but brought into territorial alliance and ready intercourse with Lagos by means of improved land communication between the two towns. To secure for Abeokuta all the advantages she needs and is entitled to, that improved land communication must be by a railway from Gaiun to Abeokuta. Every reduction of even one hour in the duration of journey between Lagos and Abeokuta is an added strength to the Egba capital. How greatly, then, will Abeokuta be strengthened when the journey between it and Lagos, the conveyance of produce, passengers, and goods, shall be reduced to four or five hours only! It is not easy to realize in one's mind the immense advantage that will accrue to Abeokuta and to the whole Egba and Yoruba countries by the establishment of such ready means of access between Abeokuta and Lagos. There must, however, now be educated Africans in Abeokuta who can so far realize the advantages in their minds as to enable them to show and explain and to convince the native authorities and people in Abeokuta of those advantages. As regards Lagos, we can scarcely conceive the necessity of effort to convince any one there. Lagos can only become a grand, rich town by large and prosperous trade; and every increased facility of transit in the interior, and from the interior to Lagos, every additional security to farming and other industrial operations at and around Abeokuta, which serves to increase the supply of exportable produce to Lagos and the consequent demand for British manufactured and other goods, becomes necessarily a factor in future Lagos grandeur, prosperity, and wealth. We do not, therefore, think it necessary to write one word to excite enthusiasm among the people of Lagos respecting and in favour of a proposed railway between Gaiun and Abeokuta. If they wish an increase of wealth-bestowing commerce and trade, they ought to strain every nerve to help us in our arduous effort to obtain for the people of Abeokuta that means of ready access for themselves and their produce with Lagos. On the score of increased health alone for the people of the interior and Lagos, both of which would be equally benefited in this important matter, rapid communication between Abeokuta and Lagos is so desirable, that every thinking man ought to be ready to make considerable sacrifices, if necessary, to secure the advantage. When our mind dwells on the subject of the proposed road and its beneficial influences, the prospect opening before us is so pleasing and so grand, that we cannot help deploring the time did not sooner arrive for this onward step, so that we might hope to live to record the interesting and wonderful results. We see Abeokuta in immediate communication with Lagos, with railway working, and steamboat service from Gaiun so improved as to reduce the journey to three hours. We see the heavily laden trains of produce, goods, and passengers passing between the two places. We see Abeokuta so strong and wealthy through that communication and constant friendly alliance with Lagos, that Ibadan and every populous town throughout Yoruba are begging of Abeokuta's rich men to help them with money to make roads from their towns to Abeokuta, so that their people may bring their produce to it, and go down themselves to Lagos and behold the sea. We see produce and people pouring into Abeokuta from Rabba, and even from Kano and Kooka; Abeokuta having become the great emporium to which all the produce of interior and surrounding countries comes, to be exchanged there for the European and other goods and manufactures brought also there to be exchanged for that produce. All these, and other greater results, we see in our mind accruing to Abeokuta as the result of that short line of railway which we now propose to have constructed between Gaiun and Abeokuta. It will not, therefore, be matter for surprise that, with our deep and ardent desire for progress in Africa, and the happiness and well-being of its people, we should have determined to make every possible effort for introducing this wonder-working agent of advanced civilization into the Egba country. There is not any realized wealth in Abeokuta that could be made available by its government and people toward the construction of the proposed road. We must present this great work to them; trusting for our pecuniary repayment to what profits the conveyance of passengers and goods over it may yield to us after payment of working expenses and a contribution to a fund for the ultimate repayment of capital. We have not, however, any anxiety as to the prospects of subscribers. A road from such a place as Lagos to such a place as Abeokuta—with a large population at each extremity and around the interior terminus— in a country where the people are so given to industry that enormous quantities of produce may be safely calculated upon, cannot fail to give adequate returns to investors, who will certainly benefit themselves while conferring incalculable advantages upon a most interesting people—a nation composed of the united remnants of many formerly very large tribes, the great masses of which perished in the wars provoked by the foreign slave-traders who were in search of victims at Lagos, or shipped thence (with exception of the many poor exhausted wretches who served as food for the great shoals of sharks in the Lagos waters) as slaves for the supply of the plantations in Jamaica, Demerara, Porto Rico, Cuba, the United States, and Brazil. If we recall the memory of those sad times, so disgraceful to Christian Europe, it is that we acknowledge an obligation on the part of all Christian people in England to help forward every good work in countries which but too many, alas! of our fellow-countrymen, or the fellow-countrymen of our forefathers, helped to depopulate and ruin by active participation in the unspeakable abomination of a foreign African slave-trade.

We cannot express the intensity of our regret to see that the heathen portion of the Abeokuta people are entering upon such a course of violence and outrage upon those to whom they owe all the consideration and friendship with which Abeokuta has been regarded in England. Such a course, if persisted in, may yet throw them into the power of the Dahomans, whose animosity is unrelenting. We have reason to believe they have been urged on to these deplorable acts of violence by the instigation of the King of Jebu; and if such counsels continue to prevail with them, and the Bashorun and principal chiefs who act with him cannot control them, we look upon Abeokuta as in a very dangerous position. Great Britain, represented in their neighbourhood by the British colony of Lagos and its Governor, is their only true friend; and if in close friendship and alliance with Lagos, every good is before them. But we fear that even the Bashorun and his friends have entered upon a course in which they are like the dog on the banks of a lake, the piece of meat in whose mouth was magnified by reflection in its waters, and who lost the substance by greedily and foolishly trying to seize the larger but deceitful shadow.', 'last_edit_date': '1867-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1867#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ABEOKUTA AND DAHOMEY', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The differences that have arisen between this mighty country of Great Britain and the weak and puny Dahomey, aggravated as they have been by the insensate insolence of King Gélélé in his reply to the demands of Commodore Sir William Hewett, are well worthy to occupy the attention of the authorities and people of Abeokuta. There is one point that we would impress strongly upon them. This is, that Great Britain will not recede from the demands made on the King of Dahomey by Commodore Hewett; and, consequently, that should the blockade of the Dahoman ports, which will commence on the 1st of July next, fail in its object of bringing the King to reason, and to a full compliance with the demands that have been made upon him, other and more effective means will most certainly be employed. What those means must necessarily be it is not at all difficult to imagine. The Power that directed the long and difficult march on the capital of Ashanti is not likely to shrink from the comparatively short and easy march on Abomey. It is, therefore, well that the authorities and people of Abeokuta should set themselves at once earnestly to consider what it will be their duty and their interest to do should it become necessary for Great Britain to adopt such extreme measures against their bitter and inveterate enemy. Dahomey has been and, unless its power be broken and destroyed, or it be restrained by engagements entered into with Great Britain, will continue to be, year by year, a ruinous curse to the Egba people. Year by year it has invaded their territory, cruelly butchered most of those whom it could surprise in the open villages and farms between the frontier of Dahomey and Abeokuta, and carried off the remainder of them for more protracted torture and more cruel death in the fearful ""Customs"" of Abomey. Every Egba heart that has in it a spark of love of country ought to beat high with hope of entire deliverance from the attacks of so cruel a foe, and with eagerness to assist in that work of retribution which has been too long delayed. Although the Egbas, not being themselves an organized military power, like Dahomey, have never been able of themselves, when they have turned back the tide of invasion from the walls of Abeokuta, to pursue their enemy into the Dahoman territory, they must certainly be quite as capable of supporting the fatigues of a march on Abomey, and of providing themselves with the necessary provisions for such a march, as ever the Dahomans were to support the fatigues and provide themselves with provisions for their marches on Abeokuta. It would be their duty and for their interests, therefore, to take part in any chastisement to be inflicted by Great Britain on Dahomey. To enable them to do this at the proper moment, they ought at once to decide upon what their expeditionary force shall be, and to arrange the necessary supply of provisions for it; so that should the moment for action arrive, they may be able to take advantage of that moment, and proceed without delay to the frontier of Dahomey—to those river fords over which the King and his Amazons have so often passed to burn their villages and farms, and slaughter and carry away captive, for a more fearful butchery during their ""Customs,"" the laborious and unoffending Egbas. We imagine that there could be but one feeling in Abeokuta on this subject, and that is, a firm determination to show themselves worthy of their ancient fame, and to assist in putting an end at once and for ever to all possibility of any future invasions by Kings of Dahomey. As is the duty of the people of Abeokuta, such also is the duty of the Akus everywhere along the West Coast. Although they cannot go themselves to such a war, they can assist their brethren in Abeokuta in many important ways, which it ought not to be necessary for us to detail. There is only one further remark that we would make at present. Let it not enter into the heads of the authorities and people of Abeokuta, or of the Akus in the British Settlements, or elsewhere along the West Coast, that their co-operation in the way we have pointed out is at all indispensable to Great Britain. Great Britain *alone* is quite equal to the task of capturing and destroying a hundred Abomeys, if there were such, without assistance from, or the co-operation of, the Egbas, whether in or out of Abeokuta. We have merely pointed out to them what true honour and patriotism, and a correct appreciation of their own future interests, should counsel and impel them to do. We have done our duty in putting this plainly before them; we shall see how they will perform theirs should the occasion arise.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1876#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'DAHOMEY', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Our correspondent who advises that when a rattlesnake is to be killed it should have its head taken off, and not merely be pinched by the tail, was at the time he wrote indulging the very reasonable expectation that Her Majesty\'s Government would not sit down tamely under the obstinate and insulting defiance of Dahomey, but mete out to the wretched King of that country the full measure of punishment that is his due. That no note of preparation for inflicting that punishment has yet been sounded, will not, we hope, be so misinterpreted as to induce the belief that all idea or intention of inflicting it has been abandoned. The hesitation and delay may well give rise to this belief; but we feel that, however ill-advised they may seem to be when viewed with relation to British prestige on the West Coast, and however we may deplore them in our anxiety to see that the horrible butcheries of Abomey, and the plundering, devastating, murdering expeditions undertaken with the object of procuring victims for those feasts of blood, have been put an end to at once and for ever, there may be very reasonable considerations on the part of Her Majesty\'s Government to explain the inertia. While the fate of Europe—peace or war—is in the balance, through the complications which have arisen from the disturbances in its Eastern countries, it is not difficult to conceive why a matter of comparatively infinitesimal importance as regards Imperial interests should be put aside for a more convenient opportunity. The British Government cannot recede from the position in which it has been placed by the action of Commodore Hewett, which has received their sanction and approval. The King of Dahomey must either make an unquestionably satisfactory and full *amende*, or receive a full measure of punishment. If reliance can be placed on the news by the steamship Gambia which reached us on the 26th February, King Gelélé has determined that his measure of iniquity shall be ""heaped up—running over.""

The gross mistake—nothing can make us view it in any other light—of exempting those wretched coast pirate towns between Whydah and Quittah from the blockade, has enabled the King of Dahomey to continue his defiance of the British power hitherto, and will still enable him to do so, because through them he receives all absolutely necessary supplies. That mistake neutralizes the effect of the Whydah blockade, which, being inoperative except as regards Whydah itself, is a useless exposure of Her Majesty\'s ships of war to danger and disease.', 'last_edit_date': '1877-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1877#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Address of the Egbas at Bathurst to their Friends in Abeokuta', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We, the undersigned Egbas by descent, now located at Bathurst Town, St. Mary's River, Gambia, to the Chiefs, our brethren, countrymen, &c., bearing rule at Abeokuta, greeting:—\n\nWe cordially and sincerely wish you all grace and peace from God our Father, and his Son Jesus Christ.\n\nWhereas we have been informed, from undoubted and good authorities, that you, our beloved countrymen at Abeokuta, have recently been involved in quarrels with the British Government, and are ready to take up arms against them.\n\nWe, therefore, anticipating the dismal calamities, misfortunes, and distress that will inevitably result upon our nation from this quarrel, deem it an indispensable duty of sincere and affectionate brethren seasonably to interfere; and hope, by God's grace, to prevail on you with wholesome advice, in order that a stop might speedily be put to these impending and approaching evils.

I have recently returned from another visit to West Africa, during which I have again been to Abeokuta. At present the authorities there have no intention to grant any favour to the prejudice of British interests; but I think something more should be done to attach the natives of the interior to our Government. Whether deserved or not we have a reputation of being slow and supine. The Egbas (the people of Abeokuta) are sometimes tempted to act unpleasantly towards us. There is a disaffected section in the community, by whom the loyal chiefs are occasionally harassed. On the occasion of my last visit to Abeokuta, last April, intelligence had arrived respecting the Dahomian attack on Porto Novo. It was currently reported that the English had secretly connived with the Dahomians, and an attempt was made to raise an ante-English demonstration. On April 7 important deliberations were conducted by the authorities. Ebullitions of anger were here and there displayed, and an attack was expected. However, the cloud passed off, and the ground of this suspicion appeared to be that an influential Dahomian prince had been for some weeks residing in Lagos. On this occasion I was returning from a tour through the Yaruba country. The region through which I travelled was in a state of great unrest. At Jubu Ode the King and chiefs expressed their vexation over the interminable Ibadan and Ilorin, which are sadly interfering with trade. The Ibadans, while prolonging their strife with Ilorin, are also troubled with the Egbas raiding their farms. The relations between Ibadan and Oyo are in a condition of extreme tension. At Ogbomosho complaints were loud on account of the spoliation of their farms by the Ilorians, with kidnapping and occasional slaughter. Within the last few years thirteen Yaruba towns have been destroyed by the Dahomians, and seven towns were destroyed last year. From what I can gather these towns have about 4,000 inhabitants, while several were much larger. In my journey I passed through the ruins of some of the towns which, a few years ago, were large and influential centres of population and commerce, notably Ijayi and Biolorun Pellu. It would be an unspeakable mercy if some benevolent civilised Power could interfere to cause the chronic strife to cease, and develop the riches of the country. After getting some fifty or sixty miles from the coast the country is comparatively healthy and fertile, as the plantations of cotton, indigo, &c., show, and in some parts rich in mineral treasure. I saw several iron pits and smelting furnaces, and have specimens of iron ore by me. I availed myself of the opportunities afforded me in interviews with kings and chiefs to urge on them the necessity of peace and industry, and was received with welcome wherever I went in the Yaruba country. The reply of one chief was remarkable. He said, “You tell us how much we should be advantaged if we would abandon our quarrels and unite for strength and prosperity. Your words are true; but we are like children fighting. Each is ashamed to be the first to stop, but both wish for nothing better than for some strong man to step between us and send us away to do something wiser.”', 'last_edit_date': '1889-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1889#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Proposed French Occupation of Abeokuta', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Telegraphic advices received at Liverpool on June 4 from Lagos report that the French Resident official at Porto Novo was at Lagos, and that the occupation of Abeokuta and Dahomey was being freely discussed.

Such an act would mean the absolute ruin of Lagos. It was unanimously resolved to send a petition to Lord Knutsford, the Colonial Secretary, drawing his attention to the seriousness of the subject, and asking if the Colonial Office had also received information of the matter. It was further requested that the Government would immediately take any action which was in the interest of the colony of Lagos. One of the local members of Parliament was also asked to take up the matter.

The way in which they have finally resisted the advance of the little handful of British troops and native allies upon their capital, fully justifies the reputation they had obtained for personal bravery and military skill; while the uselessness of their resistance shows how completely all those countries in West Africa, within a hundred or two hundred miles of the sea-coast, are at the command of the civilized powers of Europe, of whom Great Britain alone has taken any real interest in their affairs. After the evidence which the Ashanti expedition has supplied, there cannot be a doubt—and there ought not to be a doubt in the mind of any native African authority—that 5,000 British troops, supposing they could be made secure from the evil influences of climate, and that they could obtain proper food and means of conveying sufficient ammunition, could traverse native Africa from east to west and from north to south, everywhere triumphant. Is not this a great lesson for West African potentates and other native authorities? The King of Dahomey will do well to take it seriously to heart, when meditating another grand diabolical ""custom,"" with its unspeakably horrifying human sacrifices; or another inroad into the Egba territory, in pursuance of his insane ambition or revenge against Abeokuta. Abomey is not more than half the distance from Whydah that Kumasi is from Cape Coast, and the country is much more accessible, open, and practicable for a body of troops. Christian Europe—now that Ashanti horrors have been so fully exposed, and, we will venture to hope, put an end to—will not much longer tolerate similar and even worse practices in Dahomey. We, at least, will do our part, that they shall not. If Great Britain does not interfere to put an end to them, some other European power will take possession of Whydah, and do so. It would be a conquest rich in mercantile results, while invaluable in the cause of outraged humanity and not a little important as regards facilities for introducing to the knowledge of those great truths, which can alone successfully combat and destroy the debasing and destructive sway of Satan, so long supreme over the vast countries of West and Central Africa. While thus giving warning to Dahomey, we should be greatly wanting in our duty if we did not give a word of advice—and we would have it looked upon as a large one—to our friends, the Egbas and Jebus. Our friendship for Abeokuta is too well known and has been too well evidenced for any one to deny or dispute it; we have given many and great proofs of it, and, therefore, we ought not to be misunderstood, when, with all our heart, we counsel and advise the authorities there and in Jebu, not to raise or prolong causes of contention with the British authorities in Lagos; or put forward pretensions which the well-known and, even in West Africa, sufficiently well understood principles by which British action and government is guided, must prevent her listening to. Egba, Jebu, their kings, authorities, and peoples, have nothing to fear from Great Britain, while they cultivate friendly relations with her Government in Lagos, and do all they can to facilitate and extend their trade with that place. But—and let them lay this well to heart—they can never be safe if they choose to pick quarrels with the Lagos Government. If this does wrong to them at any time, they may be sure that such is not the wish or intention of the Queen’s Government in England; and their representations, if made directly to it in a proper manner, will be sure to receive attention, because they will be seconded by us and other friends of Africa. We see a great and proud future for Abeokuta, and the Egba and Jebu countries generally, if they will but comprehend their true interests, and show themselves ready to second the English desires for the extension and development of trade and resources in them and beyond them. We have a mental view—we can see that future in our mind, though native African prejudice may prevent it from becoming a reality for yet a short time—we have a mental view of a good road, and soon after, even a rail or tram road, from the Lagoon, through Abeokuta, to Ibadan, in one direction, and to the Niger at Rabba, in another. These would make Abeokuta the great interior emporium of trade with the whole of that vast African interior, from the sea-side to the Niger, and the further side of that river; and Lagos, the great shipping port for all the produce—a hundred, aye, and many a hundredfold more than passes through her at this present time. This is an eventuality that must and will be realized. No opposition that native Africa can show, will prevent the progress of that great march of trade and commerce, which caters for the wants, and fulfils the demands of the civilized world that the natural resources of the whole earth shall be developed, and the products be made to minister to its use and enjoyment; while, in return, it imports its civilization and its wealth. The people of Jebu and Abeokuta do not at present comprehend the great advantage they have in Lagos being a British settlement. They do not seem to be conscious of the importance of the fact that this secures them at all times, upon certain and easy conditions, a safe port for their trade—a full security that the trade which must in time make Egba and Jebu, with their industrious populations, fat with wealth and riches, can never be interfered with by any other power; whereas, if Great Britain were not there, there is more than one other that might and would seek to conquer and keep possession of those countries, the undeveloped wealth and future possible importance of which is at last beginning to be understood and appreciated in Europe. No man can be a friend to Egba and Jebu who does not advise and entreat them to be always close friends with Lagos and its British authorities. Whatever his pretensions may be, if he counsel them to any other policy, any other course than this, he must be their enemy. In close alliance and friendship with Great Britain at Lagos, they have, as before observed, not only a happy present, but a glorious future before them—a future in which Great Britain will largely assist, and to which, without her friendship and aid, they can never attain.

The progress of the Khartoum Relief Expedition, the better government of Egypt, the high-handed action of the Boers in Zululand, the activity of German aggression on the West Coast, and the vast possibilities involved in the systematic colonisation of the Congo territory, represent only a few of the more urgent considerations now forcing themselves on the country\'s attention.

In the USA, the idea of the repatriation of Africans had been mentioned occasionally throughout the eighteenth century, most notably in 1777, when Thomas Jefferson sponsored a report in a committee of the Virginia legislature. Repatriation began in earnest after 1815, however, when a small group of thirty-eight black Americans led by Paul Cuffe returned to Africa. By 1830, Liberia had become the focus for a general colony of repatriated Africans, mostly ex-slaves, sponsored by the American Colonization Society with the financial support of the Federal as well as many State governments. By i860, only about 15000 settlers had returned to Africa. After the Civil War, less than 2000 settlers made the trip, despite the rapid deterioration of the conditions of life for Afro-Americans in the USA.\nTwo other sources provided returning immigrants. The first came from the unknown number of maroons and Africans taken from confiscated slave ships during the nineteenth century, and shipped back to Africa by the British in their zealous attempt to terminate the trade in slaves and replace it by 'legitimate' trade. The second source of African returnees came from an even smaller number of missionaries recruited in the Caribbean and southern states of the USA, principally by the Moravians and Presby› terians, to assist in the propagation of the Christian Gospel in West Africa. The most well-known example of this is perhaps the Basel Mission enterprise among the Akwapim hills of Ghana in the 1830s and 1840s, and their decision in 1843 to use Jamaicans as substitutes for German and Swiss missionaries whose mortality in the field proved too high for evan› gelical efficacy."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Back-to-Africa movements', 'content': ""Liberia - although founded by American whites through the ACS long before the period of the Scramble - occupies a special place in any con› sideration of immigration between different spheres of the black world.

The Society would sell shares or land rights offered by African petitioners but only to Afro-American or African purchasers. 4 Bishop Turner also later served as an adviser to the International Migration Society (IMS) of Alabama, which sent about 500 emigrants to Africa before it became defunct in 1900. Some of the 500 remained in Liberia; others returned to the United States. Those who remained fared reasonably well; evidently more than a few of them prospered. On the other hand, those who returned told horror stories of poor land, inadequate food and poor living conditions. These stories reduced the likelihood of any large-scale Afro-American emigration movement, even though prospects for blacks in the United States were declining from 1895 to 1900. Nevertheless, numerous Afro-Americans evidently continued to give serious consider› ation to African emigration, just as others in the United States and the Caribbean simply moved away from overt discriminatory practices into other regions near by.\nAfter the turn of the twentieth century, the back-to-Africa baton was picked up by others. For example, one Captain Dean, early in the twentieth century, hoped to engineer the settlement of American blacks in South Africa to fashion a powerful black state there. After the briefest sojourn meant to arrange for this settlement, however, white authorities expelled Dean from the Cape for what were termed 'provocative activities'. And in 1914, Chief Alfred C. Sam, a Gold Coast African, turned up in Oklahoma, persuaded about sixty black farmers that Africa offered them greater oppor› tunities and sailed with them to Saltpond in the Gold Coast. Finding Chief Sam's claims to be exaggerated and encountering restrictions from the Gold Coast officials which inhibited the entry of American immigrants, most of the Oklahomans eventually returned to the United States.

Repatri› ation during the nineteenth century offered few material rewards for Europeans or non-Europeans. But by 1900, the divergence between Africa and the Americas had become too great. Persons of African descent became caught up in the self-consciousness of the age which produced the type of xenophobic nationalism that all but destroyed the appeal of Africa. More› over, the interest in Africa after the end of the slave trade grew from national lusts for power and wealth - and Afro-Americans lacked both political power and the wealth needed to stimulate their own interest, or influence those who were partitioning Africa into colonial spheres. The Afro-American view became focused more on the new developments within their hemisphere. Internal and inter-regional migrations and the quest to establish the good life against new deleterious challenges absorbed their attention. The African connection faded, but did not die. The return-toAfrica movement found individual promoters who could occasionally infuse the movement with new appeal.

At the age of 28, Garvey went to the United States attracted by Washington's work, fired by Duse's example, and armed with a programme of race redemption: the establish› ment of industrial and agricultural schools for blacks in Jamaica, a Black Star fleet of ships for commerce between blacks in Africa and the Americas, and, most of all, a 'central nation for the race'.

Cre› ativity became especially necessary where a small number of Europeans lived among a large number of Africans as was the case in many colonies of exploitation such as Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Saint-Domingue. Where the European population failed to comprise a critical mass, the Africans had to build a society from a diverse collectivity of individuals who had little more in common than their skin colour and their servility.

Maroon towns existed for equally long periods in Esmeraldas in Ecuador and in parts of the Blue Mountains and the Cockpit Country of Jamaica.

Ford himself answered such a call by a delegation of Fälasa (black Ethiopian Jews) and left for Ethiopia in 1930 where he evidently remained until his death during the time of the Italian-Ethiopian War (1935-6).$^{I2}$ The majority of the American emigrants Ford encountered in Ethiopia when he arrived there were Jamaicans, and, occasionally, other Afro-Caribbean folk. A recent account suggests that 'the West Indians appear to have been more prepared than some of the Americans to make what adjustments were necessary to living in Ethiopia' although both groups suffered discrimination from time to time. 1 3 Of course, even before Garvey's time, other American blacks had emigrated to Ethiopia, but as individual settlers. For example, in the 1890s Benito Sylvain, a Haitian, brought to the Court of Menelik II a plan for a 'Pan-Negro' organization. Clearly, however, the largest waves of American black immigrants came in the late 1920s and early 1930s, that is, after Garvey's break with the Liberians and through the time of the Emperor's accession, with the greatest numbers of these responding to meetings with Ethiopian travellers. In the period immediately following the restoration of Haile Sellassie in 1941, a new trickle of Afro-Americans (possibly twenty) came to Ethiopia. The period, however, falls beyond the scope of this chapter.

It seems, therefore, that although the UNIA depu› tation failed to establish organizational links with the Horn of Africa as with Liberia, it did succeed in orienting a number of prospective American black emigrants towards service there. Possibly more individual Garveyites emigrated to Ethiopia than to Liberia.

In some cases, the influences from Africa were strong enough and pervasive enough to forge a genuine Afro-American culture competing with, and sometimes complementing the Europeanderived culture.\nIn the USA the political-structure imposed a rigid dichotomy between black and white in the population, relegating any individual with any degree of African ancestry to the category of black.$^{51}$ By contrast, throughout the rest of the hemisphere a three-tiered social categorization prevailed, corres› ponding to the dominant groups of black, mixed, and white. The relatively small number of white persons at the top of the social pyramid in most societies afforded the dominant African majorities the opportunity to impose their values and their cultures on the rest of the society.\nWithin the three-tiered structure each caste had its own set of legal rights and social privileges based on a combination of wealth, colour and occupation. In the sugar and plantation-based economic zones of Brazil, the Caribbean, and the lowlands of Mexico, Colombia and Peru, the rights of slaves as well as free persons of colour tended to be circumscribed in direct proportion to the overall demands of their labour.

Britain took the opportunity to renew its attempts to internationalize the issue, and extended its naval suppression to cover the whole of the Atlantic and Indian oceans. An 'equipment' clause in the treaties allowed the seizure of ships obviously equipped for the slave traffic, even though not carrying human cargoes. But the slave ships of the USA remained exempt. For forty years American diplomacy managed to evade any serious commitment. In 1820 the trade was legally equated with piracy; in 1842 came the compromise of'checking the flag', which protected the Americans from British suppressive action; and 80-gun suppression squadrons served to safeguard national pride whilst at the same time remaining mere formalities.

It is not certain that their condition would be very much improved by emigration, though they would be relieved of some of the restraints to which they are now subjected. Their removal would not be of advantage to this country. They are needed where they are to raise cotton and rice, sugar, tobacco, and corn. Negro labour is required for the development of the southern country, and in time coloured people in that section will have their civil and political rights fully recognized. This recognition may come peaceably, by the assent of their neighbours, and a denial of their rights will at the most only postpone it. A large exodus of negroes would be a great calamity to the landowners and business men of the South, as it would cause an advance in the price of labour. While, therefore, the emigrants would gain but little, and the country and more especially the southern portions, would sustain a loss by such an emigration, the coloured people who should remain would be the gainers by it, as their labour would be in greater demand, and they would receive better treatment from employers. It is not probable that the Government will afford any encouragement to an outward movement of a needed class of citizens, even though they ask it, and few of the coloured people can go to Liberia without aid. Those who are able to go are most of them so well off as to be contented where they are, and under the present system of employing negro labour at the South, there is not likely to be a rapid increase of the independent class at present.

It is the first time we have heard that there could be a doubt as to the fact of residence in a British possession conferring in inalienable title to liberty. What!—we are not to receive these freed negroes, escaped from the Southern States or freed by the advance of the Northern armies—we are not to receive them, although our colonies are pining for labourers so much, that they have imported 10,880 coolies from the East Indies during the season 1861-2, *because they may possibly be reclaimed by the Southern States, as being the property of their subjects or citizens?* We are ashamed to see such words on record, in what we are bound to presume to be a faithful account of an interview between a Foreign Minister and one of our principal Secretaries of State. Surely some member of the House of Commons will inquire whether such a reason was ever alleged by any member of the British Government.\n\nWith regard to the emigration of the said negroes to the British colonies, we may be allowed to express our opinion that it could be arranged much better by a private organization, or by allowing the Colonial Governments to act without the control of the Home Government. Our own experience in the matter justifies us in expressing the doubt of there being any desire on the part of the Home Government that our West Indian colonies should receive any additions to their present amount of negro population, except by the natural increase of those already there. Would it not be better, therefore, to state this frankly and openly?

Another resolution was resolved—""Also, that we have come to the conclusion herein expressed in sorrow and not in anger; that we earnestly hope our appeal will be heeded, and that the sorrow of a separation from life-time friends, old homes, past associations, and the graves of relatives and kindred may thus be avoided.

It seems to me an extraordinary thing that in all that is said about the impossible situation on the other side of the water, it is constantly lost sight of that these black people were transported thither forcibly and utterly against their will, and that it was only to be expected that an impossible state of things would sooner or later be created. There are two expressions in Mr. Edmondston\'s letter which appear to me utterly to misstate the case. He abhors the idea of \'Anglo-Saxon blood submitting tamely to the oppression of a horde of savage negroes.\' He also says \'there happens to exist within their borders an alien and inferior race.\' Surely, Sir, this is not a correct statement of the case. These American folk did not hesitate to use the labour of the black people without payment until the last war put an end to the bondage, but there are certain points that they must not refuse to consider if they desire to escape the difficulties created by this emancipation. Undoubtedly freedom was given in a sudden moment of enthusiasm and in response to a violent and forcible demand, and it is obvious that full enfranchisement was prematurely afforded. But such methods will not right matters. Two wrongs do not make a right. The determination to keep black people in a state of ignorance, so as to exclude them from the right to vote, is unworthy and impossible. Lynching is not going to meet the situation either. Both are utterly unworthy methods of bullying a weak and maltreated race. The true solution is repatriation. Why talk of planting British Indians in Africa when so many expatriated Africans will colonise it far more satisfactorily? I admit that Liberia has not been a success so far. But I contend that limited repatriation wisely directed can be made a success. Some of the \'back wages\' of these black people in America might well be used for this purpose.

These treaties took two forms - those between Africans and Europeans, and bilateral agreements between the Europeans themselves. The African-European treaties were basically of two kinds. Firstly, there were the slave trade and the commercial treaties; these had generated friction, which in turn led to European political interference in African affairs. Secondly, there were the political treaties by which African rulers either purportedly surrendered sovereignty in return for protection, or undertook not to enter into treaty obligations with other European nations.\nThese political treaties were in vogue during our period. They were made either by representatives of European governments or by those of private organizations who later transferred them to their respective govern› ments. If a metropolitan government accepted them, the territories in question were usually annexed or declared a protectorate; if, on the other hand, it suspected their authenticity, or if it felt constrained by the vicissi› tudes of Weltpolitik to exercise caution, these treaties were used for bargaining purposes during the bilateral European negotiations. Africans, on the other hand, entered into these arrangements for a variety of motives, but particularly because of the interests of their people. In some cases, they desired treaty relations with Europeans because they hoped that the prestige of such a relationship would endow them with certain political advantages in dealing with their neighbours. Sometimes a weak African state would desire a treaty with a European power in the hope of using it to renounce allegiance to another African state that claimed sovereignty over it. An African sovereign would also desire a treaty in the hope of using it to keep recalcitrant subject states in line. And sometimes a treaty with one European nation was seen by some African states as a means of preserving their independence which was being threatened by other European nations.$^{42}$ Whatever was the case, the African-European political treaties played an important role in the final partition of Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.57, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > The Berlin West Africa Conference, 1884-5', 'content': ""In recognizing the Congo Free State, permitting territorial negotiations, and by laying down rules and regulations for the 'legal' appropriation of African territory, the European powers had arrogated to themselves the right of sanctioning the principle of sharing out and conquering another continent.

The first was the new interest which the Duke of Brabant, crowned a constitutional king (Leopold I) of the Belgians in 1865, proclaimed in Africa. This was signified by the so-called Brussels Geographical Conference which he convened in 1876 and which resulted in the setting up of the African International Association and the employment of H. M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

This classification came about as a result of the nationalist struggle for independence in Africa, as elsewhere in the world. Those involved in the movement tended to see themselves as heirs to a long tradition of struggle whose roots go back to the beginning of this century, if not earlier.

Put in these terms, this view is an attempt to use the standards of the present, with the aid of hindsight, to interpret the events of the past. In the colonial situation, those who resisted were described by colonial officials as short-sighted while those who collaborated were seen as far-sighted. Today, nationalist historians in East Africa con› demn so-called collaborators, especially chiefs, and praise resisters. 1\nAmong the resisters, there were also divisions.

Sir Edward was followed by Sir Travers Twiss, who argued it was impossible to demand fulfillment of the same conditions in the effecting of an occupation and in the assumption of a protectorate, seeing that in the former case complete sovereignty was the result of the act, while the essence of a protectorate was this—that it left internal sovereignty and jurisdiction untouched, and only established a right to control the foreign relations of the protected State. It was plain, therefore, that the protecting Power could not undertake to establish a jurisdiction of its own such as was required by the draft declaration in question. Then, again, the chief characteristic of a protectorate was that it reserved to the foreign Power a sovereignty in international relations, while leaving the protected State supreme in domestic matters. It would be a subversion of this principle to make the validity of a protectorate dependent on the establishment of a ""sufficient jurisdiction to secure order and respect for law and acquired rights,"" &c.\n\nSeveral other members also expressed opinions on the subject, none of them directly counter to the English contention; and ultimately, a sub-committee was appointed to reconstruct the draft declaration in the light of some of the objections that had been urged against it.\n\nMeanwhile, all the Powers, with the exception of Belgium, France, and Portugal, have either recognized or signified their intention of recognizing the International Association.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains.

If they were less farsighted, less fortunate or less well-advised, they would see their traditional enemies siding with the invader and would themselves assume an attitude of resistance, which could all too easily end in military defeat, the deposition of chiefs, the loss of land to the native allies of the occupying power, possibly even to the political fragmen› tation of the society or state ...

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Increased European pressures', 'content': ""As we have already mentioned, during the period under discussion East Africa was part of a large informal empire under British control. Towards the end of this period, however, the rise of Germany as a major Western power was beginning to increase the competition that already existed. Outside the East African sphere, tensions caused by this competition were already beginning to appear. When King Leopold called an international conference in Brussels in 1876 'to discuss methods of peaceful and co- operative action to develop legitimate commerce and attack the slave trade',$^{62}$ the rivalry was already appearing on the surface. The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo. The most significant action of the period was the British occupation of Egypt in 1882. For the British the action was justified because of the strategic position of Egypt (with the Suez Canal and the Nile) for British interests in India and East Africa, although East Africa was considered of less importance. But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year. In West Africa Germany and France were beginning to stand together to challenge the British position on the Niger. The 'high tide of imperialism' had begun to flow. When Bismark convened the Berlin Conference in November 1884, the process of partitioning Africa had already started. In East Africa Carl Peters had already arrived in Zanzibar under the auspices of his Gesellschaft für Deutsche Kolonisation (German Colonization Society) and had gone inland to negotiate treaties.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'Among the social effects of foreign rule on African society, the most immediately noticeable was the political one. Pre-existing African states, except for Liberia and, up to 1935, Ethiopia, lost most of their sovereignty and with it the right to participate in the affairs of the world community except indirectly through their new masters. Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute. The universal imposi› tion of European-planned taxes was certainly another disruptive colonial measure, but even the modest efforts made in the direction of what is today called modernization also remoulded local institutions.

The grand lesson of the slave trade era long driven home in West and Central Africa, and being learnt in East Africa in the course of the nineteenth century, was that the way to survive and perhaps even profit from the slave trade was to strengthen the structures and military basis of state power.\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, as we have noted in most parts of Africa, 'the political and economic structures ... seemed to have a certain fragility about them. There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority. In the words of K. Arhin and J. Ki-Zerbo describing the Voltaic regions: During the nineteenth century, political instability and population movements were widespread. Brutal massacres and secessionist move› ments were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority... Some notable exceptions notwithstanding, the frequency and extent of these conflicts grew and the tendency towards social dislocation was undoubtedly linked with the growing opportunities available to the peripheral powers and the rebels to obtain arms and use them to challenge the reigning chiefs. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.718, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'Implications of incorporation', 'content': 'There is no need to exaggerate the role of external forces in African statebuilding. The internal forces were the primary mechanism of political evolution and the existing logics of development account for most of the particular details. Furthermore states were constructed in this same era which were quite remote from the world-economy as, for example, the Rozvi.$^{35}$ Also it is quite obvious, by looking at the West African states, that there is an imperfect connection between participation in the slave-trade and state-formation. If the two went hand to hand for Dahomey and Oyo, in Benin we had the formation of a strong state without such participation, and the inverse was true for the Niger delta. 36 The point, however, is a different one. It is that involvement in the world-economy required political structures that ensured the functioning of the economy; its commerce, its production, its labour-force supply.\nThe outside pressure was to have such structures.$^{37}$ Where the existing structures performed the necessary functions, for whatever reason, there was little pressure to change them. But, of course, the involvement in the world-economy increased the economic importance to given internal producers of sympathetic political structures. It is the internal producers who pressed to change the structures.$^{38}$ This led to various kinds of turmoil, which were of limited benefit to other participants in the world-economy. The latter in turn pressed for political stabilization, which took the form of creating states which participated in and were therefore constrained by the interstate system.$^{39}$ Ultimately, as we know, this led in most of Africa to the creation of colonial states. The abolition of the slave trade was a crucial political and economic event in this process. As plantation slavery and the slave trade were phenomena deriving from the operation of the capitalist world-economy, so was the abolition of the slave trade and of plantation slavery. I do not wish here to re-open the question of the importance of the abolitionists as a pressure group in this process. They of course existed and were part of the process.

But, on the eve of the imposition of European colonial rule, there was no direct alien control of everyday economic activity on African soil. Such a situation came into being by a slow process after the loss of African sovereignty. The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer. Africans responded aggressively to the attempted destruction of their economic independence, as illustrated by some of the more famous anti-colonial resistances already discussed, such as the Hut Tax war in Sierra Leone, the Bailundu revolt in Angola, the MajïMajï wars in German East Africa and the Bambata rebellion in South Africa.\nAfricans witnessed the first physical evidence of a new economy in the form of road, rail and telegraph construction. Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure. Their followers were told to pull down telegraph posts and tear up railway tracks, as in the Niger/Senegambia region when the French military presence was first manifest in the 1880s and 1890s.$^{1}$ However, few roads or railways were of purely military interest; and the same railways which facilitated conquest were used for the extraction of groundnuts, cotton and so on.\nCoastal African economies were quickly reduced to dependent entities within the economies of the respective colonizing powers, while the interior peoples were usually the last to be brought into the network of produce collection, cash-crop cultivation and paid labour. Considerable expenditure was needed to provide certain African ports with deep berths and viable off-loading capacity;$^{2}$ but this was less onerous than the capital which had to be invested in arterial roads or railways penetrating the hinterland.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories.

Meanwhile, he properly organised the native forces, compelled those who had retired from the field to rejoin the camp, settled all disputes and differences amongst them, and inspired new spirit in them. And after a consultation between him and Major Cochrane, they agreed that, should the Ashantees not come to their terms, a simultaneous attack should be made with the regular forces and the native armies—numbering at least about 25,000 men—against the Ashantee force in Soedrue, and either gain a complete victory over them, or compel them to retire from our territory.

His Majesty commenced by declaring his peaceful intentions to the English Government, and then brought several charges against the Akims and Assins, who formerly were subjects of Ashanti, but now under British protection; the King wished that bygones should be bygones, and that the Governor should not listen to the advice of ill-disposed councillors, as he intended not to do the same; he apologised for not having effected the exchange before this time, as he had several customs to perform, and hoped that on the return of his ambassadors there will be good feelings between the two Governments.  \nThe Administrator expressed his delight at the peaceful tone of the King's letter, and said that he would take time to consider what reply he would give them after consulting with the other members of the Council.  \nThe question now arises, is the King of Ashanti sincere in""}, {'id': 2028, 'article_title': 'Cannibalism at New Calabar', 'full_section_title': 'Cannibalism at New Calabar', 'last_edit_date': '02-29-1871', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_04_1871#article-9', 'issue_date': '24_04_1871', 'content': 'We publish the following extract from the letter of a young townsman, dated February 29, 1871, who witnessed several of the incidents named: ""It may not generally be credited that cannibalism is still in existence in some of the oil rivers on the West Coast of Africa; however, such is the fact. On the 22nd February upwards of 400 of the New Calabar nation, with twelve war canoes, armed with cannon of various calibre, opened fire upon the Ecruka country, situated some sixty or seventy miles from the mouth of New Calabar River. This challenge to a pitched battle was not accepted, and King Amachree, not feeling inclined to invade the country, turned his attention to blockading the creeks, so as to intercept any of King Phibia\'s men who were returning from their fishing-stations. Unfortunately, he was in this manoeuvre too successful, as sixteen men and women fell into his hands. Two or three of this number were immediately murdered, cooked, and eaten in the canoes, in sight of the Ecruka tribe, who were afraid or unable to attempt rescue. The remaining prisoners were brought to Calabar on the 25th February, and there, after going through the rites and ceremonies usual on such occasions, were killed by hacking off their heads with hatchets. The bodies were then cut up into small portions and distributed to the different houses in the town to be cooked. In addition to the sixteen prisoners already mentioned, eight others were captured, who are supposed to be natives of Bonny, but as the Calabarites are not at war with the Bonny nation, the lives of these have for the present been spared. From the fact of their being captured while in the company of the Ecruka men, they were very naturally supposed to be in league with them. Moreover, one of the men took a solemn oath that the Bonny men were assisting the Ecrukas by lending canoes and supply them with ammunition. It now remains to be seen what Oko Jumbo and the other Bonny chiefs will say. If they deny all knowledge of the eight men, and can convince King Amachree that they are not his enemies, the palaver will be settled, and the men, of course, \'chopped\' (eaten). Supposing, on the other hand, they are unable to do this, Oko Jumbo will find it hard work to maintain his present position against the attacks of Ja Ja, of the Opobo River, on the one side, and King Amachree, who will no doubt prove himself a formidable antagonist, on the other.""—Sheffield Telegraph.'}, {'id': 2489, 'article_title': 'Meeting of the Ijebu Messengers with the Governor of Lagos', 'full_section_title': 'Meeting of the Ijebu Messengers with the Governor of Lagos', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_06_1873#article-13', 'issue_date': '30_06_1873', 'content': 'We are informed that Governor Berkley tried to show the messengers that as regards the King\'s demands of Palma and Leckie as his territory, and about escaped slaves, they were dwelling upon questions—one of which is that of slavery, &c.—which could not be at all approached by England.

Mr. J. E. Carlyle, of 23, Talbot-road, Bayswater, informs us that more recent information, up to January 2, has been received from Mr. Stewart, C.E., who is in charge of the construction of the road from Lake Nyassa to Lake Tanganyika, the scene of the recent encounter. This is of a more hopeful character. Mr. Stewart, with the aid of some British mechanics, &c., lately began this road, taking as a basis Chiwinda's village, some ninety miles to the west of the north end of the Lake Nyassa. He had also with him a number of civilized and Christianised natives from the south end of the Lake. The road is being formed by the African Lake Company. It is not a missionary enterprise, although working in co-operation with the missionaries. Chiwinda being inland, caravans to the Lake are necessary to bring up stores. Several of these had safely passed, but these were either personally conducted by white men, or were exclusively composed of the more civilized natives. On the last occasion there was no white man, and there were a number of rawer natives from Chiwinda's village. The disaster occurred at a village on the way, belonging to Mombwera, a chief. Mr. Stewart confirms the statement that nineteen are missing, eleven of them being the more civilized natives, eight being from Chiwinda, and four only escaping. As to the nineteen missing, Mr. Stewart is not certain that some of them may not have been enslaved by the slave-gangs who have lately penetrated into the district, and are using their influence against the Europeans. Mr. Stewart believes that the road party had been guilty of little or no provocation, though there may have been some pilfering as regards Chiwinda's men. They were suddenly and savagely attacked, and three killed in the presence of the chief. Chiwinda felt naturally outraged at the loss of his men, engaged, as they were, in the service of the Company. He let Mr. Stewart know that if they would not aid him in obtaining satisfaction, he would certainly fight them. An expedition was organized, mainly with the aid of the principal chief on the Rombushe River—other chiefs around also volunteering their services. Mr. Stewart was, however, most desirous that the reprisals should not be of a severe character. The tribe had ample time given them to escape, and one life only was lost in a skirmish. A number of huts, however, were burned, and a banana grove destroyed. That the retaliation was not severe, is evident from the desire since expressed by Mombwera to make peace with the white men, and to offer them cattle as compensation. Mr. Stewart has meanwhile retired from Chiwinda, transporting safely back all his goods to the Lake, leaving, however, some cloth to Chiwinda, and some gifts for the relatives of the massacred men. He thus escapes further entanglements with Chiwinda. Nothing daunted, he proposes resuming operations this month (April) or next, although at the north end of the Lake there are still collisions of rival chiefs which may prove harassing. He has wisely decided to make the Lake the next time the basis of his operations, beginning at Karonga. He will thus have his road behind him, and will not for a time need to engage many porters. Should he succeed in making this road, there will be a line of route, rivers, lakes, and roads, extending to about 2,000 miles, from Quelemane, on the Indian Ocean, by the Zambesi Shia and Lake Nyassa, to the northern extremity of Lake Tanganyika.""}, {'id': 5264, 'article_title': 'THE CONGO FREE STATE', 'full_section_title': 'THE CONGO FREE STATE', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1885#article-4', 'issue_date': '01_12_1885', 'content': 'The Portuguese are quietly organizing their recently acquired territory in this part.

As matters have come to such a crisis, perhaps you will allow me to lay before your readers some details of the whole matter in dispute, by which they may be better able to judge whether such arrest was really justified by the facts.\n\nAfter the famous Berlin Conference of 1884, it was arranged by the British authorities that some one should be sent out to the Oil Rivers to proclaim a Protectorate on behalf of Great Britain over the whole district; and accordingly a gentleman was sent out as Consul, who was empowered to sign a treaty with the native kings and chiefs of the various places, of which Opobo, where Ja Ja is King, was one. One of the conditions of the treaty which Ja Ja signed (Article 6) expressly prohibited strangers going to the interior markets; this condition being further substantiated by a letter from the Consul to Ja Ja; the effect and intention of this being to secure that the European agents should only obtain their goods from the interior through Ja Ja and his chiefs.\n\nAbout two years ago, owing to the depression in the oil trade, some of these agents agreed among themselves that the price of the oil and other native productions should be reduced; and Ja Ja accordingly was communicated with upon the subject, and he expressed his readiness to accept their terms; but that the ""topside"" (a general term among the traders there, meaning commission) should be allowed to him and his chiefs, as before. This the agents would not agree to; they were willing to continue the usual topside to Ja Ja himself, but not to his chiefs. Ja Ja remonstrated with them, and pointed out that Opobo was made by himself and his chiefs. Immediately a white flag was hoisted in five of the factories, which meant that they stop all further business with the natives. One of the firms concerned refused to agree to this suspension, and continued to trade as before.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1887#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Deputation to Lord Knutsford', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""As regards the colony of Gambia, it was but natural that British traders would object to give their colony and trade to France for what the French possessed between Pongas river and the Gaboon, as the French had only the Assinie and Porto Novo territory, both of little value. Besides, they expected our own people would keep the hinterland of the Gambia and not let the French hem them in. Again, if the exchange had been made, it would not have prevented the French getting behind us at Sierra Leone, the inland territory not being between the places named.\n\n""Then there is the Tabou territory on the Kroo coast. The real ruler of this place is an Englishman who has lived there for twenty years, and holds deeds of ownership of the land. This gentleman called at the Colonial Office years ago with the documents in question, and besought the authorities to take over the country. They refused, and when the matter was again brought up by the recent deputation they were told that the territory had been taken over by France.\n\n""Something of the same kind took place as regards the island of Matacong. At present it is owned by an Englishman, leased by an Englishman, and the owner was told the other day by Lord Knutsford that it was French territory.\n\n""You cite Liberia in your article as a place where a profitable trade may yet be done. Well, this is a poor solace. It is not creditable to a Government that its subjects should have to give up trading in its settlements and go into the colony of a neighbouring Government to make a living.\n\n""There is also the question of the Gold Coast settlement. We have not the assurance that the hinterland there has been secured to us. On the contrary, what may we not fear from the mission of M. Binger? Look what France is doing in West Africa. Railways at Konakry and St. Louis, spending £250,000 on a pier at Kotonu, near Lagos; all this apart from her numerous expeditions.\n\n""After all, the sum total of the whole question is this. We have a coast colony, and to feed that colony we should have the inland trade. The territory whence emanates this trade is suddenly taken away from our influence by a country whose interest is to divert it to its own colonies. We cannot get the inland territory under our own influence again, and our coast colony may become a seaport without a trade. What steps can we take to nullify the effect of the change and bring back the trade to the colony? Hitherto the Government has been looked up to for guidance, protection, and direction, but, in view of the interests which have been recently sacrificed, the African trade is determined to speak out unmistakably for itself in future, whatever Government may be in power.', 'last_edit_date': '1892-01-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_01_1892#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Progress on the West African Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The rivers are connected by a network of cross creeks, being indeed one delta; so from the Opobo Ja Ja\'s people found their way to the interior oil markets, and the oil trade of Opobo was established. The trade flourished, and Ja Ja was respected for his fair dealing and his great ability to govern his own people. Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets. Ja Ja was made prisoner by Consul Johnstone, and carried off to Accra. An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river. He will, however, be allowed an annual pension of £800 for life.\n\nThe principle having been laid down that Europeans may trade in the interior, it becomes imperative to assume definite authority over the district. The ""customs"" have been abolished, a uniform export duty of 2s. 6d. per ton being levied instead. As things stand, we make no pretence to the sovereignty of the country; we only constitute ourselves the final authority in matters of dispute between the natives and traders of whatever nationality, and debar our continental neighbours from proclaiming themselves masters of the country. Whether things will remain as they now are is the doubtful point; pretexts for occupation are so easily found when wanted that it would be rash to answer. Some tribe is reached who cannot understand dual control; they insist on customs, perhaps; are ""chastised"" by the Consul; they retaliate, and finally an occupation is proclaimed. This is the danger to which we are exposed, for the destruction of the natives means loss to the traders and the abandonment of commerce.

Since the abolition of the export of slaves, these localities have been the sites of trading stations, palm oil being the chief article of export. The traders have been, with few exceptions, British, and the capitalists mostly Liverpool merchants. The natives allowed trading hulks to be anchored and commerce conducted on payment of fixed sums, known as ""comey."" Bonny, Brass, and Old Calabar are among the oldest of these trading ports, the native chiefs being also the native traders. They possessed numerous slaves who were sent with merchandise to the interior markets to collect oil, which was brought to the stations and sold to the whites.

Of his enemies the most powerful was Oko Jumbo, who lost no opportunity to humiliate him. The Europeans could only let matters take their course; they regretted constant fighting of Oko Jumbo and Ja Ja, but the relations between the Europeans and natives being strictly commercial, nothing could be done. Suffering reverses, Ja Ja was forced to fly with the remnant of his people after great slaughter at the hands of Oko Jumbo. He collected his scattered family, dependants, and slaves, and made his escape to the Opobo river.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs. Although one of the reports said that the Natives would rise against the Germans and drive them out of the river, it was not believed by the English that anything of the kind would be attempted, as the Germans a few years ago gave the Natives a lesson of their strength which they are not likely to forget.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The trading operations of Europeans in West Africa are carried on after the following manner: The trader selects a site suitable—generally by the side of a river or creek, or along the seashore—and comes to terms with the owner of the soil or the native chief of the district for the leasing of the land, the natives retaining a dislike to alienating any part of their country.

The conduct of the masters and seamen of these trading vessels was often outrageous. The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment. With the missionaries it can be imagined how these ruffians came in conflict; and so angry were they at the prospect of the missionaries protecting their victims, or interfering with them, that they bribed and frightened the native chiefs, and used every effort to prevent the missionaries obtaining any hold on the country. The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills. Ivory has all but disappeared. Ebony and other woods are increasing in volume, and cocoa quickly rising into importance, as well as rubber.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

L. Cameron, R.N., C.B. The Earl of Dundonald was in the chair.\n\nCommander Lovett Cameron, in the course of his opening remarks, said the slave trade went on all round the continent of Africa, and commerce had gone on with it. Our trade with the West Coast of Africa had gone on since the time of the Tudors. For centuries that trade was in slaves, and its increase was slow; but after several blows had been struck at that trade—among others by the liberation of slaves in the West Indian Islands, in America, and in Cuba—instead of their being any injury done to our commerce, our trade with the West Coast of Africa increased by leaps and bounds. It was only in 1850 or shortly after that we attacked a great nest of slave dealers in Lagos, and in 1861 it was made a British colony. Up to that time there had been no trade there except in slaves; but last year the trade of Lagos amounted to £357,831 imports, and £538,980 exports. And yet only thirty-eight years ago that place was of absolutely no value to us for legitimate commerce. On the Gold Coast slavery had been practically abolished by the British Government, but yet there was a good deal still existing owing to the native customs of the people. Even if the export of slaves from Africa was prevented entirely, the internal trade in them would still be enormous.\n\nFormerly the slave trade was subsidiary to the ivory trade, but when porters were no longer wanted for the latter, the former remained, only the men were killed and the women and children carried away. It had been said that domestic slavery must be allowed, and that was a very difficult question to settle. In his opinion, we should, as in India, abolish the legal status of slavery, but should not rout out all the households where no complaint was made. As long as domestic slavery existed there would be a market for slaves. We must have nothing to do with slavery; while the slave trade continued it was impossible for legitimate commerce to go on as it should! If the slave trade were done away with, they would find that all other trade would flourish.\n\nIn answer to questions Commander Lovett Cameron said he had avoided speaking of the Germans for diplomatic reasons.\n\nHe had a plan for the total abolition of slavery in Africa, which he hoped to explain shortly. It was, in brief, to establish a barricade across the country by the way of the lakes, and to get authority to maintain order on that line.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, on February 26, presided over a large meeting, held in Exeter Hall, when two African explorers, Commander Cameron and Captain Hore, were announced to speak.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-03-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_03_1889#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ENGLAND AND HER WEST AFRICAN COLONIES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Turning to the question of the political administration of the Colonies at the present time, he enumerated the different systems of government prevailing in the various British Colonies in Africa, and said that the great benefits derived by the Colonies from their annexation to England, whose constitutional monarchy was the most stable system of representative government to be found in the whole world, were conspicuous and great. England had extended to her West African dependencies the privileges of British legitimate trade and commerce, which was a powerful vehicle for the advancement of civilisation.\n\nBringing forward the commercial advancement of the West African Colonies, he said the question had often been asked, ""Do the Colonies pay?"" He could answer with an emphatic affirmative. In 1837 the total external trade of England with all the Colonies was £28,341,471; it was now nearly £300,000,000, thus showing an increase of about ten times. The British shipping in connexion with the Colonies in 1837 was 3,677,975 tons; in 1885 it was 56,611,075 tons. The English Customs returns reckoned the exports to the Colonies in 1837 at £11,283,363; and this had since risen to £54,545,553. Her Majesty\'s Colonies, he said, furnished more than a quarter of the whole world\'s annual supply of gold. He then referred to the commercial geography of the British African Colonies, gave the value of their exports and imports, and reviewed the trade generally. The construction of a railway to the interior of Africa from Lagos was a recent proposition and a new feature in the history of the West African Colonies. It was obvious that Africa was, or would be, the only continent open for the future expansion of British manufacture; in such a case the interior would play an important part. He maintained, with eminent authorities on the subject, that by native agency alone, under foreign supervision necessarily, could tropical Africa be gradually and definitely developed on any permanent basis, and that the negro should be educated industrially and otherwise with the generous help of Europe and America. Whatever was accomplished by native agency, England certainly should carry the credit of effecting such accomplishment in the civilisation of Africa. It was beyond doubt that the English were acknowledged the best colonisers; and the marked consideration invariably shown by them to the people whom they undertook to govern, the extreme liberty and entire privileges of a British subject extended to every native, and the judicious caution characteristic of the policy of the British Government had altogether won for England this success and the preference to all other civilised nations.

The General History of Africa highlights King Behanzin's confrontational stance against French colonial encroachment, mobilizing troops in response to French occupation and economic threats. This led to a treaty recognizing French possession of Cotonou while securing an annuity for Behanzin, reflecting strategic negotiation rather than outright submission. The text emphasizes that many African rulers opted for alliances over collaboration, underscoring the strategic deception and complexity in these interactions. Dahomey's transition from a slave-based economy to palm oil trade further illustrates adaptability and strategic economic shifts in response to colonial pressures. Complementing this, The African Times articles describe the King of Dahomey's attempts to establish favorable relations with Great Britain, such as the enthusiastic reception of Commodore Wilmot and the symbolic elevation of Queen Victoria's portrait, indicating a strategic alignment with a powerful European nation. The articles also mention the King's envoys negotiating peace in France and report instances of deception, like a relative being captured in place of the dethroned King Behanzin, highlighting strategic deception. Additionally, the British and French responses, including military interventions and blockades, reflect the complex power dynamics and strategic maneuvers by both Dahomeyan royalty and colonial powers.

This is evident when he mobilized his troops in response to French occupation and economic threats, leading to a treaty that recognized French possession of Cotonou but also secured an annuity for Behanzin. This reflects a strategic negotiation rather than outright submission, highlighting the nuanced and tactical engagements African leaders had with European powers. Furthermore, the text discusses the broader context of African rulers' strategies, emphasizing that many opted for alliances rather than collaboration, a distinction that underscores the strategic deception and complexity in these interactions. The narrative of Dahomey's transition from a slave-based economy to palm oil trade underlines the adaptability and strategic economic shifts in response to changing colonial pressures.

This move constituted a serious blow to the economic interests of Abomey. In 1889, the heir to the throne, Prince Kondo, informed the governor of the RiviŁres de Sud, Bayol, that the Fon people would never accept such a situation. In February 1890, Bayol ordered the occupa› tion of Cotonou and the arrest of all the Fon notables in the town. Prince Kondo, who had begun his reign in December 1889 under the name of Behanzin, reacted by mobilizing his troops. At the time, Abomey had a permanent army which, in peacetime, numbered 4000 men and women. In wartime military service was compulsory for all males, supported by the Amazons, who were dreaded female warriors.\nThe French garrison was attacked at dusk, at the same time as part of the army dispatched to the region of Porto Novo set about destroying the palm trees. According to Behanzin, those economic counter-measures quickly induced the French to sue for peace. On 3 October, Father DorgŁre presented himself in Abomey with proposals for peace. In return for the recognition of Cotonou as a French possession and the right of the French to levy custom duties and station a garrison of troops there, the French were to pay Behanzin an annuity of 20000 francs. The king accepted these terms and the treaty was signed on 3 October 1890. However, to defend the rest of his state, the king started to modernize his army. Between January 1891 and August 1892 he purchased, '1,700 rapid-firing rifles, six Krupp cannon of various bore, five machine-guns, 400,000 assorted cartridges and a large quantity of shell'$^{31}$ from German firms operating in Lome."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The structure of Volume VII', 'content': 'A great majority of African rulers, then, did opt for the defence of their sovereignty and independence.

Those African rulers who have been mistakenly termed collaborators were those who thought that the best way of safeguarding their sovereignty or even regaining the sovereignty that they might have lost to some African power previous to the arrival of the Europeans was not to collaborate but rather to ally with the European invaders. A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation. But as we have seen, the Africans were all faced with the question of surrendering, retaining or regaining their sovereignty.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century.

The Anglo-French convention of August 1863 actually agreed on a partition of the area between the two powers, with the Yewa river, about 20 km west of what became the border in 1889, as the agreed boundary. The French and British declarations of protectorates in the area between 1862 and 1863 did not enjoy official ratification and had to be abandoned in the 1870s.

The French conquest of Dahomey in 1892, the AngloFrench Partition of Borgu in 1895, the extension of British rule over the rest of Yorubaland and their conquest of Benin in 1897 must be seen as the logical conclusion of the Anglo-French rivalry of the 1860s, itself provoked by the pre-existing unities of the hinterland of the ports the European powers tried to control on the coast.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The state of African preparedness', 'content': 'What was the attitude of the Africans themselves to the establishment of colonialism, involving as it did such a fundamental change in the nature of the relationships that had existed between them and the Europeans over the preceding three hundred years?

The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy. Asante must remain as of old at the same time to remain friendly with all white men. I do not write this in a boastful spirit but in the clear sense of its meaning ... the cause of Asante is progressing and there is no reason for any Asante man to feel alarm at the prospects or to believe for a single instant that our cause has been driven back by the events of the past hostilities. 2\nIn 1895, Wobogo, the Moro Naba, or King of the Mossi (in modern Upper Volta), told the French officer, Captain Destenave: I know that the whites wish to kill me in order to take my country, and yet you claim that they will help me to organize my country. But I find my country good just as it is. I have no need of them. I know what is necessary for me and what I want: I have my own merchants: also, consider yourself fortunate that I do not order your head to be cut off. Go away now, and above all, never come back. 3', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The changing balance of power', 'content': ""Similarly, most African leaders were very suspicious of European missionaries. Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The collapse of Old Oyó', 'content': ""Although independence from Oyo had been the policy of all Dahomey monarchs, beginning with Kpengla (1774-89), it was not until the opening years of the reign of Gezo (1818-58) that the Oyo imperial yoke was repudiated.

The European anti-slave trade movement hit the state's economy, based as it was almost solely on the slave trade. However, Gezo's economic policy was to continue to respond to the demand for slaves from Portuguese dealers while at the same time responding to the stimulus of the export trade in palm oil as the ultimate substitute for slave exports.$^{22}$ These signs of the relative political and economic strength of Dahomey were becoming visible at the same time as symptoms of advanced decline were becoming increasingly apparent in Old Qyo.

Its adjustment to changing times was noticeable from the mid-century when, under the influence of a French trading firm, Victor RØgis, King Gezo (c. 1818-58) of Dahomey was persuaded to intensify the trade in palm oil, first as a supplement to the export of slaves and eventually as the dominant factor in the state's export economy.$^{41}$ The transition from slave to 'legi› timate' trade meant a corresponding increase in the need to retain war captives as labour for the maintenance and expansion of the palm oil industry. Slaves also came to be used more for transporting goods from the interior to the coast and vice-versa than as commodities for export. By the time of the French conquest of 1892-4, the foundation of Dahomey's new economy - the monoculture of palm produce - had already been laid.

The British had clashed with King William Pepple of Bonny as early as 1854, when they exiled him to Fernando Po, Ascension, Sierra Leone and London. They used disturbances caused by local feuds as an excuse. In 1887 they could find no such excuse when they removed Jaja of Opobo for his opposition to direct British trade in the Imo river valley. The rulers of Nembe (Brass), lying on the main Nun estuary of the Niger, were involved in quarrels between exploring and trading British expeditions and local peoples from the 1830s when British citizens got killed or shot at. The final showdown came in 1895, when the Nembe attacked the major depot of the Royal Niger Company at the port of Akassa and destroyed it. This was in protest against the Company's attempt to establish monopoly trade all the way up from Akassa in the delta to Lokoja at the Niger-Benue confluence.

He naturally chose, therefore, not to collaborate but to ally with the French. Surely only those historians who are not aware of the problems with which Tofa was confronted at that time, or who deny the African any initiative or an awareness of his own interests, or who see the whole issue from a Eurocentric viewpoint, would describe Tofa as a collaborator.

Each country or empire was populated by numerous ethno-cultural groups or nations who were as different from each other as, say, the Italians are from the Germans or the French.

Indeed, as will be demon› strated in some of the chapters of this volume, the nature of African reactions and responses to colonialism was determined not only by the ethno-cultural and political situation with which the Africans were con› fronted but also by the very nature of the socio-economic forces at work in the particular society at the time of the confrontation, and the nature of its political organization.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Only few of the colonial administrators seemed to have understood how to manage the uneasy relationship which existed between the 'traditional' and the new African elites on the one hand, and between these two sets of elites and the colonial regimes on the other.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British.

It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""Yet this was not what the European colonial administrators actually intended. Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'However, we find that even in the Muslim emirates of Northern Nigeria where it would appear there was a harmony of interests between the colonial power and the emirs, the union between the European and indigenous administrative systems was never organic. The result was that in some aspects of the life of a colony such as the purely secular the two systems could work hand in hand, while in some others they would work independently and, sometimes, at cross purposes.\nOne other social impact of foreign rule which was noticeable quite early in the colonial period was the general depression of the status of Africans. Colonialism superimposed on the pre-existing class structure of the continent at least an extra layer of leaders and pacesetters. In East Africa where it encouraged Asian immigration, colonialism in fact superimposed two classes. In each colony Europeans had the monopoly of political, economic and educational power, except in East Africa where a fraction of the economic power fell into the hands of Asians. In this situation the Africans became the underprivileged and looked up to the Europeans, and at times to the Asians, for leadership and example.\nThis structure of social relationship was shored up with a bogus racial theory which sought to arrange the different branches of the human family in a hierarchical order of civilization with the Africans (the Negroes) occupying the bottom of the ladder while the Europeans (whites) occupied the top. In Southern Africa, in particular, where white settlers found themselves locked in conflict with numerically superior Bantu peoples, the racial theory was especially stringent, with the authority of the Holy Bible being wrongly used to reinforce the presumed social implications of pseudo-Darwinism.

Our correspondence from Dahomey shows us, however, that the King has not accepted this reply of the Commodore as a final decision against him, but has applied directly by letter to Her Majesty\'s Government with the same object. In the article in our May number before alluded to we exposed the error and inconsistency of such a refusal as had been given to the King, and endeavoured once again to show how much that change which we so desire for Dahomey and Ashantee might possibly be forwarded by bringing some of the chief men of those countries into immediate personal contact with our advanced civilisation and all the humane institutions to which the blessed precepts of the Gospel of Peace have given rise among us. There is nothing more necessary to be shown to the authorities of those barbarous countries than the value which we attach to human life; and that although unhappily wars have not ceased among so-called Christian nations, human life is, except upon the battle-field, regarded as a sacred thing, in no case to be wantonly taken away, and in all cases to be hedged round by the supreme authority with all possible protections. We do not know what may be the decision of our Government, and what answer may be sent to the King of Dahomey. We have reason, however, to believe that the arguments put forward by us have not been without effect in modifying opinions in quarters where opposition to the King of Dahomey\'s wishes was known to exist. There is consequently reason to hope that a favourable answer may be accorded, at least to the extent of meeting the King\'s wishes that some of his chiefs should come over to this country, by offering those facilities without which it would be difficult, if not impossible, for them to do so. This, and a formal reception of such envoys by Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, are two very different things. If the latter could by any possibility be construed into an approval of, or even into a cessation of protest against, those horrible barbarities by which Dahomey is polluted, especially in those superstitious ""Customs"" in which human life is so wantonly destroyed, we should say at once that such envoys should not be admitted, either formally or informally, to the Royal presence; but if, as we think there is reason to believe, the personal displeasure of our Sovereign at such atrocities, pronounced by herself in presence of those envoys, might have the effect of inducing the King to put an end at once and for ever to his slave wars and to those appalling ""Customs"" for which Dahomey has become so infamously distinguished, we do venture to express the hope that in the event of the envoys arriving here, some means may be devised by which they may thus become assured of Her Majesty\'s abhorrence of things in which the Kings of Dahomey have delighted, and that Her Majesty considers those things in which they have gloried as incompatible with the existence of any friendly understanding, or interchange of courtesies between herself and him. We do think that some means may be devised by which such a Royal Christian effort might be made in the cause of humanity and of Christian civilisation in Africa without any sacrifice of Royal dignity. The end in view is really a great one. The cessation of slave-hunting wars and of ""Customs"" in Dahomey, and the entry of that country, however feeble at first its steps may be, into the ranks of the world\'s advancing Christian civilisation, would have a great effect on the surrounding countries. A new way would be opened through Dahomey into the interior of Africa. And as the Dahoman Government has long since shown itself alive to the importance of good roads between its principal places, more might possibly be done within a short time in that than in any other native African country in establishing improved communications between the coast and the interior. The visit of the Dahoman envoys to this country, and their judicious reception and entertainment here, are therefore much to be desired. It would be absurd, of course, to bring them over at this time of the year, when they would be exposed to the rigours of winter; but we hope that such an answer may be given to the King\'s application, and such instructions be issued and arrangements made, as may lead to the presence of those men among us some time in the months of May or June of next year.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-09-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_09_1866#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'OPERATIONS AGAINST DAHOMEY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We purposely resisted the temptation to comment on the late news from the Coast, that Sir William Hewett had asked for 500 European troops, 1st West India Regiment, and 600 Houssas, for an invasion of Dahomey; but the frequent London Correspondent of the Standard in this matter of Dahomey, a former West Coast official, having indited a long letter on the subject, some brief remarks on our part seem to be necessary. We think this correspondent takes an exaggerated view of the fighting resources of Dahomey, of the mortal peril of the European detenus there, and of the reckless character of King Gelélé. Affect what he may, this wretched thing of a King will be too wise to cut himself off from all possibility of future reconciliation with Great Britain, which he would do by murdering the Europeans now within his power, as we presume a preliminary summons would be made, in which the King would be distinctly informed that in the event of his injuring those persons, he would open a gulf between himself and the British that could only be closed up by his own dead body. There are some observations, however, in the letter which are so much in keeping with views we have expressed with regard to the Ashanti War and the Dahoman one, should it take place, that we have pleasure in reproducing them. He says, most justly, ""If, however, our troops do intend pushing on to Abomey and giving King Gelélé a lesson, we trust that a more effectual one will be administered than in the case of his neighbour of Ashanti. It will not be enough if we march through the town with colours flying, driving a frightened herd of women and children before us, and finally set fire to a few thatched mud huts, and then hurry back to the coast. Gelélé, should danger menace him, will, in all probability, take to the bush, and, if such should be the case, we ought not to retire until he has been dragged from his concealment, and brought face to face with the commander of the expedition."" The only modification we should make in the above is that the lesson we should give to Gelélé should not stop at anything short of the breaking up of that Power which, so long as it continues to exist, will never cease to offer up its hecatombs of victims at the behest of the sanguinary superstitions which have made Dahomey so odious to all civilized peoples. The concluding remarks we, of course, endorse, since they are in favour of a policy that we have advocated from the first hour in which we heard of the new Gold Coast Colony being proclaimed: ""Finally, we would again urge the necessity there exists of forming a continuous coast-line of British territory from the Assinee River to Lagos. Until this happy event becomes consummated, the traders of the West Coast will ever be subjected to the capricious treatment of petty kinglets, while our revenue will be defrauded by the smuggling, which such gaps render only too easy of performance.""

We are glad to remark that the British Government have firm opinions as to the policy to be pursued with reference to the King of Dahomey. Some anti-slavery journals appear to deprecate the use of force towards that monarch. They think that persuasion and entreaty should be brought to bear on him, with a view to induce him to desist from his practices of sacrificing human beings and engaging in slave-hunts. Persuasion, argument, and entreaty, have been repeatedly used on this present King of Dahomey and his predecessors, and used in vain. These kings tell us that it is the custom of their nation to hunt for slaves and to sacrifice human beings. He who is king is obliged to do these things. It is with him just as much a duty as the abiding by the advice of responsible ministers is with the Sovereign of Great Britain. If he abstained from these practices, his subjects would turn him out, and set up another man in his place, who would carry them out in accordance with immemorial usage. In order to put down these barbarous practices, only one course will avail—to use physical force. The British Government must say to the Dahomians, \'Sir, you are unwholesome in your habits and troublesome in your ways and practices. You won\'t live and let live. You go about kidnapping and killing people who never harmed you—who don\'t even know you. You prevent commerce, you hinder civilization, you create misery and desolation, you break up hundreds of thousands of happy families. This will not do. The world really can\'t get on in this manner. We have spoken to you, we have reasoned with you, we have entreated you—nay, we have even offered you money to leave off troubling your neighbours. Well, you are obstinate, you are perverse; you won\'t listen to anything; you will continue killing, kidnapping, and plundering, for no other reason than because you like it. Now we are resolved to put an end to your proceedings. You shall keep the peace in future. You shall no longer be a bugbear, a nuisance, a terror and a scourge to all surrounding nations.

We do not mean that they would proceed to greater extremities in their horrible excesses and barbarous despotism than in the past; but that the time would come when the civilized countries of Europe, and Great Britain in especial, would rouse themselves from their inertia as regards Dahoman atrocities and outrages, and take some effective steps for curbing that savage will in which they have originated. The late visit of the British squadron under Commodore Sir William Hewett to the waters of Whydah, his inquiry into reported outrages committed at that place by the local authorities of the King of Dahomey upon the persons of certain British and French subjects employed in mercantile affairs there, and his imposition of a fine of 500 puncheons of oil, equivalent to the sum of £6,000, to be enforced by blockade if not paid before the end of June next, may be regarded as the first letters of “the handwriting on the wall” foretelling the destruction of a system the devilish action of which, both externally and internally, is at the present time a standing insult to humanity. It is the more significant of “the handwriting on the wall” by a supreme Divine Power, that this first step in the right direction by Great Britain as regards Dahomey should have been made, and most righteously made, by a British naval officer, after consultation with the Governor-in-Chief of the Gold Coast Colony, without any previous communication with, or any direct instructions from, Her Majesty’s Government, at the very time when the Government of France, acting under the malefic influence and representations of the old Marseilles slave-trade interests, should have made difficulties about the acquisition of Gambia, which it has so long and so mightily desired, because it was called upon, as one of the conditions, to relinquish any supposed claims it might have upon a worthless old fort at Whydah, formerly used by French slave-dealers as a slave depôt, and since as mercantile stores. It is, of course, only a logical sequence to what has been done at other parts of the West Coast of Africa, the so-called oil rivers and elsewhere, that the commander of a British squadron should thus inquire into outrages and injuries inflicted by native authorities on British merchants and their employés, impose and levy fines, and stop the trade of the place until those fines were paid. But the present is the first occasion on which this wholesome discipline has been brought to bear upon his Majesty of Dahomey, and we hope from it some very salutary results. Up to the time of our writing there has not been any intelligence received as to the emotions and intentions of the King that may have found expression in words or deeds when he heard of this fine of 500 puncheons of oil, and a blockade if it be not paid at a certain time. He was absent from his capital, engaged with his forces in their annual raid in the Egba countries, mention of which is made in our Abeokuta and Lagos news,—raids which ought not any longer to be permitted by Great Britain, as the interests of her settlement at Lagos are grievously injured thereby,—raids that may be effectually prevented by the cutting off from the King of Dahomey of those supplies of ammunition and other warlike stores which he receives through Whydah. But we fully expect to hear that one of his Majesty’s earliest commands has been the sacrifice of those Whydah authorities who committed the outrages complained of (and inquired into by Sir William Hewett) in their endeavours to satisfy the royal greed, which, as is well known to those acquainted with affairs on the West Coast of Africa, is insatiate, and ever looking to Whydah for renewed supplies. Next, we expect he will offer apologies, and point to his victims, the sacrificed and murdered authorities, as proof that all such deeds had been opposed to his principles, orders, and desires. But this will not do. Not one penny or one gallon of oil of the fine imposed by Sir William Hewett ought to be or can be remitted. The decision of a British authority in this matter—a decision arrived at after due inquiry—must be upheld by Her Majesty’s Government as absolute and...', 'last_edit_date': '1876-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'DAHOMEY: ITS KING AND PEOPLE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The King of Dahomey has not realized the expectations we last month hazarded respecting him. Those expectations were formed on the supposition that he might possess some few grains of common sense, which would place vividly before his mental vision the dangers of collision between an earthen pot and a sledge hammer wielded by an arm of power. It seems to be now past dispute that, instead of disowning the acts of the brutal authorities at Whydah, who showed themselves to be fit servants to such a master, he has put a bold front on the matter, and sent the insolent message that ""he will pay the Commodore in powder and bullets if he will come up to Abomey."" This is the language that might be expected only from a doomed idiot, vapouring among the spiritless slaves by whom he may be surrounded, and who have worshipped him as almost a god, until he believes himself to be quite one. It is clearly full time that both King and people should be undeceived by coming in rude contact with something more than a few European trading clerks and agents, who, naturally enough, in the interests of their trade, submit, uncomplainingly, to everything short of actual plunder and brutal violence. Our opinions and feelings respecting the frantic iniquity of Dahomey are so strong, and our conviction that it is the imperative duty of Great Britain, as the real protecting Power on the West Coast of Africa, to put a final end to its enormities as being a daily insult to humanity, is so unalterable, that all we can say in reply to the braggart King is that we hope he will continue in his present frame of mind, and not be moved to feigned repentance by the blockade of his sea-ports. We do not wish him to repent, and thus save himself and his authority from destruction—unless his repentance should go so far (which it never would do) as to secure his faithful acquiescence in British demands, that he should never henceforth make any inroads into Egba territories in search of victims for his atrocious festivals, and that those festivals of blood should be entirely put an end to. The earth has groaned long enough under this blood-thirsty monster, and the devilish system that he at this time represents. That system is incurable by any other means than the entire destruction of the Power with which it is identified, and of which it is an inseparable part. The late King, and the present also, more than once declared to Europeans who have been on missions to Abomey, that even were he desirous of doing so, he could not discontinue that perpetual series of human sacrifices in which his people delight; that his prestige would be gone, and that he in his turn would be a victim if he ceased to justify by deeds his title of ""Man-slayer."" There is possibly truth in this. The people, like their King, are accustomed to sniff the, to them, intoxicating odour of the reeking blood of victims slaughtered before their eyes, and would object to be deprived of a gratification they have so long enjoyed. Under such circumstances there is only one way of purifying the horribly polluted atmosphere of Dahomey, and that is by bringing a superior force to bear upon King, people, and institutions. As already stated, we have ourselves always held the opinion that it was the duty of a civilized Christian Power such as Great Britain to interfere in the interests of humanity. There are now other interests, in addition to those of mere humanity, urging and impelling to the work. Not only has one of her subjects been grievously maltreated, but the financial interests of the Gold Coast Colony are very prejudicially interfered with by the action of Dahomey as a marauding State. The yearly armed expeditions into the Egba territories, even up to the immediate neighbourhood of Abeokuta, in quest of plunder and victims for sacrifice in the ""Customs,"" inflict very great injury not only on the industrious Egba agriculturists, but also, as a necessary result, on the revenues of Lagos. There is an annual scare in the Egba territories. Farms are deserted, the people take refuge in Abeokuta, and their property is wasted and destroyed. We feel sure that we do not exaggerate when we say that were those marauding inroads to cease, and to cease at the absurd certainty that there will not be any renewal of them, agricultural industry will take so great a development in the Egba countries that the production would be doubled, with corresponding advantage to the', 'last_edit_date': '1876-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1876#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.75, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'lightly undertaken.

Of the ultimate result of the French expedition, if undertaken with a due regard to the exceptional character of the warfare to be waged, there can be no real doubt: but if at the outset the French were to suffer a reverse, its effect upon the Dahomeyans can only be to enormously increase the difficulties in the way of a satisfactory settlement.

About the period that the Rev. William West, the superintendent of the Wesleyan Mission on the Gold Coast, was at Coomassie on a visit to the King, in company with the Rev. John Osco Ansah (an Ashantee prince) and Mr. Ghartey, a report was brought to his Majesty that a woman in a neighbouring village had made use of his great oath without sufficient cause. Quaku Duah at once despatched his executioner with his staff to the said village with orders (I need not say *strict or positive orders*, as in Coomassie all orders are positive and irrevocable) to slay every man, woman, child, sheep, goat, dog, fowl, and living creature therein, and to raze the place to the ground, and scatter salt over the ruins. *These orders were executed literally.* For the truth of this I refer to the three gentlemen named above.

It is almost beyond belief how any individual out of the precincts of a lunatic asylum could take up his pen and deliberately scribble off for publication in a respectable journal—in THE most respectable journal in the world—as genuine facts, what he is perfectly conscious are merely counterfeit facts, manufactured on his own premises. The *Times* ought to resent this insult by exposing him. It is no excuse for this person that he received his information from his cook or his butler. An individual who holds a high and responsible office under the Government of one of Her Majesty\'s foreign possessions, should be more than usually careful to ascertain that the assertions which he is about to put forth to the world in black and white, so that they cannot be recalled, are of that truthful nature that nothing could upset them. If this letter can be satisfactorily traced to the one suspected of being its author, then it will behove his Grace the Secretary of State for the Colonies to be very careful with regard to the official reports he receives from Cape Coast.\n\nThe truth respecting the ""Ocrah"" is this: An Ocrah is a domestic slave, generally a purchased slave, who, by good conduct, has acquired the confidence of his master or of her mistress. There are male Ocrahs, and there are also female Ocrahs, the latter more properly called Crabahs. They are to be found, not only in the palaces of kings, but in the household of anybody and everybody who is wealthy enough or foolish enough to purchase a slave for the purpose. The Ocrah may sometimes be the friend of his master, and the Crabah of her mistress, but is not by any means necessarily so. The probability is, that he does possess the confidence of his master, and she of her mistress, for neither would have been selected had they not evinced, whilst young, unusual capabilities for the performance of the ordinary domestic duties attached to their office. The number of Ocrahs and Crabahs in one household vary according to the wealth or the folly of the master or mistress. The King of Ashantee has in his establishment a staff of upwards of forty Ocrahs, the chief of whom is a fat eunuch, ""Ocrah Cherry"" by name.\n\nPerhaps ""An African"" will be good enough to inform us to which of them he refers when he talks of the Ocrah, the soul, counsellor, officer, adviser, friend, and companion of his ""old correspondent,"" Quaku Duah; or does he wish his audience to infer that these forty ""souls"" form a kind of privy council, without whose advice and consent the king dare not act?', 'last_edit_date': '1863-10-14', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1863#article-25', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.718, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Friend to the King of Dahomey', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I cannot close this letter without mentioning at least one circumstance regarding the late King of Dahomey, which was related to me on two different occasions by two trustworthy individuals who had visited Dahomey half-a-dozen times, and were great allies with the King.

Now, I should say that one whose religion would not deter him from committing a crime which I believe to be unparalleled would not hesitate to order the slaughter of any number of his helpless dependents. Everybody knows that he often does so, and every honest man who knows it will also candidly admit it.\n\nI have now a very few words more to add. I would respectfully caution the British public from attaching too much importance or faith to the tales of writers who, like ""An African,"" have had no personal experience of the men or things they enlarge upon, and whose knowledge thereof is derived from fifth-rate sources. Government officials who come out to the Gold Coast for a couple of years or less, who seldom move outside the Castle at Cape Coast, and who glean their information on all they intend to write about from their boys or from ignorant people of the lowest class (who just ""look in"" to get a glass of the white newsmonger\'s gin), cannot be expected to furnish the public with literary food of a healthy quality. So far as actual experience of matters goes, King Badahung is just as competent to put forth an opinion respecting the existing disputes between the Poles and Russians, or between the Northern and Southern States of America, as his ""friend,"" ""An African,"" is to undertake the task he has attempted.\n\nThis individual (always supposing his identity to be established beyond dispute, which, in point of fact, it is) very recently wrote to a friend of his at Cape Coast to announce his impending return to his post in almost these words: ""I am returning, not because I am obliged, or because I have any affection for the place, but I have a game to play, and, by Jove, I\'ll come and play it out too, in spite of all obstacles."" No doubt this letter is his first card. The second, I strongly suspect, will be to endeavour to oust from office, through intrigue, one who is the only bar to the well-known object of his ambition; but unless the remaining cards are higher, and much better played, the probability is he will find himself loo\'d to a heavy amount.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-10-14', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1863#article-25', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.766, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE AFRICAN KINGS TRANSPORTED BY THE LATE GOVERNOR USSHER.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""gold dust, equal to 720£.

The mere eating of fetish for an oath by the Accras and Djuabins, on the arrival of the latter at Accra—a law or practice observed for so very many years, and recognized by the preceding Governors as a custom of the protectorate kings and chiefs, with foreigners who seek to lodge in the protectorate as friends—was misrepresented to Governor Freeling as a scheme and plot inciting to war with the Ashantees, for which every now and then these poor harmless personages were disgracefully troubled. We, of course, greatly blame the Downing-street authorities for sending out as officers men of the stuff daily imported into this country, who will not afford to be at their own expense here for their meals and drink, but board on others, to save their salaries to spend when at home; which renders them, whatever may be their rank and position, mere tools in the hands of such natives as Mr. —, men who, but only for the advantages of education, are not worthy the names they bear, having neither principle nor character. The real facts out of which the recent disturbances upon which those poor kings were arrested and transported arose are the following. Some time ago a case came on before his Honour Chief Justice Marshall, being a charge by one Djuabin man, named Owoosoo Brempong, against the late Affraocma, the daughter of Assafo Adjaye, known as the Djuabin Queen, of extortion of money, say 37£. odd. The cause of the charge was this: during the time the late Queen was imprisoned at Elmina, this Owoosoo Brempong's wife, by name Accosiea, who was living with her at Elmina, was seduced by a man called Quamin Frempong, whom the Queen called her husband. On the Queen hearing this, she sent to the husband of that woman for satisfaction, alleging that his wife had no right to be known by her husband. This money was paid, nolens volens, by Owoosoo Brempong; but on the return of both Assafo Adjaye and the Queen to Accra, the man appealed against the Queen and claimed the money back. Assafo Adjaye investigated the matter, and pronouncing the Queen wrong, he ordered her to refund the amount and drive the ragamuffin Frempong from her residence. The Queen disobeyed the order. The appellant sued her in the Supreme Court, and obtained judgment; but she would not obey the order of the Court, and plotted with Mr. — to deprive her father of the Royal stool, she claiming to be the lawful owner. Why our poor lamented Mr. Ussher so much interested himself in such a scandalous matter as to have brought it to this crisis, God knows; but to us it appears in every wise similar to the case of King Herod and the daughter of Herodias. Governor Ussher promised her “whatsoever she would ask of him”; and her own father Assafo Adjaye's head was what she demanded. She made a complaint to Governor Ussher that her father was conspiring with the Djuabins against her, and therefore she must have the stool from him. Adjaye maintained that he held the stool from his father and the country for life. Governor Ussher sent for the people from the bush, a place called Konfroduah and Acuapin, for the purpose. The people confirmed the statement of Adjaye. Governor Ussher got puzzled; told Adjaye and the daughter to go and have the matter settled before their own people. When they came from the Castle, the Queen refused to listen to anything but the stool being given up to her. Adjaye, however, thinking that the case could not be settled except they had disinterested people among them to determine the case, asked King Tackie to settle it for them. King Tackie gave notice to the Queen to attend on Wednesday, the 14th of October last. When the King and all the people met, she was sent for, having been notified the previous evening; but she asked for advice from the before-mentioned Mr. —, whose practice and aims in respect of the Djuabins' well-being in the protectorate I have already mentioned. He advised her not to attend, and wrote to her that he was going to give information to the Governor.

The first of these is the fact that some of these boundaries cut across pre-existing ethnic groups, states and kingdoms and this has caused widespread social disruption and displace› ment.

Throughout the nineteenth century, Americo-Liberians' policy was to assimilate the indigenous Africans culturally and politically by 'civilizing' and Christianizing them, and giving them equal rights with the settlers. Although this was achieved to some extent with the Recaptives (who were much less numerous than the settlers), the Americo-Liberians, mindful of their own privileged position, main› tained tight political control over Liberia by restricting political participa› tion of even those indigenous Africans who were educated. Only very few of them were given the franchise on an equal footing with the AmericoLiberians (although these might themselves be illiterate and poor). The main indigenous African representation (mostly of the coastal Africans) in the Liberian Legislature as from 1875 consisted of African chiefs designated 'referees' (or 'delegates'), after their chiefdoms had paid an annual 'delegate fee' of $100 to the Liberian government.

Furthermore the Liberian government sought to maximize its import and export duties and other levies on trade and shipping which constituted its main sources of revenue. To facilitate collection and control of the external trade by Americo-Liberian merchants, from 1839 the government restricted foreign merchants to trade at only six Americo-Liberian portsof-entry. The restrictions and levies alienated both the foreign merchants who resented them, and the indigenous African chiefs who had formerly controlled the external trade and levied the dues. Often, the foreign merchants and chiefs combined to resist or defy the trade restrictions and levies, or to appeal to European states to intervene on their behalf. Thus, at various times during the nineteenth century, the Vai, Kru and Grebo of the Liberian coast put up an armed resistance to Liberian government impositions on their trade. 9"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Foreign intervention in Liberia and Ethiopia, 1915-35 > Liberia', 'content': ""Predictably, the United States and British governments reacted to these reports by demanding that the Liberian government should put an end to the so-called military reprisals against the Kru 'pending the conclusion of an arrangement between the League, the United States and Liberia for the future administration of the country'.$^{96}$ The Liberian government on its own part promptly protested to the League against this fresh threat by America and Britain against Liberia's sovereignty.$^{97}$ In addition, President Barclay sent a fact-finding commission of three men led by Winthrop A. Travell, an American employed in Liberia's fiscal service, to ascertain the situation on the Kru coast.\nThe commission's subsequent findings largely refuted the charges of wanton destruction made against the Frontier Force detachment.$^{98}$ And, fortunately for Liberia, the League reacted not by imposing a foreign administration over Liberia as America and Britain had mooted, but by sending a representative, Dr Melville D.

The European powers had partitioned the continent into some forty political units. The new boun¬ daries have been regarded by some scholars as unacceptable because they were deemed to be arbitrary, artificial, precipitate and haphazard and to have distorted the national pre-European political order. Others, such as Joseph Anene and Saadia Touval, have regarded them as making more sense than they did by 1879.63\nThere is some truth in both points of view. Some 30% of the total length of the borders were drawn as straight lines, and these and others often cut right across ethnic and linguistic boundaries. On the other hand, the remaining borders did follow national boundaries and cannot therefore be considered as arbitrary or as ill-considered as the criticisms would suggest. Moreover, African political units evolving as a result, for example, of the Oyo-Dahomey conflict, the Fulani djihâds, the Mfecane in Southern Africa, or the internal struggle for power in both Ethiopia and Uganda during the second half of the nineteenth century, testify to the fluidity of African boundaries, frontiers and enclaves prior to the partition. What is not often realized is the extent to which the partition solidified these fluid boundaries, or the extent of the efforts made by the boundary com› missioners to rectify anomalies, where politically possible, during the numerous boundary delimitations. On balance, then, although the map of Africa in 1914 (see Fig. 2.1), compared to what it was in 1879, may have looked very confusing, the delimitation had nevertheless been a remarkably efficient job, thanks to the new advances in cartography. And although the partition must be condemned as illegal and immoral, and it must be recognized that some of the boundaries were indeed artificial and arbitrary, it would be undesirable - indeed dangerous - to continue to advocate a return to the fluid, pre-European international boundaries except after a very close scrutiny - because of the 'mess' said to have been created by the partition."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': ""Economic and social developments and European intervention in Liberia's and Ethiopia's internal affairs, 1880-1914 > Liberia"", 'content': ""Side by side with European encroachments, Liberia faced serious internal economic and social problems. The Scramble and partition forced the Liberian government to advance into the Liberian hinterland to subjugate the indigenous ethnic groups and establish a colonial-type administration over them.$^{64}$ Each administrative unit or district was governed 'in› directly' through its principal chiefs in collaboration with a governmentappointed district commissioner. Up to 1914 most of the commissioners were Americo-Liberian or educated indigenous Liberian military officers. The administration was largely oppressive and corrupt. Most of the district commissioners, their aides, and troops, being poorly and irregularly paid, and seldom supervised from Monrovia, lived off their districts by extorting food, labour for their private farms, and excessive fines and taxes (above the official one dollar poll-tax on adult males, and labour required for public buildings and roads). 65 Not surprisingly, the indigenous Africans resisted not only their military subjugation to Liberian government authority - just as Africans elsewhere resisted subjugation to European rule - but also the excesses of the Liberian administration. Until subjugated by the Liberian militia, the Liberian Frontier Force and American naval ships, the Kru resisted intermittently, and particularly in 1915-16; the Grebo resisted in 1910; the Kissi in 1913; the Kpele and Bandi, 1911-14; the Gio and Mano, 1913-18; the Gbolobo Grebo, 1916-18; the Gola and Bandi, 1918-19; the Joquelle Kpele, 1916-20; and the Sikon in 1921. These protracted wars on different fronts and the cost and inefficiency of the 'native administration' encouraged foreign intervention and strained the government's human and material resources. 66 The government's revenues were never adequate. Foreign aid was meagre. Most Americo-Liberians preferred trade to agriculture and were seriously hurt by the worldwide depression of the late nineteenth century. By 1890 resident German, British and Dutch merchants dominated Liberia's external trade. Coffee, Liberia's major export commodity since the 1860s, was produced mostly by Americo-Liberian planters and entrepreneurs using both Recaptive and indigenous African labour.

There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years.

The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged.

The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 146, 'article_title': 'SIERRA LEONE', 'full_section_title': 'SIERRA LEONE', 'last_edit_date': '04-17-1863', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-1', 'issue_date': '23_05_1863', 'content': ""Major Jones, of the 2nd West India Regiment, having been appointed by the Governor to be one of the Commissioners for settling boundaries with the Liberian Government, left for Monrovia in Her Majesty's ship Philomel, on the 10th April.\n\nThirteen wounded soldiers have arrived from Lagos, having been hurt in the attacks on Epé.\n\nIt is stated here that the Gold Coast Artillery Corps is to be disbanded, in consequence of the mutiny, for which two of the soldiers were shot, and above eighty are now in penal servitude.

To their hands the President and the Senate of the Republic of Liberia have entrusted the settlement of that important question which has been pending between our Government and theirs for so many years, viz., the decision of the limits of the territory over which the respective Governments should be considered as entitled to exercise Governmental control. This question, existing as far back as 1860, has occupied the attention of many of my predecessors, and has given rise to commissions which have met from time to time, with a view to arriving at a satisfactory adjustment of the vexed question, as to which of the Governments should rule over the seaboard between Sherbro and Cape Mount. My distinguished predecessor, Sir Arthur Havelock, was, unfortunately, unable to bring these negotiations to a settled conclusion. On his visit to Monrovia in 1882, he submitted to the President of that Republic a Convention which recorded in exact terms the precise limit along the sea-coast over which each might exercise legitimate sovereignty, and it has been my good fortune to complete these negotiations. The happy duty has now devolved upon me of signing, on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, that Convention, which having been signed also by the accredited Commissioners of the Government of Liberia, will, I trust, set at rest those differences which from time to time have impeded the progress of civilization, and lessened perhaps the harmony which it is always desirable should exist between States whose territorial limits are conterminous and whose interests are identical. I ask you, gentlemen, to join in a toast which I feel assured you will all receive in the manner which it deserves. It is ""Success to the Republic of Liberia;"" and I couple with that toast the name of the President of that Republic, and the names of the two gentlemen whom I have the honour to specially entertain as my guests this evening. Sister States, side by side on this Eastern shore of the broad Atlantic, peopled by members of the African race who have adopted the habits of Western civilization, cannot be other than united by the ties of one common duty, and that duty is the furtherance of civilization in this African land, amongst those native tribes, their immediate neighbours, who have not enjoyed the opportunities afforded to the inhabitants of Sierra Leone and to the emigrants from the United States to Liberia, of becoming acquainted with that higher and purer thought which we of the Northern clime maintain, pervades the people of Europe and America. It has been my good fortune during my tenure of office in this place to do something to bring this civilization nearer to some of the tribes on our immediate border. Such an end seems to me not unworthy of any personal effort or sacrifice which it has been in my power to make, and which I have thought likely to secure it. This Government, gentlemen, can never look with jealousy on any effort made by the Republic of Liberia to induce the aboriginal inhabitants contiguous to its seaboard to enter into closer relations with themselves than have hitherto prevailed; and I trust that the Convention which was signed yesterday, marking as it does to some extent our respective limits, may have the effect of assisting both Governments to divert those energies which may hitherto have been uselessly expended on the adjustment of past differences, into a channel more worthy of their efforts. I mean the possible extension of the influence of governments on the seaboard over inland tribes dwelling nearer or farther from their borders. An incident which calls for more than passing notice has of late excited our attention. I refer to the movement of the interior tribes towards the seaboard which is specially represented by the advance of the power of Samudu. A fixed determination seems to have possessed certain interior tribes inhabiting a tract of country some 400 or 500 miles long, by perhaps 200 or 300 broad, to overcome the obstacles which so far as we have learnt have always prevented their free access to the trading stations on the seaboard; and that determination has been carried into action by the forces of Almami Samudu, who have advanced to within a few miles of this place. It cannot be doubted that it would be of very great advantage to the trade of this port if such an uninterrupted communication existed; nor can it be imagined that the neighbouring Government of Liberia, though not so entirely dependent upon trade for its successful development as this settlement appears to be, should not desire equally with ourselves to encourage those communications which in past years have existed between the seaboard under its Government and the Mahomedan tribes of the interior. For by the free communication between those tribes and the people on the sea-coast, produce will find its way to Liberian ports which by shipment and exchange will add largely to the commercial improvement of that country. Efforts have, I believe, already been made by the Republic for the development of such routes and for the acquirement of the geographical knowledge which would tend to encourage such communications.

These would come with a development of her resources. But she has no content. She is devoured by unsatisfied longings. She has an idea of a sort of Monroe doctrine for Africa. Her citizens have brought there exorbitant pretensions with them from the United States.

Considering the proximity of Sierra Leone, and certain treaties and relations of Great Britain with some of the native authorities within the coveted region, this fiat was no slight thing to ask. But, notwithstanding the proverbial modesty of republics, Liberia made up her mind to press for it. She affirmed that she had purchased the sovereignty. At her urgent intreaty, commissioners were finally appointed by the British Government, to agree with her commissioners on a north-western boundary. But when the British commissioners came to investigate the Liberian claims, their shadowy nature was at once apparent.

The signatories for France are MM. Hanotaux and Haussmann, and for Liberia the Baron de Stein, Minister Resident and Consul-General of that Republic in Belgium. The importance of this treaty is considerable. From the English point of view the chief matter is that the hinterland line of the upper part of Liberia's western boundary separates a portion of the English Sierra Leone from the French possessions in the Soudan. France thus secures a buffer State with a large stretch of territory between the Samory country and Sierra Leone. This result is secured by France having extended and defined the hinterland of Liberia. In exchange Liberia has renounced all rights east of Cavally river, thus virtually rendering that river French. This is the chief success of M. Hanotaux, and in order to obtain it he has given up all the Garraway territory west of Cavally and the various points formerly ceded to France on the Liberian coast. The treaty is as follows:—\n\nThe undersigned ... deputed by the Governments of Liberia and of the French Republic to frame an agreement relating to the delimitation of the territories of the Republic of Liberia and the French possession, have agreed to the following arrangement under reserve on either side of ratification by the respective Governments:—\n\n**Art. I.**—On the Ivory Coast and in the interior the frontier line between the French possession and the Republic of Liberia shall be constituted as follows, in conformity to the tracing in red ink on the map annexed to the present agreement and marked, viz: (1) The Thalweg of the Cavally river up to a point situated about twenty miles to the south of the junction of the river Fodedougou Ba at the intersection of 6° 30' north latitude and of 9° 12' longitude west, Paris. (2) By the parallel passing through the said point of intersection up to its junction with the 10th degree of west longitude (Paris), it being understood that the basin of the Grand Seeters belongs to Liberia, and that the basin of the Fodedougou Ba belongs to France. (3) By the 10th degree up to its juncture with the 7th parallel north latitude. From this point the frontier shall go in a straight line towards the point of intersection of the 11th degree with the parallel which passes through Tombicounda, it being understood that the town of Bamaquillad and the town of Mahomadou belong to the Republic of Liberia, and that the points of Naala and Musardou belong in return to France. (4) The frontier shall then take a westward direction, following the same parallel up to the juncture of the 13th degree of west longitude with the Anglo-French frontier of Sierra Leone. This line must in every case insure to France the entire basin of the Niger and its tributaries."", 'last_edit_date': '1894-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1894#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Proposed Settlement of the Liberian North-west Boundary Question', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following is a leading article in the Liberian paper, the _Observer_, on the North-west Boundary Question: ""We hope all the wiseacres are satisfied about the benevolent intentions of the English Government. We have been long ago convinced that the English Government would never have gone to all the trouble it has unless it had designs looking to territorial aggrandizement southward of Sherbro\'. That Government now gives plain utterance to that at which its agents have been hinting a long time ago. The Liberian Government has not been wise in its generation. It has attempted to trade upon the supposed philanthropy of its rival, and it is likely to suffer in consequence. If Liberia does lose her northern territories, it is to be hoped that her statesmen will take to heart the lesson that from the day she declared her independence she was expected to have learned: that the era of philanthropy for her was over. She was to fight her own battles, look out for her own interests, stand up for her own rights. Failing to do this, she would suffer the consequences. Now in all the controversy about our North-west boundary we have blindly followed the path traced out by the English Government. We have done nothing that it was thought would offend. Their traders went into Mannah country. We enforced the laws they had ignored, were threatened with chastisement, paid an indemnity, saying we should protest, which we never formally did, and now we are told that we never protested—therefore it is an admission against us. Previous to the time of the Sulymah meeting, the English sent agents into the territory to collect evidence adverse to us, and paid for such evidence. We, although we had strong backers in the disputed territories, never made an effort to look after our interests and strengthen our case. Nor did we raise a single objection to the proceedings of the English Colonial Government. It might displease them; they would do right. Well, they have done right. They have cooked up a spurious claim made by a lot of exceedingly doubtful character, purporting to have been sworn in before magistrates influenced by traders known to be anxious for the acquisition of the country by Great Britain; and now they say, ""This is good claim; we must believe our citizens and our magistrates in preference to yours; give up the territory for the claim."" That the Cabinet was actually ready to fall in with the views of the English is heart-rending. Without animadversion, it certainly can be said with truth that they have disappointed the country. The protest transmitted by the citizens of Monrovia to the President truthfully points out the reason why we cannot accede without at least a struggle to the demands of the English Government. It would be but the beginning of the end. The territorial acquisitions which Great Britain contemplates making at our expense would practically place the northern boundary of Liberia at the St. Paul\'s River.

We have no objection to this application of the principle of a buffer State, provided the Liberians are equal to the responsibilities involved. Otherwise we shall be worse off with the Liberians as neighbours than the French. Nor are the advantages of the interposition of a buffer State between the territories of two great Powers very conspicuous where the buffer State does not entirely separate their frontiers, but merely subtracts from the line of contact. A glance at the map will show that by far the greater part of the Sierra Leone frontier will remain conterminous with French territory. The question for us is not the delimitation of the Franco-Liberian, but the delimitation of the Anglo-French frontier; and this work is still dragging its slow length along. Early this year the two countries were reminded unpleasantly of the frontier question by the collision between English and French troops at Weeima. We assume that the French Government has not given to Liberia any territory which belongs to us, as any treaty between France and Liberia can only have effect subject to our own claims. As for the Liberians themselves, the French seem to have been fairly liberal to them, not cutting off much, if any, of the Hinterland usually given to Liberia on modern maps. France takes the coast east of the Cavally, and there is a mutual surrender of claims west and east respectively of the mouth of that river.\n\nUpon the whole the treaty may be regarded by us with approbation, as terminating a state of things which might give rise to international complications. Our countrymen will note it as one more step taken by France to realise her dream of an African empire extending from Algeria to the Congo. The pith of the treaty is no doubt to be found in the reservation to France of the entire basin of the Niger and its tributaries. This may be read in connexion with the clause conceding to her the free navigation of the Cavally. French explorers hope to discover a connexion between the upper course of that river and one of the navigable affluents of the Niger, thus giving themselves an outlet to the sea. This idea shows that Frenchmen are alive to the possibilities arising out of their new conquests. Nor can we be indifferent to the consequences of the isolation of Sierra Leone, now completed by the formal absorption of Samory's dominions.

In 1870 negotiations were first opened upon the basis of an exchange of territories. The Franco-German War put an end to them for the time, but they were renewed in 1876, when the proposal that Great Britain should cede the Gambia to France, and that France should in return renounce all claims and influence over the West African Coast from the Rio Pongas to the Gaboon, was rendered abortive by the opposition of the British trading interests concerned. Petitions from the English community of the Gambia against the transfer were so strongly supported in this country that Lord Carnarvon abandoned the scheme, and the field was left open to French and German enterprise. Three years later the seizure of the island of Matacong aroused fresh interest in the subject, and negotiations, which led to the arrangement of 1882, were entered into. By this agreement it was hoped to fix the boundaries between French and English territory to the north of Sierra Leone. A convention was concluded, but the French Chamber refused to ratify it, and though it remained as a basis of agreement between the Governments it was never formally accepted.

A section of the German Press is taking an anti-English line in respect to the negotiations as to the Hinterland of the Gold Coast Colony and Togoland. This time, however, no ground exists for any cause of alarm on the part of German patriots, and an appeal to Berlin has elicited the statement that what is being done in those regions is with the consent and with the knowledge of both Governments. It is not only of England's advance in Western Africa that German colonists are jealous; a similar state of feeling is entertained, if not openly expressed, towards France. For many reasons this sentiment of suspicion is to be deplored. It handicaps the progress of civilisation, and causes outbursts of ill-temper that do not harmonise with the friendly relations existing between the different European Powers interested in that part of the globe. The matters in dispute are soon rectified, but a feeling of irritation is set up which is not so quickly forgotten. On the Gulf of Guinea, excluding the Republic of Liberia, are situated the French possessions of Assinie and Dahomey, the Gold Coast Colony, the Colony of Lagos, and the Niger Protectorate belonging to Great Britain, and Togoland under the protection of Germany. Originally the frontiers of these territories were open at the rear, and their boundaries were ill-defined, owing to incorrect surveys, disputed titles, and conflicting tribal claims. But of late a change has taken place in this respect. Various treaties have been entered into between England and France, so that the French frontier difficulties have been considerably modified, and a line of future action agreed upon. In 1890, a further step was taken as regards internal delimitation. The French Government, noting that the progress of the two countries must, if unchecked, lead to conflicting claims, suggested that a point should be selected beyond which neither Power should pass. This suggestion was effected by a declaration providing a basis for negotiations for the demarcation of spheres in the regions which extend to the west and to the south of the Middle and Upper Niger. As regards German frontier questions, the Agreement which ceded Heligoland to Germany defines the boundary line between Togoland and the Gold Coast Colony. North of that boundary lies what is known as the neutral zone, within which both parties to the Agreement have bound themselves not to acquire Protectorate.

It is about 102 years old, thus considerably younger than the Gambia, which almost ranks with Newfoundland as being one of the very first British possessions abroad. Sierra Leone, however, has not much to show for its century of British rule. Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary. Here at present the great Mahommedan Chief Samadu is the actual ruler, and has created one of those African empires which are easily reared by successful robbers with extravagant bloodshed and widespread depredation. Samadu has several times fought the French on the Senegambian frontier, but of late he is said to have concluded peace with them. The productions of Sierra Leone are those of true Western Africa, and the colony is rich and well-favoured in vegetable wealth. It exports palm oil, palm kernels, rubber, gum, camwood, besides skins and benniseed and ground nuts.\n\nLiberia is British in language, and to a great extent in such culture as it possesses, although it enjoys an independent Government.

The question under discussion is one of those curious points which sometimes arise in treaties relating to countries of which maps can give only an approximately correct idea. For the past twenty-five years France has been gradually closing in upon Sierra Leone, whose sole trade is in the various products which reach the coast from the interior. This trade is now a valuable one, the exports amounting to something like £400,000 a year, and the imports, mostly from England, to a similar sum. In August 1889, a convention was come to between the two countries as to the spheres of influence in the ""Hinterland,"" and it was agreed that the boundaries of Sierra Leone should not extend beyond 11:40 of longitude West of Greenwich and 10 degrees of latitude. Near the borderline was the important native town of Fararma, situated almost at the source of the River Niger. It is here that the native caravans on their way to Sierra Leone from the interior have to cross the river, and it is consequently a place of great commercial importance. On the French maps Fararma is shown well within the French boundary; but accurate observation demonstrates that it is really within the British limits, and the inhabitants of Sierra Leone are anxious to retain this important entrepôt of trade in their own hands.

The treaty laid before Parliament contains a copy of the German Admiralty chart referred to. The second agreement is with Portugal, and relates to the spheres of influence north of the Zambesi. It takes the form of an interchange of notes between Lord Rosebery and the Portuguese Minister in London, recording the understanding come to between the two Governments for a modus vivendi pending delimitation.

This indebtedness enabled the imperial powers to constantly interfere in the internal affairs of Liberia during the period under review in a way that they never did in Ethiopia where they were never provided with the cause nor the excuse so to do.

The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo. The most significant action of the period was the British occupation of Egypt in 1882. For the British the action was justified because of the strategic position of Egypt (with the Suez Canal and the Nile) for British interests in India and East Africa, although East Africa was considered of less importance. But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year. In West Africa Germany and France were beginning to stand together to challenge the British position on the Niger. The 'high tide of imperialism' had begun to flow. When Bismark convened the Berlin Conference in November 1884, the process of partitioning Africa had already started. In East Africa Carl Peters had already arrived in Zanzibar under the auspices of his Gesellschaft für Deutsche Kolonisation (German Colonization Society) and had gone inland to negotiate treaties.

The British and French foreign ministers, Hoare and Laval, therefore met in Paris on 7 December to devise a new compromise. It had two main principles: first, an 'exchange of territories' whereby Ethiopia would cede to Italy the Ogaden and a large part of Tigre in exchange for a port on either the Red Sea or the Gulf of Aden; second, Italy would be given a 'zone of economic expansion and colonization' in the greater part of Ethiopia south of Addis Ababa; this area was to remain part of Ethiopia, but Italy was to have exclusive economic rights therein. News of this plan, which was a criminal surrender to the condemned aggressor and a total abandonment of the League, leaked to the French press, and created a storm of indignation in many countries, particularly in Britain where Hoare was obliged to resign on 18 December. 118 Ethiopia at the close of 1935 was thus in the forefront of world news and the centre of international excitement and indignation.

Though the Ethiopian army was soon to be defeated, much fierce fighting lay ahead before the Italians occupied Addis Ababa on 6 May 1936. This was followed by five long years of Italian Fascist usurpation, during four of which the Ethiopian patriots were to fight on alone. 121 The Duce's invasion evoked instant reaction in and around Africa. 122 In August 1935, a group of Africans and persons of African descent in London founded the International African Friends of Abyssinia, whose committee included C.

The ""Home for the Blind"" is a simple, unpretending stone edifice, and has already two inmates. Every facility exists for extension should funds be forthcoming. Patients are, unhappily, not likely to be wanting. It is said that at the Gambia—our British Gambia—there are not less than *one hundred destitute blind* for whom nothing has even been attempted.

The *Liberian Herald* forgets that if the right of Liberia to those coast districts had been established and acknowledged, it must have immediately endeavoured to rule them, which we again assert, without fear of contradiction, would have been ruinous for the Republic—while it need not, and will not, attempt its forward march interiorward until it has acquired that population and wealth which will at the same time necessitate the expansion of its frontiers and enable it to achieve what it requires with unmixed benefit both to itself and to the native territories brought under its civilising sway. We are convinced that our views are more consonant with real Liberian and other African advancement and civilisation than are those of the Liberians who crave an extended coast line. Once for all, we must say that it is ridiculous for Liberia, with such a coast line as she already possesses, to talk of being ""cramped.""

It appears that when the African Times reached those places, the Cavalla and Rocktown people comprehended at once the danger in which they stood of the visit of a British ship of war, and sent back the wretched captives to their homes. It is well they did so, because the British Government would not have hesitated to lend the services of a ship of war to the Government of Liberia for obtaining the release of the captives. Should the peace written of as likely to be restored between the people of those towns be also established as a further fruit of our labours, such a result will give us an added pleasure. We know that when the present estimable President of the Republic became convinced that the report given by us of the atrocious treatment of those poor women was substantially correct, he became very anxious to obtain their liberation, in which, however, he had great difficulties to contend with, in consequence of the unjustifiable and disgraceful opposition of the Cape Palmas Americans to his Government.

The Boom chiefs only require a little encouragement and sympathy in order to take active steps to secure Cannagboh and hand him over to Governor Rowe, and the Kittam chiefs merely require a hint that their action towards peaceable traders is not unnoticed by his Excellency, who will interfere effectually if matters are carried too far. It is much to be desired that Governor Rowe would become his former self again, suspend for a time his financial labours, and apply his great energies, so long misdirected, to the tranquilization of the country and the development of its resources. At present his attitude in supinely looking on and reckoning up the revenue, whilst the country is daily becoming more and more given up to the machinations of hostile chiefs and of marauders like Cannagboh, is about as wise as would be the conduct of a miser who sat counting his money whilst robbers were preparing to break into his house.\n\n**SHERBRO'.**\n\nP.S.—I learn that the report of the hoisting of the Liberian flag at Gumbo, mentioned in my last, is premature, but strenuous efforts have been made to induce the chiefs interested to consent to such a course.

A person fully acquainted with Sherbro' and the Kittam ought to be nominated to act with or advise the Commissioners referred to; and some of the 700l. per annum for stipends to the chiefs, long since approved of by the Secretary of State, but never fully appropriated, should be given to W.

Mr. Woodin says, in the absence of particulars, he cannot explain or understand the action of the Liberians. He has been trading at Cavally for the past four years, and much of this time the Beatrice has been there.

As regards any question of Customs duty, Mr. Woodin says he has never been asked to pay any, as the place is perfectly free. Cavally has always been ruled by the natives of the place, and although Liberia has asserted claims to it she has never put her pretentions into practice. The only ports of entry for goods into the country of Liberia are as follows, and these are given to shippers by the Liberian Consul at Liverpool: Roberts Port, Monrovia, Marshall, Grand Bassa, Greenville, and Cape Palmas.

That Government now gives plain utterance to that at which its agents have been hinting a long time ago. The Liberian Government has not been wise in its generation. It has attempted to trade upon the supposed philanthropy of its rival, and it is likely to suffer in consequence. If Liberia does lose her northern territories, it is to be hoped that her statesmen will take to heart the lesson that from the day she declared her independence she was expected to have learned: that the era of philanthropy for her was over. She was to fight her own battles, look out for her own interests, stand up for her own rights. Failing to do this, she would suffer the consequences. Now in all the controversy about our North-west boundary we have blindly followed the path traced out by the English Government. We have done nothing that it was thought would offend. Their traders went into Mannah country. We enforced the laws they had ignored, were threatened with chastisement, paid an indemnity, saying we should protest, which we never formally did, and now we are told that we never protested—therefore it is an admission against us. Previous to the time of the Sulymah meeting, the English sent agents into the territory to collect evidence adverse to us, and paid for such evidence. We, although we had strong backers in the disputed territories, never made an effort to look after our interests and strengthen our case. Nor did we raise a single objection to the proceedings of the English Colonial Government. It might displease them; they would do right. Well, they have done right. They have cooked up a spurious claim made by a lot of exceedingly doubtful character, purporting to have been sworn in before magistrates influenced by traders known to be anxious for the acquisition of the country by Great Britain; and now they say, ""This is good claim; we must believe our citizens and our magistrates in preference to yours; give up the territory for the claim."" That the Cabinet was actually ready to fall in with the views of the English is heart-rending. Without animadversion, it certainly can be said with truth that they have disappointed the country. The protest transmitted by the citizens of Monrovia to the President truthfully points out the reason why we cannot accede without at least a struggle to the demands of the English Government. It would be but the beginning of the end. The territorial acquisitions which Great Britain contemplates making at our expense would practically place the northern boundary of Liberia at the St. Paul\'s River.

It was understood that the British vessels would go first to Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, where Governor Cardew would interview President Cheeseman, and then proceed to Grand Bassa. Reports credited at Sierra Leone stated that a club of Liberians had been formed at Grand Bassa, the object of which was to annoy and harass the Sierra Leone subjects in Liberia, with the view of driving them out of the country. The houses of two Sierra Leone merchants, Mr. Nylander and Mr. Reffell, were set on fire. That of the former gentleman was entirely destroyed, the Liberians surrounding the burning building and threatening to shoot any Sierra Leoneans who attempted to extinguish the flames or to save any of the contents. A notice was also posted up in the streets ordering all Sierra Leone Natives to quit that part of the Republic within thirty days, otherwise they would be killed by the members of the club.

For months past it has been pointed out that the French and other European nations were gradually bearing in upon the irregularly defined boundaries of our authority towards the interior; and now the constriction of the annexation band which the recent settlements of the French have completed around the eastern and northern limits of the British sphere in West Africa is beginning to be most painfully felt upon our trade and intercourse with the interior. From Sierra Leone we have complaints that by the appropriation of the hinterlands British authority is confined to a narrow strip of coast; that French authority compels tribes outside our control to boycott our markets and to favour those of France. One effect is that natives are moving inside the British lines. The aggression assumes a most active form on the borders of our old colony on the Gambia. The Governor has investigated the circumstances attending the hauling-down of the Union Jack at two stations in the interior. In one case it was found that the district was distinctly under British protection; the other was about ""forty yards outside the British limit."" Doubtless, this is a near thing; but the rule the French, with the rest of our rivals, are in the habit of applying is, that ground which cannot be proved to belong to us must belong to them. Since the downfall of the Spanish Colonial Empire in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Great Britain has been...\n\ntill lately, the only European Power of the first rank which has devoted its energies to the construction of an Empire outside the geographical limits of its own home. In the absence of rivals, the course has been comparatively clear; and it seems difficult for Governments to realise that all this has been changed during the last two decades. If we would maintain the Empire which has been handed down to us by the enterprise and enthusiasm of the last nine generations, it can only be done by a ready recognition of the fact that other nations around us are only too eager to circumvent our plans, and to take advantage of every slip and inaction on our part.', 'last_edit_date': '1893-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1893#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SIERRA LEONE, LIBERIA, AND BRITISH POLICY ON THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There is now also another argument, if one had been wanting.

We must not pursue a dog in the manger policy. Those States, while they remain what is termed independent, are incapable—utterly incapable—of making any advance in civilization. They are not only thus incapable, but are a source of continual trouble and annoyance to us. They must not be allowed to remain subject only to all their own native abominations, and unattached to any civilised State. They must become either Liberian or English.

Rather more than two years ago, an agreement was concluded at Paris between our Government and that of France with regard to the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence in West Africa. The territories referred to in the agreement were Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast.

The work of determining the boundary line between Senegambia and Sierra Leone is now about to be begun, the British Commissioners having left Liverpool on Saturday last.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'Conquest and reaction in British West Africa, 1880-1900 > Southern Nigeria', 'content': ""While the Yoruba, by and large, chose the strategy of submission, the rulers of the kingdom of Benin and some of the rulers of the states of the Niger Delta chose that of confrontation.

Moreover, all of them were insisting on their sovereign rights to regulate trade and to levy duties on British traders. This, the new British consuls, such as Hewett and Johnston, would not tolerate. A typical example of the rulers who stood up to the British consuls and missionaries was Jaja of Opobo (see Plate 6.3). He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order. When Jaja still refused to comply in spite of Johnston's threats to bombard his town with British gunboats, Johnston enticed Jaja on board a ship in 1887 under a promise of safeconduct but arrested him and sent him to Accra$^{49}$ where he was tried and deported to the West Indies.

In 1850 and 1863 war was narrowly averted but between 1869 and 1872, the Asante launched a three-pronged attack which resulted in the occupation of virtually all the southern and coastal states of the Gold Coast. To beat back the Asante, the British government launched one of the best organized campaigns of the period under the command of one of the most famous British officers of the day, General Garnet Wolseley. Armed with the latest weapons, this army succeeded in pushing the Asante army across the Pra river and entered and sacked Kumasi in February 1874 after a very fierce last-ditch stand by the Asante army at Amoafo near Bekwai. 40 This decisive defeat of the Asante by the British in 1874 had very far-reaching consequences and was to influence, to a great extent, the reactions of the Asante during the period 1880-1900. The first obvious effect was the disintegration of the Asante empire. By the Treaty of Fomena, Asante recognized the independence of all the vassal states south of the Pra. Taking advantage of the weakening of the military power of Asante, the vassal states to the north of the Volta river also broke away. Even the core of the empire that remained began to break up. Anxious to see that the Asante empire was never revived, the British instigated some of the member states of the Asante Union to assert their independence, and Dwaben, Kokofu, Bekwai and Nsuta began to defy the Asantehene.$^{4}$ ' The conflict between Kumasi and Dwaben in fact led to a civil war which ended in the defeat of the former and the mass migration of the people into the recently proclaimed British Protectorate and Colony of the Gold Coast.

At one time, he would play the two Christian sects, Catholics and Protestants, against Muslims when he thought the latter were becoming too powerful and therefore threatening his control of the country. At another time, he would ally with Muslims against Catholics or Protestants or both depending on who he thought was dangerous to his rule. Thus, Mwanga was adept at the diplomatic game of divide and rule, a tactic which the colonizing powers were able to use so effectively in controlling Africa. When it was necessary, Mwanga resorted to a revival of some old tradition in an attempt to drive out all foreigners as happened in 1888.$^{30}$ On this occasion, he intended to entice all foreigners and their Baganda followers to a naval parade on an island on Lake Victoria. There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The legacy of wars', 'content': 'In other words, while European powers were dealing with individual African states, recognizing them, befriending some and fighting others in Africa, in Europe they closed ranks along racial lines and formed a cartel to regulate the flow of essential arms to the Africans.

The competition for power in Africa had been drawn into the international politics of the Concert of Europe where African diplomatic skills were at a grave disadvantage. It is doubtful whether African leaders realized until too late how great was the danger that threatened them. They were used to thinking that the European base was far away and that, in the final analysis, they had the advantage of numbers.\nThey continued to act as if they could play off one European power against another. In South Africa, they even believed that they could appeal to the Queen of England and her direct representatives to carry out treaty obligations against the wishes of Anglo-Boer settlers and fortune seekers. Far from any notion of forging a pan-African solidarity similar to that pursued by the Europeans, each African state acted as seemed best in its own individual interest.\nIt appears that, if any factor is to be singled out, the basic explanation for this was to be found not only in the diplomatic abilities of the European strategists, but also in the legacy of wars that was part of the revolutionary situation of nineteenth-century Africa.

Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel.

They were subsequently taken on board the Rattlesnake, about six months ago, on a cruise to different parts of the Coast, and were landed the other day at Cape Coast Castle.

The road to the River Prah should be made a good military road; those precautions on the River Volta and in the Eastern Districts generally—for which we have constantly pleaded from the time war was imminent—for preventing the passage of guns, powder, lead, and salt (as also from Elmina), &c., to Ashantee, should be taken and made effective. Then communications should be opened with Coomassie—the fixed resolution of the British Government, unless terms of agreement are come to, should be made known—and every proper effort be employed for re-establishing peaceful relations. It was British power that first checked the conquests of the Ashantees. The mere organization of the native forces by Englishmen led to that series of discomfitures which lost them the sovereignty of the *Territories* and led to its transfer to us under the name of the *Protectorate*. But for us, the Ashantees would have massacred or sold off to slave-ships the whole of the population. They would do this even now but for our presence and protection. They therefore respect, while they hate, the British name; and we firmly believe that, if they were once persuaded of our being fully in earnest, some terms of adjustment might be agreed upon. But this they will never believe while we allow them to receive supplies and sell slaves by way of the Volta.

The day before yesterday, Mr. Bonner and Mr. and Mrs. Ramsager arrived at Monsy Camp, where every courtesy was shown to them. The officers of Wood\'s regiment turned out of their leafy hut for Mrs. Ramsager and the children, and the Staff took care that every attention was paid to their comfort. Their long detention does not appear to have affected their health, and two more healthy-looking children it would be difficult to find anywhere. Mr. Ramsager and his family proceed to the coast, while Mr. Bonner will spend some days with Sir Garnet Wolseley, who yesterday moved his head-quarters to Foomsah, a clean, well-built town for this country, where usually the chief officer of the Addowtie district has his residence. It seems that the great \'fetishes\' at Coomassie fell on the day Sir Garnet Wolseley\'s force crossed the Prah. This has greatly perturbed the Ashantees, and it is therefore not at all surprising that they are anxious to make peace. It is impossible to tell what they will do at this moment. As I write, there are some 1,500 Ashantees two miles from us on the banks of the stream; but we are not likely to come to blows with them, at least till the messenger who left last evening has reached Coomassie. The Elmina chiefs attached to Wood\'s regiment say that King Koffee Kalcalli will never believe that we wish to sign a peace at Coomassie, but will think that our only reason for going there is to bombard the town. Nothing would suit us better than that. If the Ashantees should take up a position and attempt to hold it, any loss we are likely to suffer in fighting them will probably be considerably less than our loss from the effects of the climate. The 42nd had to send down an officer and thirty-two men from Prahsu, and the Rifle Brigade sent down fifty men in ten days.

The mission of these Envoys marks a stage in a series of negotiations. They are six in number, the chief amongst them being Prince A. A. Ossoo-Ansah, a son of Prince Ansah, who, in 1874, after the Ashanti War and the deposition of King Coffee, visited England for the purpose of clearing himself of imputations as to disloyalty to England during that war, and of obtaining compensation for the destruction of his property by the enemy. Prince Ossoo Ansah is the only one of the six who can speak English, and is appointed to act as interpreter and spokesman. The purpose of the visit has been stated in telegraphic despatches, but some fuller information is now available. It seems that the relations of Great Britain towards Ashanti have, with the sanction of the French Government, assumed somewhat new features, as it has been recognised as falling within the British sphere of influence. With the increased assurance of protection thus afforded, British traders have extended their operations in the country, which is extremely fertile in general produce, and especially rich in gold. The Governor of Cape Coast Castle, Sir W. Brandford Griffith, has consequently been led to propose the extension of British authority in a more formal manner—the establishment of a British Resident at the capital, Coomassie (or Kumasi). This step having been taken, the next would naturally be the definite conversion of the country into a British Protectorate. But to this idea a considerable number of the Natives have expressed the most decided objection; and it is with the idea of expressing the popular feeling upon this point that these six ""ambassadors"" have been appointed with the intention that they should seek an interview with the Queen, and lay before her Majesty the reasons why such a course would be so unpopular among their people.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-05-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_05_1895#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.698, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Good Relations with Ashantee: How to Restore and Maintain them', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following suggestions on this important subject have been made by one long resident on the Gold Coast.

But it would be necessary that the King should also be induced to send us a consul or agent, who ought to be well treated, and made acquainted with the refinements of European life. He should not be an ordinary chief or captain, but one of Ashantee\'s nobles, because there are many there. With this guarantee here, our Administrator could with every safety visit Ashantee, and display, in a dignified and graceful manner, the refined customs of Europe. The Africans are very imitative, and, depend upon it, good—real good—would be the result, such good as would outweigh 5,000l. per annum, if expended in the manner it ought to be.

Meantime, we repose the utmost confidence in the British General, officers, and soldiers; and we cherish the hope that we are about to emerge at an early date, and on good terms, from the conflict."" The address from which this extract is taken, is one of great power and intense interest, shadowing forth, as it does, changes of extreme importance to the whole British community, and which must influence materially the future destinies of the country. Nor have we any fault to find with the above observations relative to the Ashanti War, except in the paragraphs as to ""the establishment of friendship with the Ashantees,"" and ""the duty of avoiding in future the first entrance into equivocal and entangling engagements."" The latter is a fine phrase, meaning nothing, and copied out of Mr. Bright\'s textbook—a bad volume for a Minister to study as regards foreign relations. Should equivocal and entangling engagements appear to be necessary in the future, for forwarding some great object of Imperial policy, they will be entered into then as they have been entered into in the past. One unacquainted with the history of our connection with the Gold Coast countries, would imagine that, by some act of official stupidity, we had recently entered into engagements which had led to this Ashanti War. Nothing can be farther from the truth. Our engagements with the Gold Coast at this time—those engagements which have forced us into the present Ashanti War—are the unavoidable legacy of the foreign slave trade we ruthlessly carried on there for more than a century, and the efforts since made by the conscience-stricken British nation to put a final end to that abominable traffic. We were thus naturally led to, and detained on, the Gold Coast. We could not remain there without being supreme, and asserting and exercising our supremacy. In the exercise of this supremacy, we became naturally the protectors of the Gold Coast against enemies by sea or land. We consequently took upon ourselves the direction of its external relations, among the chief of which were those with Ashanti; and if there is now a war between us and Ashanti, that war is not the result of Fantee action, nor of ""our having entered into equivocal engagements,"" but of a culpable neglect and mismanagement on our part, the responsibility for which does not attach to the present Administration alone, but to many successive Administrations, which have chosen to shut their eyes to, and take no efficient measures to prevent, results which every unofficial person connected with those countries could foresee. Then, as regards friendship with Ashanti, as a result of the present advance on Kumasi. Should the Ashanti power survive the victory which we are bound to obtain over it at whatever cost, there could not be any friendship between it and us, except by a total change in its principles, customs, and character. Kumasi is a charnel-house, a slaughter-pen, where the blood of innocent human victims is incessantly flowing. Hitherto we have not been responsible for this, save that by a national effort, such as Ashanti has now forced upon us, we might have put an end to it. But if we entered into relations with it (after having conquered it) that would re-establish and perpetuate it, we should be responsible, and guilty as a nation, before God and man. Friendship between light and darkness is not less impossible than friendship, under such circumstances, between Christian Britain and the Ashanti which has been known of up to this present time. But our own opinion, expressed at the commencement of the present operations, and which we still retain, is that there will not be any danger of our falling into such a snare of guilty complicity with a murderous superstition, because the Ashanti power, losing all its prestige by our successful advance on Kumasi, will fall in pieces. It has only existed hitherto through the mutual jealousies of divers people, whom it has played one against another, while using them all for its aggressive operations. We may be mistaken; but this, we repeat, is our confirmed opinion; and it will be well for the Administration of which Mr. Gladstone is the head that this contingency should be maturely considered, in order that they may be able to deal in the most advantageous manner with the emergency should it arise.', 'last_edit_date': '1874-01-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_01_1874#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Some of the Lessons Taught by the Ashanti War', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Warriors, too, who have almost believed themselves to be invincible. The way in which they have finally resisted the advance of the little handful of British troops and native allies upon their capital, fully justifies the reputation they had obtained for personal bravery and military skill; while the uselessness of their resistance shows how completely all those countries in West Africa, within a hundred or two hundred miles of the sea-coast, are at the command of the civilized powers of Europe, of whom Great Britain alone has taken any real interest in their affairs. After the evidence which the Ashanti expedition has supplied, there cannot be a doubt—and there ought not to be a doubt in the mind of any native African authority—that 5,000 British troops, supposing they could be made secure from the evil influences of climate, and that they could obtain proper food and means of conveying sufficient ammunition, could traverse native Africa from east to west and from north to south, everywhere triumphant. Is not this a great lesson for West African potentates and other native authorities? The King of Dahomey will do well to take it seriously to heart, when meditating another grand diabolical ""custom,"" with its unspeakably horrifying human sacrifices; or another inroad into the Egba territory, in pursuance of his insane ambition or revenge against Abeokuta. Abomey is not more than half the distance from Whydah that Kumasi is from Cape Coast, and the country is much more accessible, open, and practicable for a body of troops. Christian Europe—now that Ashanti horrors have been so fully exposed, and, we will venture to hope, put an end to—will not much longer tolerate similar and even worse practices in Dahomey. We, at least, will do our part, that they shall not. If Great Britain does not interfere to put an end to them, some other European power will take possession of Whydah, and do so. It would be a conquest rich in mercantile results, while invaluable in the cause of outraged humanity and not a little important as regards facilities for introducing to the knowledge of those great truths, which can alone successfully combat and destroy the debasing and destructive sway of Satan, so long supreme over the vast countries of West and Central Africa. While thus giving warning to Dahomey, we should be greatly wanting in our duty if we did not give a word of advice—and we would have it looked upon as a large one—to our friends, the Egbas and Jebus. Our friendship for Abeokuta is too well known and has been too well evidenced for any one to deny or dispute it; we have given many and great proofs of it, and, therefore, we ought not to be misunderstood, when, with all our heart, we counsel and advise the authorities there and in Jebu, not to raise or prolong causes of contention with the British authorities in Lagos; or put forward pretensions which the well-known and, even in West Africa, sufficiently well understood principles by which British action and government is guided, must prevent her listening to. Egba, Jebu, their kings, authorities, and peoples, have nothing to fear from Great Britain, while they cultivate friendly relations with her Government in Lagos, and do all they can to facilitate and extend their trade with that place. But—and let them lay this well to heart—they can never be safe if they choose to pick quarrels with the Lagos Government. If this does wrong to them at any time, they may be sure that such is not the wish or intention of the Queen’s Government in England; and their representations, if made directly to it in a proper manner, will be sure to receive attention, because they will be seconded by us and other friends of Africa. We see a great and proud future for Abeokuta, and the Egba and Jebu countries generally, if they will but comprehend their true interests, and show themselves ready to second the English desires for the extension and development of trade and resources in them and beyond them. We have a mental view—we can see that future in our mind, though native African prejudice may prevent it from becoming a reality for yet a short time—we have a mental view of a good road, and soon after, even a rail or tram road, from the Lagoon, through Abeokuta, to Ibadan, in one direction, and to the Niger at Rabba, in another. These would make Abeokuta the great interior emporium of trade with the whole of that vast African interior, from the sea-side to the Niger, and the further side of that river; and Lagos, the great shipping port for all the produce—a hundred, aye, and many a hundredfold more than passes through her at this present time. This is an eventuality that must and will be realized. No opposition that native Africa can show, will prevent the progress of that great march of trade and commerce, which caters for the wants, and fulfils the demands of the civilized world that the natural resources of the whole earth shall be developed, and the products be made to minister to its use and enjoyment; while, in return, it imports its civilization and its wealth. The people of Jebu and Abeokuta do not at present comprehend the great advantage they have in Lagos being a British settlement. They do not seem to be conscious of the importance of the fact that this secures them at all times, upon certain and easy conditions, a safe port for their trade—a full security that the trade which must in time make Egba and Jebu, with their industrious populations, fat with wealth and riches, can never be interfered with by any other power; whereas, if Great Britain were not there, there is more than one other that might and would seek to conquer and keep possession of those countries, the undeveloped wealth and future possible importance of which is at last beginning to be understood and appreciated in Europe. No man can be a friend to Egba and Jebu who does not advise and entreat them to be always close friends with Lagos and its British authorities. Whatever his pretensions may be, if he counsel them to any other policy, any other course than this, he must be their enemy. In close alliance and friendship with Great Britain at Lagos, they have, as before observed, not only a happy present, but a glorious future before them—a future in which Great Britain will largely assist, and to which, without her friendship and aid, they can never attain. Close friendship with England means no more attacks by Dahomey; but possibly a subjection of Dahomey to Abeokuta. With the close friendship and alliance of Great Britain, this, and much more than this, is possible to a strong and determined people such as are the Egbas; while without it, they can never be free from uncertainty and danger.', 'last_edit_date': '1874-03-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/28_03_1874#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The British possessions of the Gold Coast extend over a coast line of about 350 miles, and are separated from the colony of Lagos by a short interval, which is filled up by a wedge of German, two wedges of French territory, and the narrow strip of independent Dahomie coast, which was until recently under the protection of the Portuguese. The inland limits of the Gold Coast colony are vague, and variable in extent. Behind our actual possessions, our political influence largely extends, and might be exercised much to the benefit of the interior were we less timorous about asserting it. In spite of several alterations in our Ashanti policy, we may consider the Ashanti kingdom as within the sphere of political influence. It would not be difficult to extend British influence from the Gold Coast right up to the great bend of the Niger, and thus secure them to British commercial influence. When we think of how much has been effected in the consolidation and extension of our Gold Coast territories since 1871, we may confidently hope for a further extension and a great future for this rich and important possession. The littoral of the Gold Coast is of the same moist equatorial character in its climate and scenery. The typical West African forest country ends, however, on the northern frontiers of Ashanti, and the characteristic park-like grass land scenery of Central Africa begins in the plains through which the Upper Volta flows. Beyond the Volta and the countries of Gyaman, Ashanti, and Brono, the inhabitants are mainly Mahommedans, and belong to a stock related to the Mandingos, although there is a large infusion of immigrant Hausa traders and fighting men. In some of these lands a proportion of the Hausa constabulary of the Gold Coast is recruited. Although the inhabitants of the Gold Coast belong almost entirely to what may be called the Ashanti family, yet increasingly the Hausa language is becoming the commercial tongue of the natives, although English has a great hold and is extending. The influence of the Hausa, no doubt, is aided by the presence of the constabulary, who are either recruited on the Niger or at the back of the Gold Coast. A most valuable arm they are likely to prove. They are very brave, very sober, and very loyal to their white officers.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH TRADE ON THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""So much for the western frontier. On the east we are similarly threatened by the Germans. They started with the possession of a small station at Beh, the people of which had long been desirous of entering the protectorate, but their offers were refused by the Government. This year a Commissioner was appointed to define the frontier. A line was decided on extending due north from the coast for a distance of over three miles into the interior. On this decision the Germans immediately annexed the Krepe country as far as the banks of the Volta. The Krepes were formerly in the Danish protectorate when we acquired Quittah and all the Danish possessions. Krepe went with the rest, yet we have allowed the Germans to annex the place. The sympathies of the natives are solely with the British. These German annexations are made by the advice and on the surveys of the Basle missionaries, who have for years been subsidised and protected by the British Government. For the rescue of some of their mission the Ashantee war was undertaken. The importance of these annexations will be seen when one has a knowledge of the trade routes to the interior, as it is upon the trade with the interior that the colony depends. There are three routes. The western is up the Tando River. A very large trade is carried on here, Ashanti being mainly supplied by this route. The command of the River Tando is lost if we permit the French to dispossess us of part of Apollonia and Aowin. The central route is via Cape Coast to Prahsu and Coomassie. A small trade is done here, owing to all the carriage being by land. This route is in British hands so far. The eastern, which will be the more important route, as by it most of the Mussulman trade is carried on, passes by the Volta through Krepe. Unless the Germans are dispossessed of this country, no British trade will be done this way. I hope you will call the attention of your Society to the neglect of British interests by the Government, and to the need for instant action, or else the whole of the British trade in these parts will fall into the hands of other European Powers.

We cannot conceive any reason why those countries should not contain some of those to-be blessed people, of whom we have thus made mention; and if they do so contain them, and these are to be reached only by the prostration and destruction of that most awfully blood-stained kingdom, this war will be made an instrument for opening the way to those who will willingly set forth with the glad tidings. Again, if they do so contain them, and they are only thus to be reached, the honour which God thus offers to our beloved country is in our eyes so great, as to outweigh a hundredfold any temporary pecuniary outlay, or any sacrifices far more painful, that the procuring of it may involve. And while we look at the progress of events during the last fifty years of our relations with the Gold Coast countries, we cannot avoid the conviction that there has been a gradual Divine preparation for Great Britain, of this honour which she has sought to repudiate and to avoid, even to the very verge of national dishonour. We believe that, however nations, and especially so-called Christian nations, may desire to live and act for their own ends, interests, and purposes alone, an overruling Divine Governor shapes that selfish life and purposes to the accomplishment of His own great supreme designs as regards the children of men. In the pursuit of that abominable object—the carrying on of a foreign slave trade, a cruel dealing in human flesh for gain—several European nations, and among them Great Britain, obtained sea-side settlements on the Gold Coast. We need not enter here upon any detail of the causes and events which led to the final extinction of that sinful trade there carried on. Suffice it to say, that by conquest and purchase, Great Britain became, with the Dutch, the only possessors of sea-coast dominions there; and that, finally, so late as 1872, the Dutch, compelled by native African pressure—which Great Britain not only did not aid or assist, but condemned and opposed—were glad to abandon all the posts they occupied, upon the mere payment to them by Great Britain of the money value of the stores they left behind them. A few words will suffice to show how important a difference was thus made in the position and responsibilities of Great Britain as regards the Protected Territories and Ashanti. The Ashantees are the hereditary and deadly enemies of the people of the Protectorate, whom they have long regarded as their rightful prey, and have sought to annihilate, that they might themselves enter into undisputed possession of these countries, and their coveted sea-coast. While the Dutch were joint possessors with the English of the sea-board of the Gold Coast, the latter were greatly restricted in their action. The Dutch were always friends and allies of the Ashantees. They had still a little slave trade of their own under another name, the victims of which were brought down from Ashanti. Whenever the Ashantees made an invasion of the Protected Territories, they received ammunition and arms, and all necessary supplies, through the Dutch towns. By the retirement of the Dutch last year, this was all changed, and we were brought face to face with Ashanti. In the furtherance of a most short-sighted and selfish policy, the British Government had of late years openly proclaimed that the people of the so-called Protectorate must in future depend upon themselves alone for their defence against their deadly enemy. This, too, while they still retained solely in their own hands the conduct of all relations with that enemy, which became thus British relations, and not theirs; while, too, they exacted obedience to all behests, so far as they chose, throughout the entire Protectorate; levied, collected, and retained for their own use the entire import duties, amounting, in 1872, to above 50,000l.; and not only refused to allow, but put down an effort at native union for defence against the Ashantees, for making roads and educating the people; and this, as it seemed to us, chiefly because it would necessarily involve their apportioning to the Fanti Confederation a share of the revenues they levied, and the formation of a native organized military force, not immediately under the command of the British Administrator. The Ashantees saw and knew of all this; they could not fail to do so, because the British administrative voice was continuously loud that all the people of the Protectorate could expect from them in any future invasion was a small supply of arms and ammunition. Was not this an encouragement by Great Britain to the Ashantees to invade the territories which she thus declared she would neither herself protect, nor allow the natives to organize efficiently to protect? It was such an encouragement, and was followed by just such results as might have been anticipated. We knew, of course, that, in the event of a formidable invasion, the British Government would be forced to take the field, sooner or later, against the aggressors, though the Ashantees believed that they would not; being encouraged therein by the British authorities treating for the ransom of the German missionaries whom they had kidnapped within the bounds of the Protectorate. And the British local authorities seem to have been of the same opinion; having, if we may judge by the course pursued, adopted Sir Charles Adderley's principles and ideas, that the British Government occupied their positions on the Gold Coast merely for purposes of trade; that it was quite indifferent to them whether the trade was with Fantees or Ashantees, and consequently that there was no reason why the Ashantees should not be allowed to annihilate the natives, and occupy their territories, provided always they respected those British positions, and would pay the Customs' duties levied there. The Ashanti monarch therefore sent the vanguard of his army across the River Prah early in December, 1872. They commenced by destroying the villages in their route. The King of Akim dispatched messengers in hot haste to Colonel Harley at Cape Coast, informing him of what had happened, of the imminent danger, and requesting a supply of arms and ammunition, that he might attack the invaders. Colonel Harley, however, was too fully imbued with Sir Charles Adderley's principles and ideas, to view these things in the same light as they appeared to the King of Akim. Instead of sending the prayed-for supplies, he ordered the King of Akim to abstain from all hostilities, unless he chose to incur the heavy displeasure of Her Majesty's Government. The result was what might have been expected. Encouraged by the absence of all opposition, fortified by Colonel Harley's pacific dispositions, in their belief that the Fantees were to be entirely given up to their tender mercies, the Ashantees flooded in. Time came, when their large army was within thirty or forty miles of Cape Coast (having destroyed some fifty or sixty villages), that Colonel Harley could not regard them any longer as ardent traders, coming down to fill the colonial chest with Customs' duties; but, still true to the Adderley principles and ideas, in sending up a couple of officers with some Houssas to inspect and report, he is understood to have ordered that under no circumstances should they fire a shot against the invaders. The Fantees had then advanced a large force against them. Those officers, with the Houssas, saw the Fantees overpowered in fight by them, yet abstained from giving any aid. Is it a matter of surprise that the Ashantees should at last have believed that not only had the British abandoned the Fantees to them, but that, with a little pressure, they would give up Elmina and Cape Coast Castle also, and leave the Gold Coast to their sole possession? We are merely showing how this Ashanti War has come about; that Great Britain has brought it entirely on herself, through the prevalence of dishonouring administrative principles and ideas, and the dignified incompetence of her local executive head; that she is forced into it against her will, through neglect of sacred and obvious duties; and that, as thus now acting in opposition to her own wishes and desires, she is—if she will now perform her duty adequately, persistently, and inflexibly—an instrument in the hands of an overruling Providence for working out a great intent. Ashanti has been a standing Satanic outrage against God and man. Her soil—and especially that of her capital town, Kumassie—is saturated with human gore—the incessant blood tribute relentlessly poured forth at the behests of a beastly superstition. Great Britain, though full of contempt and disdain for such a feeble and savage enemy—totally wanting in adequate military organization and armament to oppose her, and only difficult to conquer because the country to be traversed is without roads, furnishes none of the means of subsistence, and has a deleterious climate—has been compelled to enter the lists against her.

The progress of the Khartoum Relief Expedition, the better government of Egypt, the high-handed action of the Boers in Zululand, the activity of German aggression on the West Coast, and the vast possibilities involved in the systematic colonisation of the Congo territory, represent only a few of the more urgent considerations now forcing themselves on the country\'s attention.

Among the great divisions of the globe it occupies an absolutely unique position.

Little by little—the huge dimensions of the continent rendering encroachment almost imperceptible—England, led by the pioneers of her trade and commerce, has succeeded in laying the foundations of an African Empire that promises one day to eclipse the might, no less than the wealth, of the richest possession of the British Crown. But while this prospect has excited the envy, it has also stirred the emulation of other nations, and England apparently is not to be allowed to shape and wield the destinies of the ""Dark Continent"" either undisturbed or unopposed. Consolation may, however, be found in the thought that the development of responsibilities will be accompanied by an increase of strength and determination adequate to the demands of the occasion, while a special measure of assurance may be drawn from the decisive, though dangerously-delayed, measures now at last urged forward by the Government for the relief of General Gordon.

In former times sufficient attention was not always given by the authorities to the suitability of candidates for employment in the minor posts in these then much despised West African possessions. But all this has greatly changed. The growing importance of the West African trade, and the general éclaircissement which followed the operations of the Ashanti War, have brought about a different spirit in the administration of these colonies, and the present colonial service in West Africa is not inferior to any other branch of the service in other parts of the world, and of late has furnished a considerable proportion of remarkable men who have distinguished themselves on the West Coast of Africa, and have been raised to posts of great influence and distinction elsewhere. I think, however, that decidedly more might be done to encourage such work as I have referred to in Lagos, namely, a thorough and scientific examination of the natural history and ethnology of these lands, so that we can be better guided in our administration of them, both by increasing our knowledge of their natural resources and by becoming more acquainted with the character of the races whom we are to rule. Especially should the learning of native languages be fostered among colonial officers. This movement has been already begun on the Gold Coast by Sir Brandford Griffith, and in Lagos by Captain Moloney, but I do not think any official steps have been taken in the matter. In nearly all the great divisions of Africa there is some lingua Franca—some widespread language of general use among native traders, or the ruling caste, which would be understood everywhere, from Benin to Old Calabar, and up the Niger to its confluence with the Benue; the Yoruba tongue, which is prevalent throughout Logos colony and right away to the kingdom of Nupe; the Hausa language, which is a good deal spoken in the Gold Coast colony, and which is one of the leading tongues of the Niger basin; the Mandingo, which is widely spread as a commercial language over the Sierra Leone colony; and the Wolof, which is much spoken on the Gambia. In the learning of each one of these languages in their respective spheres of influence colonial officers should be encouraged by small bounties or some palpable reward. These languages are simple in construction, and are illustrated by grammars and dictionaries published by the various missionary societies.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ENGLAND AND HER WEST AFRICAN COLONIES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Turning to the question of the political administration of the Colonies at the present time, he enumerated the different systems of government prevailing in the various British Colonies in Africa, and said that the great benefits derived by the Colonies from their annexation to England, whose constitutional monarchy was the most stable system of representative government to be found in the whole world, were conspicuous and great. England had extended to her West African dependencies the privileges of British legitimate trade and commerce, which was a powerful vehicle for the advancement of civilisation.\n\nBringing forward the commercial advancement of the West African Colonies, he said the question had often been asked, ""Do the Colonies pay?"" He could answer with an emphatic affirmative. In 1837 the total external trade of England with all the Colonies was £28,341,471; it was now nearly £300,000,000, thus showing an increase of about ten times. The British shipping in connexion with the Colonies in 1837 was 3,677,975 tons; in 1885 it was 56,611,075 tons. The English Customs returns reckoned the exports to the Colonies in 1837 at £11,283,363; and this had since risen to £54,545,553. Her Majesty\'s Colonies, he said, furnished more than a quarter of the whole world\'s annual supply of gold. He then referred to the commercial geography of the British African Colonies, gave the value of their exports and imports, and reviewed the trade generally. The construction of a railway to the interior of Africa from Lagos was a recent proposition and a new feature in the history of the West African Colonies. It was obvious that Africa was, or would be, the only continent open for the future expansion of British manufacture; in such a case the interior would play an important part. He maintained, with eminent authorities on the subject, that by native agency alone, under foreign supervision necessarily, could tropical Africa be gradually and definitely developed on any permanent basis, and that the negro should be educated industrially and otherwise with the generous help of Europe and America. Whatever was accomplished by native agency, England certainly should carry the credit of effecting such accomplishment in the civilisation of Africa. It was beyond doubt that the English were acknowledged the best colonisers; and the marked consideration invariably shown by them to the people whom they undertook to govern, the extreme liberty and entire privileges of a British subject extended to every native, and the judicious caution characteristic of the policy of the British Government had altogether won for England this success and the preference to all other civilised nations.

Some of these which concern Great Britain have been already indicated, and will be continually dwelt upon until administrative measures shall show that they have had their due and proper influence, and will not be forgotten or useless. But it is not only for Great Britain and for the people of the Gold Coast Territories that this war is rich in important lessons. It is full of instruction for all the native authorities of Western Africa. Among the useful lessons which it ought to teach these native authorities, whatever their title, in any part where they may fancy they can indulge with safety in insults and injuries to the British Government, is this—that so immense are the resources of Great Britain, and so irresistible by any African people are her troops, offered as they are by men whom no danger or obstacles can deter in the path of duty; and armed as they are with those deadly weapons, and possessing those varied means of destruction with which advancing science has supplied the civilized nations of the world, that neither distance nor absence of roads, or other easy means of access, can prevent her power reaching and punishing them at her pleasure. The expedition to Abyssinia, a few years ago, showed this in a very strong light. But Abyssinia is a long way from the West Coast countries; and the native authorities of the latter are not very conversant with events occurring in countries, even the existence of which is scarcely known of or comprehended by them. It is, moreover, a universal truth that experience must be brought very near, for it to have its proper influence and effect. If the King of Ashanti had learnt the proper lessons taught by the Abyssinian campaign, he would never have held captive the German missionaries, or Mr. Dawson and his colleague, and others, or have sent his destructive hordes to invade the Protected Territories. Hateful as this war, which has consequently ensued, has been to us, it is, however, perhaps well that it should have been forced upon the British Government,—well, for the interests of humanity, which have been daily so outraged in that blood-deluged Ashanti; as, also, for those other great and still greater interests, to forward which, as soldiers of Christ Jesus, is the great hope and object of our life.

Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta.

The General History of Africa highlights instances where African leaders, such as Kabaka Mwanga II of Buganda, engaged with European powers in attempts to maintain sovereignty and stability. However, these efforts often resulted in treaties that undermined African sovereignty, as seen in Mwanga's treaties that transferred control of foreign affairs and taxes to the British. The textbook also notes that financial pledges, such as those related to the abolition of the slave trade, were used more as tools for colonial control than mutual respect, with divide-and-rule strategies exploiting African rivalries rather than fostering peace. In contrast, The African Times articles provide examples supporting the claim, such as the King of Ashanti's willingness to pay an indemnity in gold as part of a peace treaty with the British, reflecting financial pledges aimed at securing peace. The articles also mention treaties that respected territorial boundaries, like those involving the King of Ashanti, and British efforts to mediate peace among warring tribes in Sierra Leone and Lagos. However, they also acknowledge instances of British coercion, such as the ultimatum to the chiefs of Brass River. Together, these sources illustrate a complex interplay of financial, diplomatic, and sometimes coercive strategies employed by the British and local leaders to achieve peace and stability, with varying degrees of mutual respect and imposition of colonial rule.","The claim that the British and local African leaders sought peace and stability through financial pledges and territorial respect amidst colonial pressures is partially supported by the details in the General History of Africa textbook.

However, these efforts often resulted in the imposition of treaties that undermined African sovereignty, as seen in the treaties with Mwanga that transferred control of foreign affairs and taxes to the British government.

'If they want to help us', he instructed his ambassadors to ask, 'what repayment should we make them? Because I do not want to give them (or you) my land. I want all Europeans of all nations to come to Uganda, to build and to trade as they like.'$^{44}$ It is clear that in making a treaty, Mwanga did not mean to give up his sovereignty. Later, he was to discover, to his cost, that the Europeans thought otherwise. Captain F. D. Lugard's treaties with Mwanga in December 1890 and March 1892, which offered Mwanga 'protection', were imposed upon him rather than negotiated with him. It is true that the IBEAC did help to restore him to his throne but the victory of the Baganda Protestants (decided by Lugard's Maxim gun) over the Baganda Catholics at the Battle of Mengo (24 January 1892) had left the Kabaka in a very weak position. When the company ceased operations in Buganda (31 March 1893) it then transferred these treaties to the British government. Colonel H. E. Colvile's final treaty with Mwanga (27 August 1894) confirmed all the previous treaties. But it went further than them. Colvile demanded and secured for his country 'control of Foreign affairs and revenue and taxes' which passed from Mwanga 'to H.M.Govt., whose representative should also be the supreme court of appeal on all civil cases'.$^{45}$ In the same year Britain declared a protectorate over Buganda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'The Ngwato, Lozi, Sotho, Tswana and Swazi initiatives and reaction: the model of protectorate or wardship', 'content': 'Out of necessity, these kings acquiesced readily in Christianity and accepted protectorate status.

Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The structure of Volume VII', 'content': 'A great majority of African rulers, then, did opt for the defence of their sovereignty and independence.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey.

The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy. Asante must remain as of old at the same time to remain friendly with all white men. I do not write this in a boastful spirit but in the clear sense of its meaning ... the cause of Asante is progressing and there is no reason for any Asante man to feel alarm at the prospects or to believe for a single instant that our cause has been driven back by the events of the past hostilities. 2\nIn 1895, Wobogo, the Moro Naba, or King of the Mossi (in modern Upper Volta), told the French officer, Captain Destenave: I know that the whites wish to kill me in order to take my country, and yet you claim that they will help me to organize my country. But I find my country good just as it is. I have no need of them.

It is quite evident that Africans were faced with only two options, either to readily surrender their sovereignty and independence, or to defend them at all costs. It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.\nJohn D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty. To them, there could be no compromise on that, and indeed many of the leaders of these states chose to die on the battlefield, go into voluntary flight or face exile rather than surrender their sovereignty without a struggle.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': 'The European Scramble for East Africa and the patterns of African resistance > The response in Kenya', 'content': ""African response to all this was, as already indicated, both military and diplomatic, though at times there was withdrawal, non-co-operation or passivity. The Nandi in Kenya, for instance, resisted militarily the construc› tion of the railway through their territory. Of all the peoples of Kenya, they put up the strongest and longest military resistance to British im› perialism; it began in the 1890s and did not end until their leader was murdered by the British commanders in 1905, on his way to the negotiations which had been treacherously arranged. That event weakened Nandi resistance and eventually led to the British occupation of their territory.\nThat the Nandi resisted the British for over seven years was due to the nature of their society. Nandi society was divided into territorial units called pororiet. Warriors from each unit were responsible for the defence of the territory. For this reason, the warriors slept in a common hut. This was the nearest thing to a standing army. These territorial armies came together under the leadership of an orgoiyot, or traditional leader. It was he who decided when the army would go on a raid. The armies were linked to him through a personal representative who sat at each territorial council. Because territory rather than clan was the centre of Nandi social life, this meant that clan rivalry was absent. The result was a cohesive society, and it was this cohesion that gave the society military superiority over its neighbours. Maison writes that 'It is surprising that so small a tribe as the Nandi was able to terrorize much larger peoples and to continue to do so almost with impunity for several decades.' 11 Given the social cohesion of the society as well as the confidence of the warriors both in themselves and in their leaders, it is not surprising that they became a military power to reckon with. Their military successes led them to believe that they were superior to other people, white men included. As G. W. B. Huntingford noted, 'The Nandi thinks himself at least the equal, if not the superior of the whiteman; and any estimate of the changes brought about by the impact of our civilization must be considered in the light of this fact'.$^{12}$ The Nandi successfully resisted this occupation for over seven years, then, because of the success with which the society had been knit together as a fighting force."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The legacy of wars', 'content': 'In other words, while European powers were dealing with individual African states, recognizing them, befriending some and fighting others in Africa, in Europe they closed ranks along racial lines and formed a cartel to regulate the flow of essential arms to the Africans.

In South Africa, they even believed that they could appeal to the Queen of England and her direct representatives to carry out treaty obligations against the wishes of Anglo-Boer settlers and fortune seekers. Far from any notion of forging a pan-African solidarity similar to that pursued by the Europeans, each African state acted as seemed best in its own individual interest.\nIt appears that, if any factor is to be singled out, the basic explanation for this was to be found not only in the diplomatic abilities of the European strategists, but also in the legacy of wars that was part of the revolutionary situation of nineteenth-century Africa. It was the intensity of the rivalries and the bitterness of the wars that made African rulers slow to realize that tackling the European threat should have taken precedence over their inter› state rivalries, and that they should have united to face it.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""However, even in the inter-war period, labelled by contemporaries as one of 'colonial peace', military activities still punctuated African affairs in a severe manner. The professed European desire to keep Africa as militarily neutralized as possible was in fact never realized. The French introduced a law of conscription in 1919 whereby an African contingent of 10000 was to be annually obtained; the British developed a Sudan Defence Force, uniquely staffed by Sudanese as well as by British officers, but primarily directed to imperial strategic needs in the Near East as well as in East Africa. The Force Publique of the Belgian Congo, exhibiting the qualities both of occupation army and police force, was frequently used during this era to quell resistance expressed in the form of syncretistic religious movements.$^{29}$ On the scale of open warfare, events can be easily measured. The Italian campaign to subdue Libya in the 1920s and the Spanish and French effort to resolve the Rïf war in Morocco in the same period are obvious. But they are surpassed in scope by the rapacious war undertaken by Mussolini against the Ethiopians, an event with which the period here under consideration was tragically closed.\nThis account of military developments in Africa in the inter-war period does not seriously impair the assertion that divergent intentions of European colonial method and practice are those which, in retrospect, seem the most significant. There is little doubt that colonial bureaucratiza› tion did provide partial preparation for an unintended movement towards national independence. The configurations of a new political elite were slowly emerging, as lower-echelon clerks and appointed chiefs in various colonial services - but particularly the British - were learning to apply, if only modestly, Napoleon's imperative: 'careers open to talent'.

It appears that there is only one trading factory at Tabou, which is owned by a white man named Fitzwilliam Julio. This gentleman was absent when the Senegal was wrecked, but soon afterwards returned to the coast and called together the chiefs of the bush people, who had plundered the cargo and passengers. Mr. Julio held a palaver of a week's duration, and informed the natives of the serious nature of their conduct, and also that a British war vessel had been ordered to make inquiries, if not to burn down their villages. Mr. Julio managed to collect from the natives a number of documents belonging to the Senegal, and also a portion of the mails, but many had been destroyed by the natives, who were not aware of their value. The Icarus subsequently arrived, and, aided by Mr. Julio, the captain at once set about an investigation of the matter, a report of which will be submitted to the home authorities in due course. The captain evidently had no instructions to punish the natives; at all events, nothing was done by the Icarus to them. Tabou is an independent country, contiguous to the Liberian territory. The territory, however, is claimed by the Liberians, although the chiefs state they have documents which prove its independence. Reports had been made by the Liberian authorities to the captain of the Icarus that dynamite and other dangerous explosives had been imported into Tabou by Mr. Julio and his agents in order to incite the people of Tabou and Cavally against the neighbouring territory of Liberia. This matter was also investigated by the captain of the Icarus, and was found to be groundless, so far as the importation of dynamite was concerned, and the inciting of the natives to war. Cargo of so dangerous a nature as dynamite is not carried by the English steamers, and consequently could not be imported. It was also shown that the natives were desirous of living peaceably, so long as no designs were made upon their territory, or any attempt made by the Liberians to assume authority over it and impose duties. The wreck of the Senegal had entirely disappeared, owing to the action of the current where she stranded, and nothing can now be seen of her.

At last the efforts made have been crowned with success. The contending factions were grouped into two opposing sides. On the one side were the Ibadans, a powerful tribe situated right in the centre of the region of the war, and, therefore, surrounded by enemies; and on the other was a confederation of tribes under the general name of the Ekitiparapos. Man-catching was the real object of the war, and herein lay the great difficulty in the way of mediation; for it was obvious that none of the man-catching tribes would surrender their main source of revenue without a struggle. However, with the aid of two educated natives, a treaty of peace was signed in July, 1886, and ratified in the following September.\n\nThe first circumstance which opened up a prospect of successful mediation was an intimation received by Administrator Moloney, at Lagos, of a quarrel between the King of the Sebus and his people, the former wanting to continue the war and the latter to end it. It was not till long afterwards that Sir Samuel Rowe felt he was justified in interfering. His first attempt was not encouraging, but ultimately the Kings of the Ekitiparapos confederacy, twenty-six in number, appealed to the Governor, stating their grievances against the Ibadans, and asking him to prevent their being supplied with ammunition from Lagos through the agency of an Ibadan there.\n\nThe answer came from Mr. Moloney, who had assumed the government of the colony, and he addressed it to all the belligerents, rating them soundly for continuing the war, and offering his services as mediator. The replies were favourable. An armistice was arranged, and conferences were held. Statements setting forth the case for each tribe separately were forwarded to the Governor. In one of them (from the commander of the Jebus) the following passage occurs: ""Ile Ife is regarded by all our nation as the sacred spot from which we originated, and the Oni is respected as the father of all the Kings. This is why the Jebu King felt it his duty to reinstate the Ifes in the town. It was from Ile Ife that his father went to settle in the Jebu country. His father did not die, but he was converted into a rock, which could still be seen. Even the English King can be shown the spot at Ile Ife from whence his ancestors went out.

As it was of importance to Great Britain, who had already secured the remainder of the Niger, to prevent this mouth of it falling into the hands of any foreign Power, the British Consul at that time promised he would do all that lay in his power in the matter, and a temporary treaty was, on this understanding, signed for a period of six months. Nothing, however, was done in the matter by the British authorities, and when this treaty expired in July of last year no consular authority existed in any part of this coast, so that no steps were then taken either to renew it or to get a permanent one signed. However, Mr. Consul Hewett returned to the West Coast of Africa about six months ago, armed with instructions from Her Majesty\'s Government to take the necessary steps to place the Brass River and the territory in connexion therewith under British protection, and he accordingly made a preliminary visit here in September to hold a ""palaver"" with the kings and chiefs on the subject. On that occasion those personages did not put in an appearance, but the Consul informed them in writing that he would shortly return to negotiate a treaty with them, and that it was the opinion of the British Government that the principles of free trade should be carried out, and that the people of Brass were at liberty to trade wherever they chose. This message by no means satisfied the chiefs of this river, as the National African Company took care that they should not trade in any of the waters under its jurisdiction. Shortly afterwards, the Consul received a message to the effect that they did not intend to part with their country unless they obtained further privileges. Hence the recent visit of the Consul. Shortly afterwards the Consul summoned them to a ""palaver"" on board the *Watchful*—a summons which they neither answered nor obeyed.

The public meetings held, the lectures and addresses delivered, have amounted to upwards of 350, besides a large number of special sermons on peace delivered by various ministers, at the suggestion of the Committee. The Press has been utilized in various ways. Publications of all sorts, from the octavo volume to the two-paged tract have been issued in a steady stream. The system of supplying newspapers and periodicals with paragraphs bearing on peace and war has, through the kindness of editors, been carried out with great effect. The Ladies' Auxiliary Branch and the Workmen's Peace Association have also been in active operation. A new method of interesting the young in the subject has been adopted by offering prizes to young persons in schools for the best essays on topics connected with the question. The report congratulates the friends of peace on the conclusion of the Afghan war. After spending twenty millions of money in scattering havoc and devastation through that land, we have had to retreat within our own borders, our present rulers having had the courage to withdraw from a position as perilous as it was unjust. The report relates the steps taken by the Committee in reference to the Transvaal question, their deputation to Lord Kimberley, the meetings held in various parts of the country, the memorials presented to the Prime Minister; and they refer to the manner in which the Government, to its infinite honour, persevered in its peace negotiations, even in the face of reverse and defeat. It warns the country against being misled by the wild and alarming reports sent home by a certain class of African colonists who detest the peace, and are bent upon rekindling a war which would subserve their interests at the expense of the mother country, which will have to bear the cost. The report next speaks of M. Richard's motion in the House of Commons, in June last, in favour of a mutual reduction of armaments, which, after eliciting an interesting discussion and an admirable speech from Mr. Gladstone, was carried, not in the original form proposed but in an amended form suggested by Mr. Bright. It refers also to the other Parliamentary resolution, submitted by Mr. Richard last month, on the conduct of British representatives abroad, in contracting engagements and making war without authority from the central Government, which also called forth a most valuable speech from the Prime Minister, and was lost on a division by a majority of only eight in a House of 137. The report dwells with satisfaction on the general interest which the discussion had excited in the Press, as evidenced by the serious and, for the most part, favourable comments of most of the London and provincial papers. It, however, condemns and deplores the continuance of the Basuto war. Finally, it alludes with satisfaction to the frequency of the cases which now occur of states settling their disputes by arbitration, or some form of peaceable reference, instead of an appeal to the sword. Three such instances have taken place during the past year. A difference between France and the Republic of Nicaragua was, by the wish of the latter, referred to the arbitration of the French Court of Cassation. The states of Chili and Columbia have signed a convention, submitting a dangerous dispute between them to the President of the United States. And still more important is the convention between the United States of America and the French Republic, referring a variety of contending claims existing between the two Governments to three commissioners, one to be nominated by the President of the United States, one by the French Government, and the third by the Emperor of Brazil, all which, it is contended, are significant indications that civilized Governments are gradually awaking to a sense of the reasonableness of adjusting their differences by other means than the brutal arbitrament of war."", 'last_edit_date': '1881-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1881#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'If we have not parted with the energy and resolution which, as a Government and people, have characterised us of old, if we shall frame and carry out a sensible, settled policy in these regions, yielding to no sentimental clamour from false philanthropists, nor ignoring the just rights of the natives and our responsibility towards them as their guardians and instructors, we shall make of Western Africa another India, equally worthy of renown and equally profitable to our trade.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

Great Britain, on the other hand, has adopted the policy of advance by commercial enterprise. She has not attempted to compete with the military operations of her neighbour. The punitive expedition to Ashanti of 1873, necessary for the protection of the Gold Coast Colony, has been the sole exception to this pacific policy. Nevertheless, as the upshot of it, the British Government have made substantial progress. While guarding the stability of the old colonies, they have added to them the whole territory of the Oil Rivers, where by breaking down the restrictive system of the native middlemen, they have given an important impulse to trade, which is evidenced by the growing interest of the Chambers of Commerce; and the spirit and energy of the Royal Niger Company have, without the expenditure of Imperial funds, or the sacrifice of the life of a single British soldier, placed under the protection of the Crown, the whole of the Lower, a great portion of the Central, Niger, and its affluent, the Benue, up to Yola.

But the presence of a common enemy is sure to drive them into alliance together. And let us remember the native mind does not grasp the difference between one European power and another. It is not in the interests of the Arab to enlighten them—on the contrary, it is clearly to his advantage to persuade them that all Europeans are bent upon their destruction. The Arab influence in East Africa is already immense. The chief obstacle to its further development lies in the hostility of the native tribes, who have trusted Europeans in preference, because they found that these have been just and considerate; but according to latest accounts, the Germans seem bent upon changing all this, and forcing the natives to make common cause with the Arabs.

Consequently he received instructions from, and reported to both the Department of War and the Department of Interior (neither of which co-ordinated with the other). Liberia's military weakness markedly contrasted with Ethiopia's military might and largely accounted for Liberia's inability to defend her territory from encroachment by Europeans during the Scramble."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': ""Economic and social developments and European intervention in Liberia's and Ethiopia's internal affairs, 1880-1914 > Liberia"", 'content': ""Side by side with European encroachments, Liberia faced serious internal economic and social problems.

Up to 1914 most of the commissioners were Americo-Liberian or educated indigenous Liberian military officers. The administration was largely oppressive and corrupt. Most of the district commissioners, their aides, and troops, being poorly and irregularly paid, and seldom supervised from Monrovia, lived off their districts by extorting food, labour for their private farms, and excessive fines and taxes (above the official one dollar poll-tax on adult males, and labour required for public buildings and roads). 65 Not surprisingly, the indigenous Africans resisted not only their military subjugation to Liberian government authority - just as Africans elsewhere resisted subjugation to European rule - but also the excesses of the Liberian administration. Until subjugated by the Liberian militia, the Liberian Frontier Force and American naval ships, the Kru resisted intermittently, and particularly in 1915-16; the Grebo resisted in 1910; the Kissi in 1913; the Kpele and Bandi, 1911-14; the Gio and Mano, 1913-18; the Gbolobo Grebo, 1916-18; the Gola and Bandi, 1918-19; the Joquelle Kpele, 1916-20; and the Sikon in 1921. These protracted wars on different fronts and the cost and inefficiency of the 'native administration' encouraged foreign intervention and strained the government's human and material resources. 66 The government's revenues were never adequate. Foreign aid was meagre. Most Americo-Liberians preferred trade to agriculture and were seriously hurt by the worldwide depression of the late nineteenth century. By 1890 resident German, British and Dutch merchants dominated Liberia's external trade. Coffee, Liberia's major export commodity since the 1860s, was produced mostly by Americo-Liberian planters and entrepreneurs using both Recaptive and indigenous African labour.

The central governments of both had internal opponents who sought to exploit the situation of foreign intervention for their own purposes by allying with the foreign powers, notably the opposition People's Party in Liberia, and feudal nobles like Leul-Ras Hailu and Dejazmatch Haile Sellassie Gugsa. I2S Both countries, although not lacking in ardent patriots ready to defend the Fatherland at the cost of their lives, were militarily very weak compared with the military might of their potential or actual foreign aggressors. The Liberian militia of all able-bodied men - mostly Americo-Liberians - was largely irregularly trained and lacked arms. The Frontier Force, Liberia's standing army, was similarly poorly trained and armed, and irregularly and poorly paid and provisioned. In September 1920, for instance, arrears of salaries due to both the officers and men of the Force amounted to $90689.52, which greatly lowered their morale.$^{126}$ Discipline and training of the Force was reported to be so unsatisfactory that it was 'extremely difficult to get an order carried out either in letter or spirit'.$^{127}$ The Force numbered altogether 821 men in November 1917, 767 in December 1920, and 744 in December 1925. In 1935 a Liberian author described Liberia as 'not more than an infant' in matters of self-defence: she had no navy or air fleet. 128 As for Ethiopia, her armed forces consisted of feudal levies of the gover› nors and shums, the troops of the central government, and Haile Sellassie's own standing army.$^{129}$ Only the last was trained and armed in the modern manner.

In answering this question, it is important to bear in mind that up to the end of 1935, neither Liberia nor Ethiopia enjoyed any uncompromising sympathy, support or protection from the foreign powers within or outside the League of Nations, or of the League itself. In spite of its acknowledged, traditional friendship with Liberia, the United States demonstrated numerous times over during the forced labour crisis that it toed the line of the European colonial powers who had designs on Liberia's sovereignty, particularly in supporting the plan for an international governing commission over Liberia.\nThe great diplomatic competence of the Liberian Government, particu› larly of Liberia's brilliant intellectual President, Edwin J. Barclay, and Liberia's negotiator in Geneva and Secretary of State, Louis A. Grimes, should also be taken into account. By silencing local opposition by force or persuasion, and by most doggedly holding to the principle of selfdetermination for Liberia, the Liberian leaders promoted the cause of their country's sovereignty. However, since Ethiopian leaders including Haile Sellassie were also competent in diplomacy and ardent guardians of their country's sovereignty, the survival of Liberia seems to dwell ultimately in the fact that Ethiopia had a mad, blood-thirsty imperial power as a neighbour who was bent on territorial aggrandizement and above all on avenging Adowa, and therefore on actually attacking Ethiopia.

In January 1932 the Brunot Commission also presented its Report to the League. Its recommendations were similar in many respects to those of the Christy Commission but less unfavourable to Liberia on the whole. Traditional African communal labour was to replace forced labour for public works; the indigenous Liberians were to be granted an undisputed ownership of their lands, the authority and dignity of the African chiefs were to be upheld by the Liberian government, and the education of the indigenous Liberians and the means of communication with the Liberian hinterland were to be improved. The hinterland was to be divided into three provinces to be administered by foreign provincial and deputy commissioners under whom would be Liberian county super› intendents and district commissioners. The commission also suggested that for Liberia's finances to improve reasonably, Firestone would have to modify the terms of the loan agreement of 192o. 93 This intervention in Liberian affairs by the League significantly in› creased the opposition to the Liberian Government of many indigenous Liberians, particularly the Kru, Grebo and Vai. Many of them believed that the 'white men' would soon take over the Liberian government from the Americo-Liberians; hence they ceased to pay taxes or perform forced labour on public projects like road building. Simultaneously, some of them revived intra-ethnic conflicts over disputed boundaries, farmlands and chieftainships.\nTo maintain peace and order, President Barclay sent a detachment of the Liberian Frontier Force to the Kru and Grebo districts in May 1931 with specific instructions to its Americo-Liberian commander, Colonel T.

We have been long ago convinced that the English Government would never have gone to all the trouble it has unless it had designs looking to territorial aggrandizement southward of Sherbro\'. That Government now gives plain utterance to that at which its agents have been hinting a long time ago. The Liberian Government has not been wise in its generation. It has attempted to trade upon the supposed philanthropy of its rival, and it is likely to suffer in consequence. If Liberia does lose her northern territories, it is to be hoped that her statesmen will take to heart the lesson that from the day she declared her independence she was expected to have learned: that the era of philanthropy for her was over. She was to fight her own battles, look out for her own interests, stand up for her own rights. Failing to do this, she would suffer the consequences. Now in all the controversy about our North-west boundary we have blindly followed the path traced out by the English Government. We have done nothing that it was thought would offend. Their traders went into Mannah country. We enforced the laws they had ignored, were threatened with chastisement, paid an indemnity, saying we should protest, which we never formally did, and now we are told that we never protested—therefore it is an admission against us. Previous to the time of the Sulymah meeting, the English sent agents into the territory to collect evidence adverse to us, and paid for such evidence. We, although we had strong backers in the disputed territories, never made an effort to look after our interests and strengthen our case. Nor did we raise a single objection to the proceedings of the English Colonial Government. It might displease them; they would do right. Well, they have done right. They have cooked up a spurious claim made by a lot of exceedingly doubtful character, purporting to have been sworn in before magistrates influenced by traders known to be anxious for the acquisition of the country by Great Britain; and now they say, ""This is good claim; we must believe our citizens and our magistrates in preference to yours; give up the territory for the claim."" That the Cabinet was actually ready to fall in with the views of the English is heart-rending. Without animadversion, it certainly can be said with truth that they have disappointed the country. The protest transmitted by the citizens of Monrovia to the President truthfully points out the reason why we cannot accede without at least a struggle to the demands of the English Government. It would be but the beginning of the end. The territorial acquisitions which Great Britain contemplates making at our expense would practically place the northern boundary of Liberia at the St. Paul\'s River. Everything that can be done should be resorted to avert such a disaster, and we do hope the Government, which now seems to be asleep, will awake and strive to inaugurate a policy conservative of the interests of the country.""'}, {'id': 6218, 'article_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'full_section_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'last_edit_date': '06-01-1892', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1892#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_06_1892', 'content': ""The first Governor, Buchanan, died in 1841, and was succeeded by Governor Roberts, whose name is well known in connexion with Liberian history. The civilised population at this time numbered about 5,000, but Liberia's position as a State in Africa resembled that of its founders as individuals in America. It had no legal existence among the nations. This fact was made apparent by the refusal of foreign ships to pay the duties imposed by its Legislature. The natives of the coast continued to harass it in consequence of its opposition to the slave trade, until the new State found itself between an upper and a nether millstone. Governor Roberts applied himself to overcome each difficulty in turn. He succeeded in persuading the native chiefs to appreciate the advantages of civilisation, and a number were induced to federate for the purpose of abolishing slavery and introducing orderly administration within their borders. The federated body shortly afterwards entered the colony, and in 1845 the territory of the Kroomen was annexed by friendly treaty, thus adding a third county, under the name of Sinou, to the two which already existed. The colony now extended to Grand Sesters. Maryland also widened the area of her administration, and the entire coast was occupied from Cape Mount to San Pedro. The two colonies resolved to make a joint effort at self-assertion. They imposed an ad valorem customs duty of 6 per cent. upon foreign imports, but English merchants refused to admit the right of the Liberians to impose duties, and insisted upon trading freely as with a savage territory. An English ship was seized and detained by the Liberian authorities. It was rescued by force, and the English Government refused to recognise the Liberian Executive. Liberia had no position except as a dependency of the United States, and the prejudice against colour in America caused that Government to give only lukewarm support to the African colony. If it were to exist at all, it was necessary that it should assert its individuality and claim for itself the rights which were denied to it. Under these circumstances the American Colonisation Society came to the resolution to abandon all rights over its protégé and advised it to take its fate boldly into its own hands. A Republican constitution was drawn up, and on August 24, 1847, the existence of the Republic of Liberia was announced to the world.""}]","[{'document_title': 'OFFICIAL IRREGULARITIES OF THE LIBERIAN GOVERNMENT.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""I regret to address you upon the subject of certain proceedings on the part of the Liberian authorities in the Mannah River district, on the West Coast of Africa, which have caused Her Majesty\'s Government much pain, and which threaten seriously to impair the friendly relations that have so happily existed between this country and Liberia since the establishment of the latter as an independent state. In the month of September, 1868, however, without any notice having been previously given by the Liberian Government to that of Her Majesty, of their intention to enforce their claims to the disputed territories, a large party of armed natives acting under Liberian authorities, made their appearance in the Mannah River district, where they seized and carried off to Monrovia the British schooner Elizabeth, and after maltreating them, plundered the stores of British traders on shore. Such high-handed proceedings towards the subjects of a country, which had invariably afforded its protection and assistance to the Liberian Republic, could not, under any circumstances, be but considered as unfriendly. But those proceedings assume a much graver form where, as in the present instance, the Liberian Government has been informed that Her Majesty\'s Government do not acknowledge the territorial claims, and in the face of this warning, the Liberian authorities proceed to assert their assumed rights by seizing and confiscating British property, and by imprisoning and maltreating British subjects.\n\n""The Governor-in-Chief of Her Majesty\'s settlements on the West Coast of Africa has already made a strong representation to the Liberian Government upon the subject of the proceedings of their authorities in the Mannah district, but the only satisfaction he has obtained has been an offer on the part of Liberia to submit their claims to the disputed territory to the arbitration of the United States, and this offer, until redress has been afforded for the outrage committed on British subjects, Her Majesty\'s Government can in no wise accept. Sir Arthur Kennedy will now be directed to proceed in a ship of war to Monrovia, with the view to procure the restitution of the British vessel that was seized in the Mannah river, and also reparation for the wrongs inflicted on British subjects; and in the event of the Liberian Government refusing to accede to the just demands of Her Majesty\'s Government, he will place the matter in the hands of Her Majesty\'s naval authorities, who will proceed to act as the exigencies of the case may require.""', 'last_edit_date': '1870-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1870#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Proposed Settlement of the Liberian North-west Boundary Question', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following is a leading article in the Liberian paper, the _Observer_, on the North-west Boundary Question: ""We hope all the wiseacres are satisfied about the benevolent intentions of the English Government. We have been long ago convinced that the English Government would never have gone to all the trouble it has unless it had designs looking to territorial aggrandizement southward of Sherbro\'. That Government now gives plain utterance to that at which its agents have been hinting a long time ago. The Liberian Government has not been wise in its generation. It has attempted to trade upon the supposed philanthropy of its rival, and it is likely to suffer in consequence. If Liberia does lose her northern territories, it is to be hoped that her statesmen will take to heart the lesson that from the day she declared her independence she was expected to have learned: that the era of philanthropy for her was over. She was to fight her own battles, look out for her own interests, stand up for her own rights. Failing to do this, she would suffer the consequences. Now in all the controversy about our North-west boundary we have blindly followed the path traced out by the English Government. We have done nothing that it was thought would offend. Their traders went into Mannah country. We enforced the laws they had ignored, were threatened with chastisement, paid an indemnity, saying we should protest, which we never formally did, and now we are told that we never protested—therefore it is an admission against us. Previous to the time of the Sulymah meeting, the English sent agents into the territory to collect evidence adverse to us, and paid for such evidence. We, although we had strong backers in the disputed territories, never made an effort to look after our interests and strengthen our case. Nor did we raise a single objection to the proceedings of the English Colonial Government. It might displease them; they would do right. Well, they have done right. They have cooked up a spurious claim made by a lot of exceedingly doubtful character, purporting to have been sworn in before magistrates influenced by traders known to be anxious for the acquisition of the country by Great Britain; and now they say, ""This is good claim; we must believe our citizens and our magistrates in preference to yours; give up the territory for the claim."" That the Cabinet was actually ready to fall in with the views of the English is heart-rending. Without animadversion, it certainly can be said with truth that they have disappointed the country. The protest transmitted by the citizens of Monrovia to the President truthfully points out the reason why we cannot accede without at least a struggle to the demands of the English Government. It would be but the beginning of the end. The territorial acquisitions which Great Britain contemplates making at our expense would practically place the northern boundary of Liberia at the St. Paul\'s River.

The last advices received from Liberia show that there is much excitement in Monrovia over the encroachments of the French at Cape Palmas. The French crossed the frontier of Ashantee into Liberian territory and established military stations, which they have refused to leave. Unfortunately, there is no Power to which Liberia can look for protection, unless to the United States. The country is prosperous, and is making great headway in the direction of civilization and wealth; but the fear that the Republic will be swallowed up by some European Power tends greatly to check the progress and development of the country. The Republic is a market for almost every kind of American manufactured goods and of foods. In return the United States gets its palm oil, palm kernels, dye woods, ivory, and coffee, and should a line of steamers be established to run regularly between New York and Liberia the country might become a centre for the shipping of many of the products of Africa, its chief port being convenient as a central depot from which they could be shipped to the United States. The caravans which bring ivory and other products from the interior of Monrovia return bearing American calico, bacon, and general manufactures; but as yet the only means of direct communication between Liberia and the United States is a line of sailing vessels. The mails are brought indirectly by way of England, and are very irregular. What Liberia desires is that the United States should present the Republic with one of its old warships, which, even if not very effective, would at least have some effect in protecting the country from the encroachments which are now going on.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Liberian Republic', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The shores of this part of the world (Harper, Liberia) present a solitary and melancholy appearance. Bush is all that meets the eye, while not a sail is to be seen as far as the eye can reach. There are no towns of any size between Grand Bassa and Harper, but merely a few villages scattered at intervals along the coast. Harper is situated on Cape Palmas, and has a harbour immediately opposite, which is sufficiently commodious and affords ships cruising in this part of the world a pleasant change after the eternal surf of the West African shores. The town looks uncommonly well from the sea. The church spires peep out from amongst the trees, and the shingle-framed houses of the Liberians surrounded by gardens add picturesqueness to the scene. Harper possesses, besides old churches, an academy, a hospital, an orphan asylum, and a lighthouse. The latter is more of ornament than use, as the Republic cannot afford to keep it constantly lighted. Adjacent to the lighthouse is the flagstaff which bears the Liberian national flag, the same as the American ensign, with the exception that instead of many stars there is only one. The practically prohibitive taxation at present imposed by the Government will end in the withdrawal of all Europeans from the country, as it is now an impossibility to get at the interior of the country, and the amount of trade that can be indulged in at the open ports is not sufficiently remunerative in view of the heavy taxation imposed. At present the German traders are anxiously expecting the arrival of the German squadron from Europe, when they are hoping the Admiral in command will bring the requisite pressure to bear on the authorities to induce them to open out to them the interior of the country. The people here may be called prosperous; if they would not ape white men\'s ways, they would be all the better. Some are well educated, and quite *au fait* in the politics of the world, but they appear to have a great dislike to foreigners of any kind, and a wish to keep Liberia wholly and solely for the Liberians. It should be pointed out that the effect of present restrictions is to keep Liberia utterly impotent to enforce her authority within her territory, and to prevent her doing anything to advance the material condition of the country, and that if this policy be persisted in, the inevitable result would be that Liberia would be absorbed by a European Power. The Americans washed their hands of a Liberian protectorate years ago, and are not likely to embroil themselves with any Power over such a figment as ""Liberian independence."" The officials of the Republic are wretchedly paid. The Governor of Harper\'s income is only about £75 a-year; his house is furnished in the meanest style, and he appears to augment his salary by supplying ships with fresh provisions. The constitution of Liberia, as well as the institutions, the manners and customs of the people, and the language itself, appear to be modelled upon those of the United States. The pure Liberian guesses and calculates quite as much as do his white brothers in New York, and speaks with that nasal twang peculiar to the land of the stars and stripes. Manhood suffrage is one of the Liberian institutions, but this ""manhood suffrage"" involves the qualification of being possessed of real property to the extent of fifty dollars. Harper exports little but palm oil, and that little appears to be dwindling to still lower limits. The inhabitants appear to take a deep interest in politics, and elections and the state of parties seem to create as deep and universal interest here as in more civilized countries. A Liberian youth of sixteen or so being asked how often the President was elected, replied ""biennially,"" and proceeded to give an account of the political institutions of the country, which showed that the education of the Liberian youth is thorough, and embraces politics as well as more widely-taught subjects. The President of the Republic resides at Monrovia, the capital, where the Houses of Assembly sit. The salary attached to the Presidential office is only £400 a-year and a residence—not a very magnificent sum, but large enough in this country, where living is cheap, the expenses of life small. The solitary Englishman in Liberia is located at a place called Tabon, and is engaged in trading with the natives. He has for some time refused to pay the exorbitant taxes assessed upon him, and the Government has no force to compel him, with the result that many of the natives are inclined to follow his example. As the Government has no means of transport, they are unable to send any troops from Monrovia to Tabon, from which it is distant about 200 miles, and, probably, even if they could, they would hesitate to do so from fear of complications with the English Government, especially as the boundaries of Liberia are not at present clearly defined, and her Majesty\'s Government has declined to recognize any portion of the country to be Liberian territory when the Government of the country is not capable of enforcing its authority. The officials say that the President has invoked the assistance of the United States, and that an American ship is at present on its way to Tabon, to set matters right; but the Americans are much too cute to trouble themselves over such a paltry matter. A wide and deep river runs into the sea here, but it is ruined by a bar at its mouth, which prevents navigation. This matters little at the present time, but in the future, when Liberia has been annexed or roused from its present state of stagnation, means will probably be found to obviate this fatal impediment to navigation, both here and elsewhere, along the coast. A very few miles off, another large river—the Carallo—discharges itself into the sea, and is likely to become of great commercial importance in the future, as gold washings have been found on its banks. This river has been ascended for nearly 200 miles, and is stated to be navigable for that distance. This country is more valuable in every way than our Gold Coast Colony: it possesses three or four fairly good harbours, whereas the latter cannot boast of one. There is an absence of that terrible surf which makes landing or the transference of cargo almost impossible, and the country itself appears to be more productive, to have greater mineral wealth, and to ""tap"" a more valuable part of the Dark Continent. The estimated population of Liberia is about 767,000, only about 30,000 of whom are descendants of freed slaves from the United States, the remainder being the aborigines or ""heathen,"" as they are termed by the ""Liberians.""', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Great Britain was the first Power to hold out a helping hand, and a British man-of-war was sent to Monrovia to offer a salute of twenty-one guns to the new flag. The other European Powers, one after the other signified their recognition of the Republic. America added her recognition in 1862. President Roberts, who undertook a tour through Europe for the purpose of obtaining the recognition of the Powers, was well received in England, and was not only able to conclude a commercial treaty, but was accepted as an ally in the prosecution of the campaign against the slave trade on the West African coast, and was presented with a gunboat to enable him to carry on the repression of the traffic in Liberian waters. He, in 1849, took an active part in an expedition of the Powers against the slade traders, who had their headquarters in the northern territory lying between Liberia and Sierra Leone. It was felt that if the whole coast could be held under anti-slavery supervision the trade might be extirpated, and in 1850 the West Coast territory to Cape Turner was purchased from the owners and placed under the guardianship of Liberia. Robertsport was founded this year, and commemorates the name of the President. The population of the Republic was rapidly increasing, her territory was extended towards the interior by treaties with the chiefs, and in 1857 the colony of Maryland was by its own request annexed. They now form together the United States of Liberia. Trade and agriculture were encouraged, and order, justice, and civilised institutions spread through the Republic. The restriction by which white men were forbidden to hold land was also removed. Towns were multiplied and exploration of the interior began to attract attention. In 1868 and 1869 Benjamin Andersen carried out his expedition to Musardon, which resulted in the acquisition by treaty of territory reaching as far as 9:30 north latitude in the sources of the Upper Niger.\n\nFrom the date of the public loan raised in 1871, when the affairs of the Republic were no longer under the direction of its first President, the history of Liberia has been less prosperous. Internal revolution followed upon financial trouble; and quarrels have taken place with England on the subject of the northern territory, in which there was no alternative for the lesser Power but submission; and the present boundary was arranged in 1883.

Five hundred, perhaps, at the most. It lies far away from the routes pursued by tourists, and the busy world hears little and knows less of the independent negro State which nestles in a corner of the West African Coast and has been the scene of a series of experiments absolutely unique in history. It was from this part of the African coast that some attempt was to be made to develop the Dark Continent. Emancipated slaves from the United States, now citizens of a republic established by themselves in the land of their forefathers, were to be the torchbearers of civilisation and to carry the lamp of learning to their brethren in the interior. Such was the scheme of the large-hearted and liberal philanthropists who, early in the present century, founded the various colonisation societies in the United States with a view of enabling its negro population to found settlements on the West Coast of Africa. These settlements were gradually formed, and, after passing through a series of trials, eventually confederated. In 1822 the republic was declared, and in 1847 Liberia was recognised as an independent State by the sovereigns of Europe and the United States Government. From Washington the new State borrowed its constitution. Although she has enjoyed the advantage of having had at least three Presidents—E. Johnson, Russworm, and Roberts—of high character and executive ability, it would be untrue to say that the hopes of the founders of Liberia have been realised. On the contrary the Liberian Government seems to have entirely failed to win the confidence or even to gain the respect of the native kings and tribes within its supposed ""sphere of influence""; indeed, some of them resist all attempts to enforce authority within the ill-defined boundaries of the State. At the recent inauguration of the new President—the Hon. — Cheeseman—it was a matter of general satisfaction that a gunboat, ordered from a Keil dockyard, was on her way out from Germany. This boat is to be the foundation of the new Liberian Navy, and, strange to say, it is required, not for the defence of the State, but to coerce a British merchant who for three years has declined to pay customs duty on the ground that he receives no protection from Government, that there is no civilised administration in the district in which he resides, and that he is compelled to employ and pay a police force of his own. The Government, urged by German merchants to suppress their independent competitor, has signified its intention of resorting to force, and will probably find itself in a difficulty with our Foreign Office if a single shot is fired on an English factory whose owner is considered to have made out a good case for non-payment of duty. The attempts of Christian missionaries to evangelise the Western districts of Africa have been discouraging. From the year 1481, when some priests from Rome unsuccessfully endeavoured to withstand the climate, the history of Christian labour is one continuous narrative of a futile struggle against disease and death. Protestant societies in the United States have literally poured dollars by thousands into Liberia. Some good work is being done by white ministers who have formed thriving settlements up the country (where the land is fertile and the climate healthy), and have urged upon the natives the importance of cultivating rice, corn, potatoes, ginger, sugar, coffee, and arrowroot, all of which are remunerative crops. As for cotton, indigo, pepper, pineapples, and gumtrees, they grow wild, and the superior knowledge of the missionaries has enabled the natives to gather them profitably. But Christian workers have to reckon with a foe more stubborn than Paganism. Islam is gradually winning its way towards the West Coast from the interior. The sword, it is true, goes hand in hand with the green banner, but the African negro is a ready convert. He finds the precepts of the Prophet easy to understand, and the sanction of polygamy is in entire accord with his present practice. Moreover, where Mahomet gains ground, intemperance—which unhappily follows Christian missions—disappears. I have said that Liberia is fertile. It is certainly the richest district in West Africa, but it is terribly neglected, and can never thrive under its present administration. There is practically no Government. The rule of the negro is marked by selfishness and corruption. The colonisation societies in the United States have almost abandoned in despair sending out more emigrants who, on landing, finding themselves free from control, quickly become lazy and wholly useless as pioneers for opening up fresh country. It must be confessed, therefore, that, after a trial of seventy years, the American negroes have failed to erect a State worthy of the name. They have lost what little credit they had twenty years ago—not even the interest is paid on the loan of 500,000 dols. raised in London in 1870—and Liberia is gradually drifting into the hands of a few wide-awake German merchants, who are understood to have made advances to Government against valuable securities, as well as to have exerted sufficient influence in Berlin to induce General Caprivi to protest in vigorous language against the concession known as the ""indiarubber monopoly,"" granted by President Johnson to an English syndicate of company promoters under circumstances which have been severely criticised. Lord Salisbury was aware of the facts, but it yet remains to be seen whether the British Government will raise its voice against a German protectorate of Liberia.—""E.

We ventured to observe, some time since, when treating of the obstacles to rapid progress in Liberia, that it might be ""worth while for the Liberians resolutely to set themselves about the inquiry as to how far their laws and regulations with regard to foreigners and to the tenure of land may be chargeable with the great evil of impeding the introduction of that which is the sinew of agriculture as well as of war—i.e., capital.""\n\nWe cannot but express our deep regret, presuming the Liberian Herald to be the true exponent of Liberian feeling, at the state of feeling in Liberia on this question.

No foreigner can possess land or houses in Liberia. Consequently, no foreigner can hold land or houses in Liberia as a security for capital advanced.

We have read it attentively, but we cannot find in it that dependable rectification of errors in King Weah’s statement, published by us last month, which we had looked for. Having received constant and minute intelligence from Cape Palmas, from the period of the advent of the Liberian Commissioner there, we discover that there are important omissions in the Report; nor are we at all satisfied that King Weah’s statements are incorrect as regards either of the two great points—viz., the commencement of warlike operations and the territorial claims. We are surprised at the failure of the Report on these points, because, if there be one thing more than another in which the public men in Liberia have excelled, it has been in the drawing up of their Reports, Presidential Messages, and other State documents; and still more surprised, because many portions of the Report are written with a most charming air of sincerity and good feeling, becoming the character and position of the Commissioner. The Commissioner states that there was a warlike demonstration of the natives on the 10th of August, and that on the following day some of them began deliberately to fire on the Hoffman Mission Station. He then adds: “Thus war began, as far as I know the facts.” As the Commissioner was at Cape Palmas at that time, he must have had a personal knowledge of the facts had they been such as he relates; and the impression produced on our mind is that, not himself believing the statement to be altogether true, he was too conscientious to vouch for it. Then as regards the Land question. The Special Commissioner states that the object of the combination among the natives is “the re-possession of the territory,” which involves rights and powers that would be incompatible with the fiscal arrangements of the Liberian Government; that the natives “deny that the Liberian Government has acquired the domain; that they declare themselves the masters; that they ignore the deed of purchase by the Maryland Colonization Society, and assert that the articles therein mentioned were paid to them for landing the immigrants and building their huts.” Looking to probabilities, we cannot believe that the natives sold the entire lands of their country, and their own right of free action, but only the lands on which they permitted the immigrants of the Colonization Society to settle, assisting them in landing, building their huts, &c. We must frankly state, however, that we do not attach much importance to this. Liberia has become an organized and recognized State, with institutions framed and established on the model of the United States of America.

Hence we are living here not in harmony and love; every man is opposed to the progress of his neighbour in whatever pursuit he follows; whether it be in the mercantile line or farming, it seems as a dagger driven into us to see any one else prosper; very few sympathise with their fellow-citizen when misfortune happens to him, and fewer still will give any aid except for a large reward. Even the immigrants who are invited by us from America to come and help us to build up this black nationality, when they come out, except they possess a little money, are looked down upon with disdain and contempt by the other citizens; any advantages that can be taken of them will be taken. Sometimes we may be paid by the merchants when we are in their employment in Liberian currency, and if without leaving the store we give them back the currency for the purchase of some article in their store, they refuse to take the very currency they paid us, demanding specie of us; and if they do take it, it will be at a discount; and when foreigners come here to reside among us to do business, whether they be our colour or white men, whereby we can get articles cheaper, be employed, and the country built up for our benefit, the majority of people are against them, and they will try everything in their power to entrap them in law-suits; they will go to their places of business, abuse, insult, curse and swear at them, and some of our young men, when in the employment of foreigners, will skulk away a part of their time in idleness; and if their employers bring them up for it they will question their authority in doing so, and begin to speak of their freedom, and demand full pay for the time they have wasted in idleness; and if the foreigners refuse to pay them they are taken to law and made to pay, for our laws, Mr. Editor, are all one-sided. No foreigners or new-comers expect to get justice in Liberia; if they do, they will certainly drain the pockets well first. Whether this is done from the ignorance of the people, or whether they are influenced by the few merchants here, I cannot say; one thing I know, that this is a practice in the Republic, to take all advantage they can of foreigners, that they may be discouraged and leave the country. I am a supporter of foreigners, for without foreigners we cannot live. America receives into her country immigrants of all nations. The Dutchman finds a home and welcome; he brings with him skill and science, and puts them in operation. The Frenchman, the Englishman, the German, and Italian find welcome hands beckoning them to come; therefore America has advanced to what she is this day. Why can\'t Liberia stretch out her hands to all nations, and invite them into her country? Why can\'t Liberia open her ""Constitution,"" and allow all nations to come in and build her up? Why do Liberians take advantage of foreigners and strangers, and combine together against them? These are the things that keep us from progressing. Since our Government was a Government it has been in an embarrassed state; never was Liberia able to redeem her currency in gold and silver, as she reports. These things can be easily remedied if better steps were to be taken, and selfishness and self-conceit put away.', 'last_edit_date': '1869-05-08', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1869#article-29', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LANDS IN LIBERIA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'may help to develop the great natural resources of their rich and extensive territories.

Antony Atmore and Shula Marks$^{28}$ in particular have sum› marized succinctly the current interpretations and have gone on to offer some new ideas which, in turn, have generated further research. 29 Atmore and Marks argue that the scholars who have relied most heavily on 'the official record' such as R. Robinson and J. Gallagher, broadly recognize the importance of economic factors in explaining late nineteenthcentury British imperialism, 'but veer sharply away from any further and more precise economic analysis of the events they portray, whether in South Africa or elsewhere.' Instead, the 'official mind' historians see British expansion, in the final analysis, as occurring when policy-makers are drawn irresistibly into the African (including the South African) interior to stop 'crises or emergencies' on the 'frontier' or 'periphery' of their formal colonial holdings or informal empire. However, what is omitted, Atmore and Marks point out, is the thorough analysis of these crises, which in the end proved so crucial for the creation of the British empire. In fact, when these crises are explored, they reveal that they were actually 'related to the break-down of indigenous authorities under the weight of the demands of an increasingly industrialized Britain.' In the early nineteenth century these pressures occurred mostly on the eastern front in South Africa, where the informal agents of industrialized Britain - the missionaries, traders, and administrators - were active. But with mineral discoveries in the interior in the late nineteenth century, the demands of industrialized Britain rapidly shifted there and were imposed upon both the African states and the Boer republics. Thus, although the strategic importance of the Cape on the sea route to India continued to influence British imperial policy in South Africa in the late nineteenth century, expanding British economic interests in the subcontinent weighed preponderantly."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'Conquest and reaction in British West Africa, 1880-1900 > Asante (Gold Coast)', 'content': ""Why did the Asante decide not to fight the British on this occasion?

The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British, Boers and Africans in South Africa, 1850-80', 'section_title': 'British expansion in South Africa 1870-80', 'content': 'Between 1871 and 1874, however, the British government tried to secure a federation of the South African states and thereby to guarantee the security of its interests in South Africa by means of persuasion.

African resistance varied in accordance with the nature of the society and in accordance with how each community perceived the external threat to its sovereignty. '$^{s}$ What differed was the extent or otherwise of resistance. As Ochieng puts it, 'practically everywhere in Kenya the imposition of colonial rule was resisted. Better armed and employing groups of mercenaries, the British imposed their authority only by violence'. 16 On the coast, the Mazrui family resisted the take-over by the IBEAC. This resistance was led by Mbaruk bin Rashid who organized hit-and-run warfare against the superior weapons of the British forces. It took reinforce› ments of Indian troops brought in by the British to defeat him. He fled Tanganyika, only to fall into the hands of the Germans. The Mazrui resistance came about as a result of British attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the coastal societies. After the Mazrui family had settled in Takarungu on the Kenya coast, they had gradually begun to extend their influence to many parts of the coast. They acquired, for example, the monopoly of buying grain from the Mijikenda people along the coast and had thus come to control the sale of food crops on the coast. The monopoly was resisted by the Giriama between 1877 and 1883 when war broke out between the two groups. The Mazrui were defeated. There› after, they had come to some understanding with the Giriama whereupon the two communities became trading partners. The coming of the British interfered with this arrangement as well as the internal organization of the Mazrui society, providing one reason why the Mazrui resisted the imposition of British rule.\nWhen in 1895, the Wali Takarungu died, the IBEAC chose their local friend to succeed him instead of Mbaruk who had a better claim to the throne but was known not to favour the British presence.$^{17}$ It was for this reason that Mbaruk sought to drive the British away from the coast by force."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Marketing', 'content': ""Certainly, until the early 1930s, the tendency was to encourage whoever was likely to contribute in this respect.

The 'dislike and distrust of the Levantine communities' in West Africa, which Professor Bauer noticed to be 'marked in official circles', 71 was a relatively recent development. Real hostility towards the Levantines, mostly Lebanese, came not from official circles but from the various European agents of commercial firms, and such hostility was in response to effective trade rivalry presented by the Levantines.$^{72}$ And where British firms appear to have been given preference, it was not because of their respectability, but because they could - with the blessing of the British government - act as effective pressure groups and influence colonial policy› makers. 73 Still, Ehrlich's generalization that 'administrative attitudes, throughout British Africa, rarely encouraged indigenous commercial initiative'$^{74}$ is quite valid. But other factors stifled local initiatives. First of all, general official policy, as would be expected in a colonial situation, was geared primarily towards the advancement of imperialist interests. Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction. By the first decade of the twentieth century, following the construction of railways, European firms were squeezing African traders in two related ways. Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

To maintain this naval supremacy, Germany's African communications system and principal ports had to be put out of action. For the Allies, successful campaigns in Germany's colonial possessions might result in their being shared by the victors as spoils of war. This was certainly a major consideration in the decision of the Commandant-General of the South African forces, General Louis Botha, and the Minister of Defence, J. C.

The Nandi in Kenya, for instance, resisted militarily the construc› tion of the railway through their territory. Of all the peoples of Kenya, they put up the strongest and longest military resistance to British im› perialism; it began in the 1890s and did not end until their leader was murdered by the British commanders in 1905, on his way to the negotiations which had been treacherously arranged. That event weakened Nandi resistance and eventually led to the British occupation of their territory.\nThat the Nandi resisted the British for over seven years was due to the nature of their society. Nandi society was divided into territorial units called pororiet. Warriors from each unit were responsible for the defence of the territory. For this reason, the warriors slept in a common hut. This was the nearest thing to a standing army. These territorial armies came together under the leadership of an orgoiyot, or traditional leader. It was he who decided when the army would go on a raid. The armies were linked to him through a personal representative who sat at each territorial council. Because territory rather than clan was the centre of Nandi social life, this meant that clan rivalry was absent. The result was a cohesive society, and it was this cohesion that gave the society military superiority over its neighbours. Maison writes that 'It is surprising that so small a tribe as the Nandi was able to terrorize much larger peoples and to continue to do so almost with impunity for several decades.' 11 Given the social cohesion of the society as well as the confidence of the warriors both in themselves and in their leaders, it is not surprising that they became a military power to reckon with. Their military successes led them to believe that they were superior to other people, white men included. As G. W. B. Huntingford noted, 'The Nandi thinks himself at least the equal, if not the superior of the whiteman; and any estimate of the changes brought about by the impact of our civilization must be considered in the light of this fact'.$^{12}$ The Nandi successfully resisted this occupation for over seven years, then, because of the success with which the society had been knit together as a fighting force."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 325, 'article_title': 'SIERRA LEONE, LIBERIA, AND BRITISH POLICY ON THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA.', 'full_section_title': 'SIERRA LEONE, LIBERIA, AND BRITISH POLICY ON THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1864#article-13', 'issue_date': '23_02_1864', 'content': ""But in praising Her Majesty's Government for having rejected the Liberian claims, and refused Liberia a territory and coast that do not belong to her, and of which she could make no good use for African civilization, we have only treated one half of the question. The other and more important one remains, What is to be done with those territories? They cannot, must not, remain as they are. Turner's Peninsula, extending from the Shebar to the Gallinas River, was ceded to the English in 1825-6, and although the acceptance of that cession was not confirmed by the Crown, the same desire of British protection and rule which then dictated it still exists. A renewal of the cession might be again immediately obtained. We say most emphatically that the Government of Sierra Leone ought to be empowered by the Crown to obtain such renewal, with a view to its immediate acceptance at home. Our view as to the British occupation at any point of the West Coast is, that its object is to put down the slave-trade and promote the civilization of that portion of Africa. Everything that can be done ought, therefore, to be done to enable Sierra Leone to fulfil her assigned mission as a British colony. She ought to have exercised civilising influence over all the territories between herself and the Gambia, &c.; the Pongas, the Rio Nunez, and the whole of that rich territory, should have been hers. These, thanks to the inconceivable policy of successive Governments at home, have escaped us. The French have spent too much blood and treasure there in recent expeditions, to bring them effectively under her subjection, to allow of any hope of her giving them up. But it would be madness on the part of the Government to promise the same course as regards the Sherbro and Gallinas and adjacent territories. They are the natural appanage of Sierra Leone, provided they can be brought to place themselves under supreme British authority, which we believe they would readily do. It is only thus that the petty slave-trade still carried on from them to the Portuguese possessions northward can be put an end to. With British protection there, the energies of British merchants would soon be directed to these territories, proverbially rich in native productions. And we cannot conceive the policy which neglects to order, and which discourages such annexations. We could perfectly comprehend that there might be considerable hesitation felt, and considerable opposition shown to the forming of some entirely new colony on the Coast, where England does not at present sway or protect.

From want of energy France has been allowed to take the upper waters under its protection; and the result is that the Gambia colony has to be described as small and retrograding.

That treaty was intended to form the last link of a chain of agreements which should simplify the relations of the two Powers in that part of Africa, and it is now too late to urge the extension of our political influence into a sphere which has been assigned to France. It is impossible, in territories where the frontier is still vague, for one civilised Government to refuse to acknowledge treaties submitted to it by another on the ground that native signatories of the treaty desire to repudiate it. If such a principle were admitted the only result would be a speedy return to the primitive reign of force. Peaceful agreements with native chiefs would have no meaning, and the civilisation of barbarous countries must be preceded by military occupation. Nor should it be forgotten that if the present position of France in relation to English settlements upon the West Coast of Africa is displeasing to English merchants, they have themselves to thank for the fact that any French settlements now exist.\n3\n\n...ween the River Pongas and the Gaboon.

The British protectorate, as you are aware, is extended over a large portion of the Coast of Africa, which stretches from the settlement of Sierra Leone to the district of the Niger. Upon this coast, excluding the State of Liberia and the neighbourhood of Whydah, the port of Dahomey, there are three French settlements—viz., Grand Bassam, Assinie, and Porto Novo; also portions of coast unprotected by any European Power. West of Grand Bassam there is unoccupied coast of considerable extent; east of Lagos, beyond Leckie, and reaching to Old Calabar, there is the important territory at the mouths of the Niger. Quite recently the Germans have taken certain ports on this coast—viz., Ahgweh, Bageida, and Little Popo. At these there was a thriving and increasing British trade, and with the chiefs of Ahgweh and Little Popo treaties had been made on behalf of Her Majesty, securing the right of British subjects to trade on equal terms with those of any other nation. The occupation by France and the late annexations by Germany break the continuity of the British protectorate; there is an increasing conflict of the various national interests, and the influence of the British authorities with the natives is being lessened; the introduction of different principles of trading will also seriously affect the prosperity of British commerce. It is important to mention in this connexion that the duties upon spirits, arms, and ammunition levied in the British settlements furnish the greater portion of the Government revenue. In German and French settlements these articles are known, in most cases, to be free of duty, and being sold to a great extent in the same markets as the British imports, competition becomes difficult, and the loss to the British revenue and trade must ultimately be great. The Chamber would suggest, therefore, that while negotiations regarding African territories are pending, something might be done in the way of exchange or by mutual concession to induce Germany, at least, to withdraw from those newly acquired ports where British trade had become established, and where German rivalry upon different principles is likely to be so injurious. This Government might also be requested to take into consideration the question of the extension of the British protectorate to the unprotected portion of the coast named.—I am, &c.,\n\n""C. B.

As my time is limited, I pass at once to the Sierra Leone question. It is well to remember that many of the things which we read about Africa and Sierra Leone are not true. Now in Sierra Leone a remarkable portion of the African race is strongly represented. I am not ashamed to admit that I belong to that race—a race liberated by your philanthropy, and many of whom returned to their native shores. When these depreciatory opinions are spread amongst people to whom we are so much indebted, we think the time has come to declare that the statements are untrue. The Yoruba people, from whom a large number of the inhabitants of Sierra Leone spring, are very much like the English in their aptness for trade, and they are intelligent and industrious. Hence the Sierra Leone people have forced their way to the forefront almost everywhere on the West Coast. Mr. Johnston says that Sierra Leone has failed. It is now 102 years old. Up to about twenty years ago the whole extent of Sierra Leone was only 18 miles by 16. What great things do you expect from such a strip of country? Mr. Johnston has done great service by pointing out that you want more territory. What has happened? When the native chiefs offered more territory—they were refused. The French then stepped in, and little by little took this territory. It seems to me that in this they showed greater statesmanship than our Colonial Governors. Now—20 years after—the British Government would be only too glad to obtain this territory; and we are told that the Gambia has been offered in exchange for what had been refused through your Colonial Governors. About ten or twelve years ago the trade of Sierra Leone with Great Britain amounted to £500,000 per annum, but since then this has been reduced to £190,000. This shows the importance of seizing every legitimate opportunity of extending your influence in these parts. At the back of us are Bouré, Sangara, Falaba, and other places, from which a considerable trade to Sierra Leone flowed. I fear that unless some action is taken by the British Government that territory will fall into the hands of the French. The feeling of loyalty to this country, which pervades the mind of every negro in Sierra Leone, would be destroying by their having to clear out of the Colony and having to betake themselves to Liberia.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-03-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_03_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The present is a very critical time in the history of the British West African Colonies.

Rather more than two years ago, an agreement was concluded at Paris between our Government and that of France with regard to the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence in West Africa. The territories referred to in the agreement were Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast. It was provided that the two Governments should have the right of appointing special Commissions of Delimitation ""to trace upon the spot, wherever they may consider it necessary, the line of demarcation between the English and French possessions"" in conformity with the agreement. The work of determining the boundary line between Senegambia and Sierra Leone is now about to be begun, the British Commissioners having left Liverpool on Saturday last. For some time past British merchants interested in commerce with Sierra Leone have been apprehensive that their trade with the interior might be seriously interfered with, if not absolutely ruined, by a wrongful definition of the boundary.

On the east we are similarly threatened by the Germans. They started with the possession of a small station at Beh, the people of which had long been desirous of entering the protectorate, but their offers were refused by the Government. This year a Commissioner was appointed to define the frontier. A line was decided on extending due north from the coast for a distance of over three miles into the interior. On this decision the Germans immediately annexed the Krepe country as far as the banks of the Volta. The Krepes were formerly in the Danish protectorate when we acquired Quittah and all the Danish possessions. Krepe went with the rest, yet we have allowed the Germans to annex the place. The sympathies of the natives are solely with the British. These German annexations are made by the advice and on the surveys of the Basle missionaries, who have for years been subsidised and protected by the British Government. For the rescue of some of their mission the Ashantee war was undertaken. The importance of these annexations will be seen when one has a knowledge of the trade routes to the interior, as it is upon the trade with the interior that the colony depends. There are three routes. The western is up the Tando River. A very large trade is carried on here, Ashanti being mainly supplied by this route. The command of the River Tando is lost if we permit the French to dispossess us of part of Apollonia and Aowin. The central route is via Cape Coast to Prahsu and Coomassie. A small trade is done here, owing to all the carriage being by land. This route is in British hands so far. The eastern, which will be the more important route, as by it most of the Mussulman trade is carried on, passes by the Volta through Krepe. Unless the Germans are dispossessed of this country, no British trade will be done this way. I hope you will call the attention of your Society to the neglect of British interests by the Government, and to the need for instant action, or else the whole of the British trade in these parts will fall into the hands of other European Powers.

Sierra Leone, however, has not much to show for its century of British rule. Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession.

Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best.

This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.\nIn the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium. Major Christian missionary bodies such as the Church Missionary Society (CMS) of the Church of England and the Lyons-based SociØtØ des Missions Africaines (SMA) of the Roman Catholic Church each employed a mix of European nationals. Father Boghero, who led the SMA in an effort to re› introduce Roman Catholic Christianity to West Africa in the nineteenth century, was an Italian. The pioneer SMA Fathers in most parts of the area which became Nigeria were French, just as it was such British missionaries as Thomas Birch Freeman of the Methodists and Samuel Ajayi Crowther of the CMS who pioneered the work of Christian missions in what was to become French Dahomey (present-day People's Republic of Benin).$^{33}$ British, French, German and Portuguese traders set up businesses adjacent to one another and, as the case of Badagry clearly demonstrated, there were residential quarters for diverse European nationals in the major ports all along the coast of the Bight of Benin.\nTraders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.712, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The legacy of wars', 'content': 'In other words, while European powers were dealing with individual African states, recognizing them, befriending some and fighting others in Africa, in Europe they closed ranks along racial lines and formed a cartel to regulate the flow of essential arms to the Africans.

The competition for power in Africa had been drawn into the international politics of the Concert of Europe where African diplomatic skills were at a grave disadvantage. It is doubtful whether African leaders realized until too late how great was the danger that threatened them. They were used to thinking that the European base was far away and that, in the final analysis, they had the advantage of numbers.\nThey continued to act as if they could play off one European power against another. In South Africa, they even believed that they could appeal to the Queen of England and her direct representatives to carry out treaty obligations against the wishes of Anglo-Boer settlers and fortune seekers. Far from any notion of forging a pan-African solidarity similar to that pursued by the Europeans, each African state acted as seemed best in its own individual interest.\nIt appears that, if any factor is to be singled out, the basic explanation for this was to be found not only in the diplomatic abilities of the European strategists, but also in the legacy of wars that was part of the revolutionary situation of nineteenth-century Africa.

Similarly, British peace› makers involved in resolving aspects of nineteenth-century Yoruba warfare had to travel virtually throughout the length and breadth of the culture area.\nUnfortunately, the European approach was divisive, tending towards politically structured differentiation. This was already noticeable in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era. British interests came to be specifically protected visà-vis the interest of other European nationals; British interests were also advanced against those of Africans. We have already drawn attention to the penetration of the Benin kingdom from the Niger delta and the resultant whittling down of Benin's trading hinterland to the extent of the eventual abandonment of Ughoton, Benin's traditional port.

M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

Moreover, in addition to enjoying peace at home, however divided the European powers were on imperial and colonial issues, throughout the era of partition and up to 1914 they always managed to resolve these questions without resort to war. Thus, in spite of the intense competition and the numerous crises in Africa, the European powers involved in the partition displayed a remarkable spirit of solidarity which not only elimi› nated wars among them but also prevented the African rulers and com› munities from effectively playing one European power against the other. Throughout the period under review, various European powers took on the African states one at a time, and on no occasion was an African state assisted by one European power against another.\nBy contrast, the behaviour of the African states was not only marked by lack of solidarity, unity or co-operation but some of them did not hesitate to ally with the invading European forces against their neighbours, only to be vanquished later themselves. The Baganda allied with the British against the Banyoro, and the Barotse with the British against the Ndebele, while the Bambara teamed up with the French against the Tukulor.$^{59}$ As a result of all this, the heroic and memorable stands which the Africans took against the European invaders were - as will be seen in subsequent chapters$^{60}$ - more often than not, isolated forms of uncoordinated resist› ance, even at the regional level."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The changing balance of power', 'content': ""Similarly, most African leaders were very suspicious of European missionaries. Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains.

In Mozambique their effective control was by 1800 limited to Mozambique Island; elsewhere they depended more on Brazilian and mulatto merchants than on Portuguese officials.

This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories.

There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection.

Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures.

Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size.

In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones.

In June last Samori, who is Sultan of the southern States lying between the upper waters of the Niger and the frontiers of Sierra Leone and Guinea, was obliged to fly before the French, and took refuge in the more remote parts of his own territory. Lieut. Marchand, who headed an expedition to the next State of Tieba, lying due east towards the interior, has, according to the report, received there a deputation from the still more central State of Mossi offering friendship to the whites. There is some confusion in the account, for it states that the chief, Mossi, charged his envoys to declare that the road to Sikasso, through the Mossi territory, is open to the French. Sikasso is in Tieba's territory, some 200 miles or so nearer to the coast than Mossi's country, and it was at Sikasso that Lieut. Marchand should have received the deputation. Captain Monteil, who commanded one of the many expeditions which left the West Coast in the spring, is, however, reported to be at Onagadongon, in Mossi's territory, and if this is the case, the message may refer to freedom of passage for him to return through Sikasso towards the coast.\n\nBoundoukou, where the carriers are said to have abandoned Captain Menard, is on the borders of Ashantee and Anno, but if the party which Colonel Archinard has sent southward by Pong to meet and relieve him effect their object, a penetration due north parallel to that attempted in vain by the unfortunate Quiqurey expedition will have been achieved. The States of Mossi and Gourma, which Captain Monteil is said also to have crossed, touch with the State of Gando, and falls into the Niger territory. In penetrating to them the French have therefore visited the whole of their territory that lies within the 10th and 15th parallel of latitude. Unfortunately for the prospects of permanent advantage to result from the exploration, the fight with Samori is not yet over. The French troops are reported as concentrated at Uofana for the purpose of driving him from Kankan, and until Samori has given his submission the submission of minor chiefs counts for little.

In 1879, however, a comprehensive scheme for the development of the French power in Senegambia, for the building of forts and the construction of railways, was laid before the Chamber of Deputies, and partially adopted; and in the years 1880-83 a line of stations was carried from the Senegal to the Upper Niger, reaching the latter river in 12½ deg. north latitude. Elsewhere, but as part of the same policy—a policy of making the whole of the Western Soudan a great dependency of France—equal energy was displayed. If the reader will refer to any map of Africa of fair scale he will find a place marked Assinee on the coast, not very far removed from Cape Coast Castle. Assinee was formerly an old French dependency, and this dependency, in pursuance of the same policy, was revived, and its boundary extended until the whole shore line between the British Gold Coast Colony on the east and the Republic of Liberia on the west has now been secured by France. Further to the east again, Porto Novo and other stations, on what was once the Slave Coast, are in the occupation of the French, and from them they have carried their arms into the Kingdom of Dahomey. Even on the Lower Niger the French established themselves, and only the conjunction of forces represented by the National African Company led to their traders withdrawing, and to the relinquishing of territorial claims in that neighbourhood.\n\nIt was not till 1884 that the career of Germany in Africa began. In July of that year she set up her flag at Togo, at the eastern end of the Gold Coast, and at the Cameroons, hard by the Oil Rivers and Niger Delta. She has added considerably to her African possessions since, and so spirited became her policy that had it not been for the resource of Mr. Cecil Rhodes she would have ere this absorbed the magnificent land which everybody is now content to know by the name of the man who preserved it for this country. Since 1874 the British Government has been continuously occupied with boundary questions; but the Conference held at Berlin in 1885, and the famous Anglo-German Agreement of 1890 relating to Africa and Heligoland (which re-stated and revised the boundary between the two Powers in the Niger regions, and also marked a line between the German Protectorate of Togo, and the British Gold Coast colony), have helped materially in the simplification of those knotty points which have inevitably arisen from time to time.

Livingstone and Stanley had been busily occupied filling up the map. The secret of the source of the Niger had long been known, and the river itself had been left, in the main, to numerous private traders, who had competed keenly one with another. In 1879 the whole of the English firms doing business on the river coalesced and formed one large company, under the name of the United or National African Company. This combination was a part, and no small part, of the new European movement in Africa. It was formed to combat foreign competition, which had been growing at a rate that augured badly for British interests if resources and efforts remained divided. In this connexion, and in illustration of the view that Africa is being at last treated as a continent, as a theatre of empire and a means of national aggrandisement, Mr. Lucas notes what European peoples were once strong in Africa, and who are they that now prevail.\n\n""The Portuguese,"" he says, ""are still there, but with only a shadow of their former strength; the English are there; the French are there. One European Power, the Dutch, for many years the strongest of all, has now no place at all in Africa, though the Dutch race is perpetuated in the south, under English or Republican Government. On the other hand, the Germans, who, except for the few years when the Brandenburghers traded on the Guinea Coast, never had any footing in Africa, have lately taken a prominent position among the Europeans who are in so lordly a manner slicing up the continent. The Dutch were, above all others, a trading and carrying people. They went to Africa—at any rate, to West Africa—as carriers, and when the carrying trade over the Atlantic came to an end their connexions with West Africa gradually died away. Weak as Holland is when compared with Great Britain, or France, or Germany, she still holds her East Indian and West Indian possessions; but since West Africa has ceased to be what she once was, the scene of a series of depôts from which ships fetched human wares, she has left the Guinea Coast apparently for ever. Meanwhile, a new Power—Germany—has made its appearance. The Germans, no doubt, like all other peoples, look in their colonial enterprises to securing trade for the mother country; but they have taken their place in Africa under, and in full harmony with, the new set of conditions. They have come there as a continental people to a continent, not as a sea-going merchant people to a coast. They have come, not like the Prussians of old, to build and hold on sufferance small factories, but to rule, or claim to rule, to protect, or claim to protect, large areas of territory.

Rather more than two years ago, an agreement was concluded at Paris between our Government and that of France with regard to the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence in West Africa. The territories referred to in the agreement were Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast. It was provided that the two Governments should have the right of appointing special Commissions of Delimitation ""to trace upon the spot, wherever they may consider it necessary, the line of demarcation between the English and French possessions"" in conformity with the agreement. The work of determining the boundary line between Senegambia and Sierra Leone is now about to be begun, the British Commissioners having left Liverpool on Saturday last. For some time past British merchants interested in commerce with Sierra Leone have been apprehensive that their trade with the interior might be seriously interfered with, if not absolutely ruined, by a wrongful definition of the boundary.

It has witnessed the definite transference of the entire tract from the dominion of savage and barbarous tribes to the hands of various European Powers—notably, France, Germany, and England. Whilst all of these, and particularly England, have had commercial relations with the West Coast for many years, it has only been during the last couple of decades that the territory has been portioned out, and European ascendency over the Native races made itself felt finally and irremovably. No more concise or accurate summary of the march of events in this portion of the African continent is probably to be found anywhere than that contained in Vol. III. of Mr. C. B. Lucas\'s ""Historical Geography of the British Colonies"" (Frowde).\n\nIn discussing the influences which have combined to render possible that fairly precise delimitation of frontiers in West Africa which any ordinary map of the continent now displays, Mr. Lucas points out that nations take to colonial enterprise for the most opposite reasons—sometimes in consequence of a great failure, sometimes in consequence of a great success. Thus, for example, when this country lost its American colonies, our people found compensation in colonising Australia, and when the French were defeated by the Germans in the war of 1870, and were deprived of their provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, they appear to have concentrated their energies in an endeavour to extend the boundaries of their colonial empire. On the other hand, as soon as Portugal had taken its present form and shape, as soon as it became a country and a nation, Portuguese enterprise began to overflow into Africa. The great Spanish empire in America was founded on the heels of the consolidation of Spain by the union of Arragon and Castile. For the Germans the result of the war of 1870 was to consolidate the German nation, and when it ended they wanted new openings. These they found outside Europe—in the Pacific and in Africa.

The British protectorate, as you are aware, is extended over a large portion of the Coast of Africa, which stretches from the settlement of Sierra Leone to the district of the Niger. Upon this coast, excluding the State of Liberia and the neighbourhood of Whydah, the port of Dahomey, there are three French settlements—viz., Grand Bassam, Assinie, and Porto Novo; also portions of coast unprotected by any European Power. West of Grand Bassam there is unoccupied coast of considerable extent; east of Lagos, beyond Leckie, and reaching to Old Calabar, there is the important territory at the mouths of the Niger. Quite recently the Germans have taken certain ports on this coast—viz., Ahgweh, Bageida, and Little Popo. At these there was a thriving and increasing British trade, and with the chiefs of Ahgweh and Little Popo treaties had been made on behalf of Her Majesty, securing the right of British subjects to trade on equal terms with those of any other nation. The occupation by France and the late annexations by Germany break the continuity of the British protectorate; there is an increasing conflict of the various national interests, and the influence of the British authorities with the natives is being lessened; the introduction of different principles of trading will also seriously affect the prosperity of British commerce. It is important to mention in this connexion that the duties upon spirits, arms, and ammunition levied in the British settlements furnish the greater portion of the Government revenue. In German and French settlements these articles are known, in most cases, to be free of duty, and being sold to a great extent in the same markets as the British imports, competition becomes difficult, and the loss to the British revenue and trade must ultimately be great. The Chamber would suggest, therefore, that while negotiations regarding African territories are pending, something might be done in the way of exchange or by mutual concession to induce Germany, at least, to withdraw from those newly acquired ports where British trade had become established, and where German rivalry upon different principles is likely to be so injurious. This Government might also be requested to take into consideration the question of the extension of the British protectorate to the unprotected portion of the coast named.—I am, &c.,\n\n""C. B.

For some months now the trade of Lagos has been blocked by the closing of the roads which, running through the district inhabited by the Jebu and Egba tribes, connect that port with the interior; but we are pleased to learn, from the latest telegrams received, that the careful and earnest steps that are being taken by the authorities to secure the opening of these trade routes, have not been without their moral effect upon the tribes implicated, for they are already making overtures of peace and reconciliation. It is much to be hoped that this is the case, for at the present time trade needs fostering on the West Coast more than perhaps ever before, and this object can only be attained by the cheerful co-operation of all interested in its maintenance. The British administration in West Africa has been by no means free from faults in the past; and these faults have born their natural fruit.

Bonny, Brass, and Old Calabar are among the oldest of these trading ports, the native chiefs being also the native traders. They possessed numerous slaves who were sent with merchandise to the interior markets to collect oil, which was brought to the stations and sold to the whites.

Of his enemies the most powerful was Oko Jumbo, who lost no opportunity to humiliate him. The Europeans could only let matters take their course; they regretted constant fighting of Oko Jumbo and Ja Ja, but the relations between the Europeans and natives being strictly commercial, nothing could be done. Suffering reverses, Ja Ja was forced to fly with the remnant of his people after great slaughter at the hands of Oko Jumbo.

All these trading establishments are constructed mainly of corrugated iron, with iron framework, though the interior may be lined with timber. The houses are well built, well ventilated, and comfortably furnished, and have all the appearance of a bright, pleasant home. With every trading colony of any size—that is to say, where there are more than three or four trading houses—there is a medical officer, jointly paid by the various firms.\n\nPerhaps in no body of Englishmen abroad has such an improvement taken place as in the class of men who now conduct the trade with the natives in West Africa. In former times we had the unscrupulous scoundrels and pirates who carried on the slave trade between West Africa and America. To them succeeded the scarcely more polished ""palm oil ruffians""—the masters and crews of the sailing vessels which would anchor for about a year in some one of the Oil Rivers, fill up their ships with native produce, and then sail away again. The conduct of the masters and seamen of these trading vessels was often outrageous. The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment. With the missionaries it can be imagined how these ruffians came in conflict; and so angry were they at the prospect of the missionaries protecting their victims, or interfering with them, that they bribed and frightened the native chiefs, and used every effort to prevent the missionaries obtaining any hold on the country. The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa. Yearly the improvement continues; more and more the great trading companies of Liverpool and Bristol have realised that their interests are better served by men of good manners and refinement.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

It is now announced that the British Government will recommend Parliament to grant a subsidy to a contractor who is prepared to lay and work a cable between St. Vincent and the chief places on the West Coast. We are sure our readers will rejoice at this further step towards bringing West Africa into closer connexion with England. At present, the three weeks taken by even the fastest postal communication is a serious drawback to the commerce of Lagos, Sierra Leone, and the other West African ports, and the proposed cable will do much to simplify and develop commercial relations between Great Britain and the ports and towns in her West Coast possessions. Further south, we have the still more important district of the Congo. Mr. H. M. Stanley, than whom no greater authority upon the subject exists, seems never to tire of pointing out the advantages which must result from the formation of new markets in the Congo territory; and the decision of the European Powers at the Berlin Conference that Free Trade principles should be established at least for a term of years in the territory of the African International Association will do much towards the development of trade with parts not hitherto reached by commerce. The British Congo Company (Limited), the prospectus of which our readers will find in another column, which may be aptly described as the practical outcome of the Conference's decision, is now announced, with a capital of £500,000, divided into shares of £5 each. The Board of Directors contains many names well known in the African trade. Even under no very favourable circumstances a considerable trade has been for the past few years conducted between this country and the Congo. Last year, the imports into this district amounted to considerably over £880,000, and the exports to nearly £2,000,000—so that in round numbers the present trade may be roughly estimated at between two and a-half and three million pounds per annum. Though only just formed, the British Congo Company (Limited) will scarcely commence as an entirely new undertaking, for, in order to avoid the delays and disadvantages inseparable from an entirely new business, a provisional agreement has been made with the Congo and Central African Company (Limited), of Liverpool, which possesses several factories and stations along the river, and at Ambriz and Ambrizette on the coast, by which the Congo and Central African Company agrees to transfer its stations, factories, and buildings, stores and plant, its steamers, cargo, surf and other boats, to this Company at a valuation, to be paid for by fully paid-up shares in this Company, and to sell its stock of goods, merchandise, and produce to this Company at cost price. No payment will be made for goodwill, the shareholders in that Company being satisfied that they will make a larger profit by becoming interested in a more powerfully-constituted undertaking. This agreement will provide the new Company at once with a favourable basis for its operations, and enable it to enter immediately upon a profitable business in the Lower Congo district, and give great facilities for opening up trade as communications with the Upper Congo are established. Thus we are assured of a speedy increase of an already existing trade in the districts placed under the International African Association, and the British Congo Company (Limited), by possessing stations upon the coast as well as along the course of the river, will be well prepared to participate in the trade which is constantly developing among the peoples in the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In all the coast region between the Gambia and the Cameroons the most extravagant development of tropical vegetation is seen. The great future wealth of the interior plateaux will certainly lie in their mineral deposits, the riches of the West Coast region lie in its numerous and valuable vegetable products, of which the most striking are palm oil, and ground nuts, benniseed, shea butter, rubber, gums, spices, cotton, dyes, and valuable timbers, among which ebony occupies a prominent place. With regard to animal products, I might mention ivory and monkey skins. Whereas some of the great races of the interior speak languages which connect them with the Hamitic and Semitic families. The native inhabitants of the West Coast are all that there is of most typically Negro in character; yet I do not mean they are races of particularly low development; on the contrary, the typical Negro is a fine specimen of man, and is by no means as low in his mental state as the races of Polynesia and America. I may cite the Kru tribes of that portion of West Africa which is known as Liberia, a country inhabited by an industrious, energetic, hardworking, stalwart population of free men. An element of heterogeneous ex-slave settlers among the tribes of the coast may be found in some parts of the Colonies of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos. These people represent the Nemesis which invariably follows national crimes. We and our American children indulged to a greater extent than any other European nation in the African slave trade, and, as our wrong-doing was violent and exaggerated, so to a certain extent was the abrupt reparation which followed. Although I would not minimise the work done by our blockade on the West Coast, the abolition of the slave trade was more effectually brought about by the abolition of slavery in the United States of America. One result of our suppression of the slave trade in West Africa has not been altogether advantageous. I refer to the Slave Colonies established at Sierra Leone, and at Fernando Po and other points on the coast. It may be taken that the slaves exported from any district are the least worthy people in it, and the result is that a large proportion of this population is descended from the sweepings of West Africa, and has not yet passed through sufficient generations to eliminate the ancestral badness of its progenitors. So, although here and there a negro has shown what the race can attain to under favourable circumstances, still the bulk of the ""S\'a Leone"" people who are scattered up and down the coast are of an undesirable character, and the cause of indiscriminating blame on the part of superficial observers which is most unjustly laid on the shoulders of the entire population of West Africa; whereas many of these races are superior in intelligence, enterprise, and integrity to any of our negro fellow-subjects in South Africa or the West Indies. What admirable recruits to civilised society can be obtained from many of these people may be instanced by such men as Bishop Crowther, Archdeacons Johnson and Crowther, Samuel Lewis, and other divines and lawyers and officials in West Africa, who are on a par with well-educated white men, and in some cases superior in intelligence and acquirements to the whites with whom they come in contact. It is absurd, however, to regard the Negro race, as a whole, on the same average level as the European—they are far below us. Take them in their native wilds, and they are what we were before Julius Caesar landed in this country; indeed, in many cases they are not 2,000 years behind us, but 10,000. They are in the condition of some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and Gaul, and Spain, whose history we can dimly spell out from their implements and scattered remains, who were undoubtedly cannibals and probably naked, and leading a brutish life. Yet we can in a few years drag them from the condition that prevailed 2,000 years before Christ into the year of grace 1889. We can take a cannibal from the Upper Cross River, and transport him to the centres of civilisation in England or America, where everything represents the utmost result of our present development; but what will be usually the result both with the individual and the race? The savage mind will be unable to grasp and assimilate one-third of the wonders presented to his consideration, and will probably even suffer from the shock. We cannot expect the negroes of West Africa to become all at once intelligent, self-governing people. For many years the white races must be their guardians and educators, and we must educate the negro by force if necessary, leaving him to understand us afterwards, when we have raised him to a condition to do so. This, then, is our mission in West Africa: to instruct the natives that idleness is the eighth deadly sin; next, to so instruct the native as to the existence of the resources of this country; and, lastly, to educate him in the principles of civilised society, and so assimilate his views with our own that he and we may be bound together with the ties of commerce and Empire.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH TRADE WITH WESTERN AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '**BRITISH TRADE WITH WESTERN AFRICA.**\n\n**Mr. Alvan Millson**, Assistant Colonial Secretary for the Colony of Lagos, delivered an address recently before the members of the African Trade Section of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce on the subject of Yorubaland.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1891#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'FRENCH COLONIAL POLICY IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '## West Africa.

This suggests that while negotiation efforts existed, they were frequently overshadowed by coercion and conflict, challenging the notion of peaceful resolution. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize successful negotiations, such as the Treaty of Peace between Liberia and several tribes, and peace treaties involving New Calabar, Bonny, and the King of Ashanti. These articles also highlight the role of colonial administrators in mediating disputes and facilitating peace meetings, illustrating efforts to maintain order through peaceful means.

The consuls served as mediators between the states in the making of peace treaties. Thus, consular-mediated treaties were signed between Bonny and Elem Kalahari (New Calabar) in 1871, Opobo and Bonny in 1873, Bonny and Elem Kalahari in 1879, Elem Kalahari and Okrika in 1871, Nembe and Elem Kalahari in 1871. The inter-state wars did not weaken the resolve of each of the states to keep European traders from encroaching on their spheres of trade or in the maintenance of their sovereignty. The British had clashed with King William Pepple of Bonny as early as 1854, when they exiled him to Fernando Po, Ascension, Sierra Leone and London. They used disturbances caused by local feuds as an excuse. In 1887 they could find no such excuse when they removed Jaja of Opobo for his opposition to direct British trade in the Imo river valley. The rulers of Nembe (Brass), lying on the main Nun estuary of the Niger, were involved in quarrels between exploring and trading British expeditions and local peoples from the 1830s when British citizens got killed or shot at. The final showdown came in 1895, when the Nembe attacked the major depot of the Royal Niger Company at the port of Akassa and destroyed it. This was in protest against the Company's attempt to establish monopoly trade all the way up from Akassa in the delta to Lokoja at the Niger-Benue confluence. Also in 1898, King Ibanichuka of Okrika was seized by the British consul for his refusal to take orders from the new British Protectorate government of Southern Nigeria. King Koko of Nembe managed to escape capture by hiding in remote villages in his kingdom.\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, then, the British had taken over political control of the eastern Niger delta and, for the first two or three decades of the twentieth century, the states could not crown new kings.

The African rulers, like Moshoeshoe, sought to forestall settler colonial rule by acquiring pro› tectorate status. When alarmed by a dissident sect of the Dutch Reformed Church in the Transvaal - the Doppers - who wanted to cross through Tswana territories to Damaraland in 1876, Kgama, king of the Ngwato section of the Tswana, had written to the 'Great Queen of the English People' requesting protection.

An examination of the political treaties suggests the conclusion that some of them were legally indefensible, some morally bank› rupt, while others were procured legally. Nevertheless, they were essentially political acts defensible only in the context of European positive law which saw force as the basis of all law. Even where Africans openly sought treaty arrangements with Europeans, their decisions were invariably based on their perceptions of European strength. There were occasions, too, when Africans who suspected the Europeans' motives for seeking treaties and refused to enter into such a relationship, were induced, through unbearable pressures, none the less to do so. There were also numerous instances in which the Africans and the Europeans disagreed on the interpretation of the arrangements between them. In such cases, as far as the African rulers were concerned, these political treaties did not imply any loss of sovereignty. They tended to regard them as co-operative arrangements, forced or un› forced, which might prove to be of mutual advantage to the parties con- cerned.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The most important and most discussed African component was the local chief. Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'Treaty-making 1885-1902 > The bilateral European partition treaties', 'content': ""The Anglo-German Treaties of 1890 and 1893 and the Anglo-Italian Treaty of 1891, taken together, recognized the Upper Nile as falling within the British sphere of influence.

Just like the first Anglo-Boer War, the Lesotho armed conflict was intimately related to the British efforts to achieve a South African confederation. Both the Cape colonial government and the British officials at the Cape wanted to disarm the African states as a first step to federation. And it was the Sotho rejection of unilateral disarmament that led to the Cape-Sotho War of 1880-1.\nSince 1872 Lesotho had come under the Cape colonial administration.

The Court of Mixed Commissions was also set up at Freetown, Sierra Leone, to try the captains of captured slave ships, and to set free the slaves of condemned slavers. For the delta states, these developments meant the demonstration of British power in their waters, bringing the era of gunboat diplomacy in which the British consuls used naval power to negotiate favourable conditions for British traders, missionaries, and explorers. In practice, the consuls, especially after 1850, continued and stepped up a policy started in the 1830s by Edward Nicolls, Governor of Fernando Po, of signing treaties with the local chiefs.$^{6}$ These treaties stipulated the stoppage of the slave trade by the rulers; the adoption of 'legitimate trade', that is, trade in goods other than slaves; laid down regulations for the conduct of legitimate trade; specified the sums of customs duties or comey to be paid by the traders, as well as subsidies that the British government was to pay the local rulers for their agreement to give up the slave trade.\nThese British activities on the coast gradually eroded the power of the local rulers, especially when the consuls and naval officers assisted the British traders to set up their own judicial systems over and above the law of the local states, the so-called Courts of Equity, composed mainly of British traders with the participation of a few local House Heads or chiefs.

In a statement frequently referred to as most descriptive of the methods which the French actually pursued in this region between the wars, the Governor-General of French West Africa, Joost Van Vollenhoven, remarked in 1917: The chiefs 'have no power of their own, for there are not two authorities in the cercle ... ; there is only one! Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858.

In a similar vein, references have been made to the presence of Asante representatives in all types of states and also to the introduction of substantial Asante features into the Dagomba army or interventions by the Asantehene in Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes. 14 It is obvious nevertheless that the mandates of the Asante regional commissioners varied according to the situation. In the Akan regions they had to ensure that disputes were settled by enforcing observance of the Asantehene's oath so as to emphasize his sovereignty over these territories.

In non-Akan regions, the com¬ missioners strove to strengthen the terms of the 'treaty' between the Asantehene and the Dagomba, for example,16 concerning the tribute. On the other hand, we have no evidence confirming the presence of Gonja or Dagomba contingents in the Asante army or of payment by these countries of the Asante war tax (apeatoo). The settlement of the Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes must therefore be considered as a political act with economic motives: peace in these territories guaranteed payment of the tribute, as well as the introduction of Asante institutions into the Dagomba army.

Colonel Niven, Administrator-in-Chief, attended by request of the parties to witness the signing of the treaty of peace between Lahai Bundoo and Gbannah Lehrey, two powerful chiefs, who had been at war with each other for a long time past. Various Consuls were present, and a guard of honour of 200 men of the 1st West India Regiment also attended. The treaties stipulated that the various parties would act peaceably towards each other, and that in the event of any disputes arising the matters should be referred to the British Governor at Sierra Leone, whose decision would be final. There were some 300 chiefs, present with their headmen, &c., and it is expected that the meeting will put an end to the numerous quarrels and conflicts which have occurred in this district. After the proceedings a number of English and other traders addressed a letter to Colonel Niven, requesting him to allow Day Mauro, King of Bullom, and Allimany Sawassi, Chief Medina, to go up to Fort Hokkoh to settle a war then going on between two powerful chiefs and their followers. They believed that the influence of the two chiefs mentioned could be successfully used to put a stop to further fighting. Colonel Niven promised to consider the matter.\n\nIt was officially announced that the blockade at the port of Brass by the English men-of-war would not take place, as the fine demanded by Commodore Richards had been paid by the natives.\n\nThe English schooner, William the Sixth, belonging to Mr. T.

Its position is indicated on official maps by a square, of which the northern limit is the tenth parallel, and the southern limit lies about 10' above the eighth parallel, the western limit being drawn through 1° 15' west of Greenwich, and the eastern limit through 35' east of Greenwich. These limits do not represent the political frontiers of Native States. They were drawn simply as a matter of mutual convenience as between England and Germany in order to preserve the neutrality of certain important Native trading centres, and the freedom of trade roads, until such time as the hinterlands of the English and German colonies upon the coast should be more definitely delimited, and many Native States lie half within and half without the zone. It will be observed that if the frontier line of the two colonies determined up to the southern limit of the neutral zone were to be prolonged in a straight line, it would leave about one-third of the neutral zone to Germany and two-thirds to England. Of the countries lying to the north of the neutral zone no mention was made in the agreement, but British treaties were in 1892 negotiated with all of them up to the Niger river. Within the zone it was agreed that neither Germany nor England should seek to exercise a preponderating influence or negotiate treaties with the Natives for that purpose, but that all the trading centres, and notably Salaga, should be open to the emissaries of both countries for commercial purposes.\n\nThe agreement was between England and Germany only. France was not a party to it, and to avoid possible complications arising from the fact, measures were taken to secure the British position in the zone as against any Power except Germany. A joint Anglo-German Commission for this purpose was proposed, but the proposal was rejected by the German Government, and Great Britain was forced to act independently. In 1894 a British agent was sent into the zone, and a complete series of treaties was negotiated with the Native chiefs, providing for the maintenance of British authority as against every European Power except Germany. It was carefully explained to the chiefs in every instance that Germany and Great Britain were friends, and that neither was to exercise in the zone an influence inconsistent with the influence of the other. The position was further regularised by full notification to the German Government of all that had been done. As regards any French claims upon the Gold Coast Hinterland, the British position was by these means in 1894 firmly based upon treaty rights concluded throughout the entire territory from the sea coast to the Niger river."", 'last_edit_date': '1897-11-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_11_1897#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Our Peace-making in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The same claim was made by the Ife chiefs in their statement: ""We wish to be reinstated in the town Ile Ife, which is the cradle of the human race.

Eventually ""points of agreement"" were settled, and at the same time Governor Moloney renewed his denunciation of the human sacrifices. The signature of the treaty of peace in July, 1886, marked the close of the negotiations. In August, the Special Commission was sent up to the seat of war to obtain the ratifications, and at the same time to procure the abolition of human sacrifices. On the latter subject the Ekiti chiefs wrote to the Governor, promising to ""take steps as early as possible to legislate for the discontinuance of human sacrifices of all kinds in our respective countries.""\n\nThe Ondos wrote to the same effect. ""Our government being constitutional,"" they said, ""no legislation can be effectually made except it be unanimously agreed to by all the members of our Council.""

At last the efforts made have been crowned with success. The contending factions were grouped into two opposing sides. On the one side were the Ibadans, a powerful tribe situated right in the centre of the region of the war, and, therefore, surrounded by enemies; and on the other was a confederation of tribes under the general name of the Ekitiparapos. Man-catching was the real object of the war, and herein lay the great difficulty in the way of mediation; for it was obvious that none of the man-catching tribes would surrender their main source of revenue without a struggle. However, with the aid of two educated natives, a treaty of peace was signed in July, 1886, and ratified in the following September.\n\nThe first circumstance which opened up a prospect of successful mediation was an intimation received by Administrator Moloney, at Lagos, of a quarrel between the King of the Sebus and his people, the former wanting to continue the war and the latter to end it. It was not till long afterwards that Sir Samuel Rowe felt he was justified in interfering. His first attempt was not encouraging, but ultimately the Kings of the Ekitiparapos confederacy, twenty-six in number, appealed to the Governor, stating their grievances against the Ibadans, and asking him to prevent their being supplied with ammunition from Lagos through the agency of an Ibadan there.\n\nThe answer came from Mr. Moloney, who had assumed the government of the colony, and he addressed it to all the belligerents, rating them soundly for continuing the war, and offering his services as mediator. The replies were favourable. An armistice was arranged, and conferences were held. Statements setting forth the case for each tribe separately were forwarded to the Governor. In one of them (from the commander of the Jebus) the following passage occurs: ""Ile Ife is regarded by all our nation as the sacred spot from which we originated, and the Oni is respected as the father of all the Kings. This is why the Jebu King felt it his duty to reinstate the Ifes in the town. It was from Ile Ife that his father went to settle in the Jebu country. His father did not die, but he was converted into a rock, which could still be seen. Even the English King can be shown the spot at Ile Ife from whence his ancestors went out.

But the case is different in the neighbourhood of Sierra Leone. There the people are divided into a number of very small tribes, and though their wars are sufficient to fill their country with bloodshed and frequently to stop trade, they have never shown inclination or capacity to form anything like a nation. Their wars are all between themselves, and friends and foes are inclined to welcome our interference as arbitrators in their disputes. One must hope that the result so far of Sir Samuel Rowe\'s proceedings will convince those concerned of the uselessness of attempting to govern such a colony by hard-and-fast rules drawn up in London without that intimate knowledge of local peculiarities which is absolutely essential to its welfare.\n\nThe above facts are gleaned from a long and interesting letter, signed ""A West African Merchant,"" which appeared in the _Times_ of July 27th, and which gave rise to further correspondence upon this subject, the salient points of which will be found appended.\n\nThough very true that Sir Samuel Rowe has induced the chiefs to agree to a mutual peace, it seems that so soon as pressure was removed they fell back into their old ways; and when the Governor had departed from Kambia, that place was plundered and burnt; and even now war is raging at Mosaipeh, Mammyah, Masabole, and Bendoom.\n\nSir Samuel Rowe went out to Sierra Leone with no more power to punish the offending natives than had his predecessor, and the native chiefs knew this well enough.

First, they say, with regard to the law of nations, we must ask ourselves whether the chiefs of savage tribes can make treaties, &c., or whether the tribes they represent are considered as States capable of making international treaties. The answer given was, that the rules of the law of nations had been looked upon as the special privilege of Christian races; and it was only in 1856 the Porte, by the Treaty of Paris, was permitted to participate in the advantages of international law and of the European concert. Therefore his opinion is that it was obligatory on these nations that they should recognize these laws, and they could not allow those nations to participate in its advantages who did not recognize this law as obligatory upon themselves. Publicists and moralists taught that Christian sovereigns should conduct themselves honestly, and observe the rules and justice of equity and Christian morality. Feeble, half-savage races, deprived as yet of the benefits of civilization, are now no longer considered merely as prey for the rapacity of civilized nations, or as furnishing a field for their enterprise. But what are the conditions under which a State can be capable of negotiating treaties? According to Klüber, a certain number of men and families congregating together, and fixing their abode in a country, associating themselves and submitting to a common chief with the purpose of insuring the safety of all, form a State. Sovereignty is acquired by a State at the time of its formation, or when it frees itself from a condition of dependence.

The Press has been utilized in various ways. Publications of all sorts, from the octavo volume to the two-paged tract have been issued in a steady stream. The system of supplying newspapers and periodicals with paragraphs bearing on peace and war has, through the kindness of editors, been carried out with great effect. The Ladies' Auxiliary Branch and the Workmen's Peace Association have also been in active operation. A new method of interesting the young in the subject has been adopted by offering prizes to young persons in schools for the best essays on topics connected with the question. The report congratulates the friends of peace on the conclusion of the Afghan war. After spending twenty millions of money in scattering havoc and devastation through that land, we have had to retreat within our own borders, our present rulers having had the courage to withdraw from a position as perilous as it was unjust. The report relates the steps taken by the Committee in reference to the Transvaal question, their deputation to Lord Kimberley, the meetings held in various parts of the country, the memorials presented to the Prime Minister; and they refer to the manner in which the Government, to its infinite honour, persevered in its peace negotiations, even in the face of reverse and defeat. It warns the country against being misled by the wild and alarming reports sent home by a certain class of African colonists who detest the peace, and are bent upon rekindling a war which would subserve their interests at the expense of the mother country, which will have to bear the cost. The report next speaks of M. Richard's motion in the House of Commons, in June last, in favour of a mutual reduction of armaments, which, after eliciting an interesting discussion and an admirable speech from Mr. Gladstone, was carried, not in the original form proposed but in an amended form suggested by Mr. Bright. It refers also to the other Parliamentary resolution, submitted by Mr. Richard last month, on the conduct of British representatives abroad, in contracting engagements and making war without authority from the central Government, which also called forth a most valuable speech from the Prime Minister, and was lost on a division by a majority of only eight in a House of 137. The report dwells with satisfaction on the general interest which the discussion had excited in the Press, as evidenced by the serious and, for the most part, favourable comments of most of the London and provincial papers. It, however, condemns and deplores the continuance of the Basuto war. Finally, it alludes with satisfaction to the frequency of the cases which now occur of states settling their disputes by arbitration, or some form of peaceable reference, instead of an appeal to the sword.

A difference between France and the Republic of Nicaragua was, by the wish of the latter, referred to the arbitration of the French Court of Cassation.

1411,"British colonial authorities strategically engaged in alliances and interventions with African leaders, using diplomacy and gifts to maintain control and influence over local territories.","The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of the British colonial strategy of engaging in alliances and interventions with African leaders through diplomacy and gifts to maintain control and influence over local territories. The General History of Africa highlights how the British offered 'liberation' and 'protection' to weaker African polities, forming alliances with less powerful kingdoms and exploiting African rivalries and fears. They signed treaties with local chiefs to cease the slave trade and promote 'legitimate trade,' often backed by naval power, and used diplomatic maneuvers like treaties and Courts of Equity to undermine local rulers and impose their judicial systems. African leaders, such as the Baganda in Uganda, allied with the British for material benefits and improved status, illustrating the strategic use of alliances. However, the text also notes military interventions, such as the punitive expedition against Benin, indicating a multifaceted approach. Similarly, The African Times articles describe Governor Rowe's diplomatic engagements with chiefs and the use of ""judicious presents of money, gin, and tobacco"" by Sir Samuel Rowe to end inter-tribal wars, aligning with the claim of using gifts as diplomatic tools. The articles also mention treaties for territory cessions and trade protection, while acknowledging challenges like the reluctance of some natives to accept British protectorate status. Together, these sources underscore the complexity of British colonial strategies, combining diplomacy, gifts, and military interventions to exert influence in African territories.","The paragraphs from the General History of Africa textbook provide several details that support the claim that British colonial authorities strategically engaged in alliances and interventions with African leaders, using diplomacy and gifts to maintain control and influence over local territories.

For instance, the articles mention that Governor Rowe received friendly visits from chiefs and sent warnings to the King of Say, indicating diplomatic engagement. Additionally, the Governor-in-Chief, Sir Samuel Rowe, was involved in interviewing native queens and chiefs to end inter-tribal wars, using ""judicious presents of money, gin, and tobacco"" to achieve satisfactory results. This aligns with the claim of using gifts as a diplomatic tool. Furthermore, the articles describe the British expedition up the Niger and the positive reception of British messengers by the King of Foolah Jallo, suggesting strategic alliances.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.71, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': 'The European Scramble for East Africa and the patterns of African resistance > The response in Uganda', 'content': ""Probably the greatest diplomat of all those who had to deal with the advent of imperialism in East Africa in the last decade of the nineteenth century was Mwanga, the Kabaka of Buganda, which had been declared a British Protectorate in 1894. When he ascended the throne in 1894, he seemed to be suspicious of Europeans, mostly missionaries at that time, so he sought to restrict his people's interactions with them. Those among the Baganda who had embraced the Christian faith and who would not obey his orders were put to death as traitors.$^{29}$ Today, Christians regard them as martyrs. Mwanga was, however, violently resisting attempts by British agents to take over his country even though disguised as mission› aries. But his diplomatic ability also became apparent in the way he handled various, often warring religious sects. At one time, he would play the two Christian sects, Catholics and Protestants, against Muslims when he thought the latter were becoming too powerful and therefore threatening his control of the country. At another time, he would ally with Muslims against Catholics or Protestants or both depending on who he thought was dangerous to his rule. Thus, Mwanga was adept at the diplomatic game of divide and rule, a tactic which the colonizing powers were able to use so effectively in controlling Africa. When it was necessary, Mwanga resorted to a revival of some old tradition in an attempt to drive out all foreigners as happened in 1888.$^{30}$ On this occasion, he intended to entice all foreigners and their Baganda followers to a naval parade on an island on Lake Victoria. There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler. Later, however, in 1889, Mwanga managed to regain his throne only to be exiled to Kisimayu, as already indicated, in 1899, where he died in 1903."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Increased European pressures', 'content': ""As we have already mentioned, during the period under discussion East Africa was part of a large informal empire under British control.

The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo.

But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes.

Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule. It assigned a common function to the administrator and the African chief who in assessing and collecting the tax, often in conjunction with local councils of elders or notables, reminded everyone of the regulatory power of the new system.$^{27}$ Furthermore after tax collectors as such, there soon appeared administrative agents who became part of the new colonial elite. The most striking and controversial among them were no doubt the akidas used by the Germans in East Africa.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.712, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Marketing', 'content': ""Certainly, until the early 1930s, the tendency was to encourage whoever was likely to contribute in this respect. Thus Indian traders were not only allowed, but, to some extent, were also encouraged to patronize trade in East Africa, and to some extent in Central Africa. The Asian population in East Africa increased as follows: Uganda: 1910 - 2000; 1917 - 13026; Tanganyika: 1913 - 18784; 1931 - 23422; Kenya: 1921 - 22800; 1931 26759. The 'dislike and distrust of the Levantine communities' in West Africa, which Professor Bauer noticed to be 'marked in official circles', 71 was a relatively recent development. Real hostility towards the Levantines, mostly Lebanese, came not from official circles but from the various European agents of commercial firms, and such hostility was in response to effective trade rivalry presented by the Levantines.$^{72}$ And where British firms appear to have been given preference, it was not because of their respectability, but because they could - with the blessing of the British government - act as effective pressure groups and influence colonial policy› makers. 73 Still, Ehrlich's generalization that 'administrative attitudes, throughout British Africa, rarely encouraged indigenous commercial initiative'$^{74}$ is quite valid. But other factors stifled local initiatives. First of all, general official policy, as would be expected in a colonial situation, was geared primarily towards the advancement of imperialist interests. Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction. By the first decade of the twentieth century, following the construction of railways, European firms were squeezing African traders in two related ways. Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

With the increased assurance of protection thus afforded, British traders have extended their operations in the country, which is extremely fertile in general produce, and especially rich in gold. The Governor of Cape Coast Castle, Sir W.

The progress of the Khartoum Relief Expedition, the better government of Egypt, the high-handed action of the Boers in Zululand, the activity of German aggression on the West Coast, and the vast possibilities involved in the systematic colonisation of the Congo territory, represent only a few of the more urgent considerations now forcing themselves on the country\'s attention. Yet this enumeration, brief though it be, more than suffices to show the extent and importance of English interests in Africa. In view of the active ambition of other nations, these two points cannot be too frequently or too strongly insisted upon; for the physical peculiarities of the ""Dark Continent"" find their counterpart in its political features. Among the great divisions of the globe it occupies an absolutely unique position. Excepting the Valley of the Nile, Cape Colony and the immediately adjoining territories, together with little more than a fringe of coast settlements, Africa might, not long since, have been broadly and generally described as one vast ""No Man\'s Land.""

England had extended to her West African dependencies the privileges of British legitimate trade and commerce, which was a powerful vehicle for the advancement of civilisation.\n\nBringing forward the commercial advancement of the West African Colonies, he said the question had often been asked, ""Do the Colonies pay?"" He could answer with an emphatic affirmative. In 1837 the total external trade of England with all the Colonies was £28,341,471; it was now nearly £300,000,000, thus showing an increase of about ten times. The British shipping in connexion with the Colonies in 1837 was 3,677,975 tons; in 1885 it was 56,611,075 tons. The English Customs returns reckoned the exports to the Colonies in 1837 at £11,283,363; and this had since risen to £54,545,553. Her Majesty\'s Colonies, he said, furnished more than a quarter of the whole world\'s annual supply of gold. He then referred to the commercial geography of the British African Colonies, gave the value of their exports and imports, and reviewed the trade generally. The construction of a railway to the interior of Africa from Lagos was a recent proposition and a new feature in the history of the West African Colonies. It was obvious that Africa was, or would be, the only continent open for the future expansion of British manufacture; in such a case the interior would play an important part. He maintained, with eminent authorities on the subject, that by native agency alone, under foreign supervision necessarily, could tropical Africa be gradually and definitely developed on any permanent basis, and that the negro should be educated industrially and otherwise with the generous help of Europe and America. Whatever was accomplished by native agency, England certainly should carry the credit of effecting such accomplishment in the civilisation of Africa. It was beyond doubt that the English were acknowledged the best colonisers; and the marked consideration invariably shown by them to the people whom they undertook to govern, the extreme liberty and entire privileges of a British subject extended to every native, and the judicious caution characteristic of the policy of the British Government had altogether won for England this success and the preference to all other civilised nations.

Rather more than two years ago, an agreement was concluded at Paris between our Government and that of France with regard to the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence in West Africa. The territories referred to in the agreement were Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast. It was provided that the two Governments should have the right of appointing special Commissions of Delimitation ""to trace upon the spot, wherever they may consider it necessary, the line of demarcation between the English and French possessions"" in conformity with the agreement. The work of determining the boundary line between Senegambia and Sierra Leone is now about to be begun, the British Commissioners having left Liverpool on Saturday last. For some time past British merchants interested in commerce with Sierra Leone have been apprehensive that their trade with the interior might be seriously interfered with, if not absolutely ruined, by a wrongful definition of the boundary.

On the east we are similarly threatened by the Germans. They started with the possession of a small station at Beh, the people of which had long been desirous of entering the protectorate, but their offers were refused by the Government. This year a Commissioner was appointed to define the frontier. A line was decided on extending due north from the coast for a distance of over three miles into the interior. On this decision the Germans immediately annexed the Krepe country as far as the banks of the Volta. The Krepes were formerly in the Danish protectorate when we acquired Quittah and all the Danish possessions. Krepe went with the rest, yet we have allowed the Germans to annex the place. The sympathies of the natives are solely with the British. These German annexations are made by the advice and on the surveys of the Basle missionaries, who have for years been subsidised and protected by the British Government. For the rescue of some of their mission the Ashantee war was undertaken. The importance of these annexations will be seen when one has a knowledge of the trade routes to the interior, as it is upon the trade with the interior that the colony depends. There are three routes. The western is up the Tando River. A very large trade is carried on here, Ashanti being mainly supplied by this route. The command of the River Tando is lost if we permit the French to dispossess us of part of Apollonia and Aowin. The central route is via Cape Coast to Prahsu and Coomassie. A small trade is done here, owing to all the carriage being by land. This route is in British hands so far. The eastern, which will be the more important route, as by it most of the Mussulman trade is carried on, passes by the Volta through Krepe. Unless the Germans are dispossessed of this country, no British trade will be done this way. I hope you will call the attention of your Society to the neglect of British interests by the Government, and to the need for instant action, or else the whole of the British trade in these parts will fall into the hands of other European Powers.

The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment. With the missionaries it can be imagined how these ruffians came in conflict; and so angry were they at the prospect of the missionaries protecting their victims, or interfering with them, that they bribed and frightened the native chiefs, and used every effort to prevent the missionaries obtaining any hold on the country. The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

Sierra Leone, however, has not much to show for its century of British rule. Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary.

In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value. Then as to Zanzibar and British East Africa, they, in their turn, besides securing the southern approach to the dominions of our Egyptian ward, are a necessity to the trade and overflow emigration of our great Indian Empire, with its nearly 300,000,000 of people and its yearly trade with the British Empire of some £90,000,000. The trade of the British Empire with British Africa amounts to about £25,200,000 yearly. Among the more valuable products which British Africa sends us, or supplies to herself, may be cited the following: gold, silver, copper, coal, diamonds, ivory, rubber, palm oil, palm kernels, gums, cotton, dyewoods, indigo, coffee, sugar, rice, Indian corn, horses, cattle, donkeys, hides, amomum seeds, red peppers, and many other valuable dyes, spices, oils, timber, drugs, skins, and farinaceous foods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Leader', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'GREAT BRITAIN commenced her work of colonising Africa by the foundation of Sierra Leone, more than a hundred years ago: and even her best friends must admit that, except in the regions ruled by the Royal Niger Company, the progress of her influence in West Africa has not been very much to her credit.

Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs.

The advance made during the closing year relates chiefly to East Africa, where the German East African Company has continued its career of activity. Several additions have been made to the vast region under Germany's protection in that part of the Dark Continent, and, what is more, steps have been taken to accelerate the development of the lands acquired, and to prepare the way for trade.

Steps are now being taken to form a plantation company which will carry on operations in East Africa, and will cultivate tobacco, cotton, cocoa, &c.

The first was the new interest which the Duke of Brabant, crowned a constitutional king (Leopold I) of the Belgians in 1865, proclaimed in Africa. This was signified by the so-called Brussels Geographical Conference which he convened in 1876 and which resulted in the setting up of the African International Association and the employment of H. M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

In Mozambique their effective control was by 1800 limited to Mozambique Island; elsewhere they depended more on Brazilian and mulatto merchants than on Portuguese officials. The increased demand for slaves in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century had shifted attention from the prazo system, and the security of the trade routes depended more on the pombeiros (barefoot mulatto merchants), bearing Brazilian trade-goods and surviving only on the good will of African rulers and merchants.$^{10}$ The French had revived their trading posts in Senegambia after 1815, notably Saint-Louis and GorØe.

The British had established Freetown and the agricultural villages on the neighbouring peninsula as centres for the acculturation of freed slaves into a Creole culture.

Events certainly played their part, and the military setbacks inflicted on the Portuguese by the Africans go some way towards explaining the ebb of colonial occupation during the period 1862-72. Personalities also influenced developments; certain governors were associ› ated with an aggressive policy of maximum occupation, others with a retreat to coastal bases. However, these factors do not assume their real significance unless they are placed in the context of world economic developments, particularly in so far as they affected the Portuguese economy. Indeed, Portuguese imperialism did not escape the general rules of colonial expansion in the nineteenth century. 19 The determination of the protectionists to ensure that Portugal and its colonies were united in an economic system independent of the great industrial powers was reflected in the first attempts to set up a white colony in the south of Angola, beginning on the coast at Moçâmedes, and at Huila in the Nyaneka country. The spirit of conquest was still uppermost in the 1850s, with sustained Portuguese efforts to occupy territory and eliminate competition from African traders, in particular the Imbangala and the Kongo. Not until i860 or thereabouts, following some years of thriving trade, was a turning-point reached, with the Portuguese increasingly adopt› ing a policy of withdrawal. From 1862 to 1875, the colonial power continued to retreat, suffering a series of military defeats at Cassanga in 1862, and in the Dembo country in 1871-2, which the government at Luanda did not seek to avenge. By the early 1870s the withdrawal was complete. The colonial power in Angola had fallen back to the coast, and Africans were rapidly gaining control of trade in the sertào. Silva Porto, the leading sertanejo of the BiØ area, lost his entire fortune in this period under the pressure of competition from the Ovimbundu traders.

The lesser powers, with no great prestige at stake, managed to get on without any new imperialism, though Portugal and Holland displayed a revived pride in the empires they already possessed and the latter's was administered with renewed vigor. 1S Hayes concludes therefore that 'the new imperialism' was basically 'a nationalistic phenomenon' and that its proponents hankered after national prestige. European leaders, in short, having consolidated their nations and realigned their diplomatic forces at home, were propelled by a nebulous or atavistic force which expressed itself in a 'psychological reaction, an ardent desire to maintain or recover national prestige'.

The foremost exponents of this view, Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher, who stress the strategic importance of Africa to India for Britain, blame the partition of Africa on the impact of atavistic \'protonationalist\' movements in Africa which threatened the global strategic interests of European nations. These \'romantic, reactionary struggles\' gallant anachronisms in their view - compelled reluctant European states› men, hitherto content to exercise informal paramountcy and moral suasion in Africa, to partition and conquer the continent. Africa was occupied, therefore, not because of what it could offer materially to the Europeans for it was economically worthless - but because it was threatening European interests elsewhere. 18 One primary aim of the psychological theories as well as of their cousins, the diplomatic theories, has been to debunk the notion that the partition of Africa was motivated by economic impulses. But the prestige argument only appears unconvincing when its economic concomitant is eliminated or unduly played down. Hayes, for example, has documented in detail the tariff war which took place between the European nations during the crucial period of the partition. \'$^{9}$ He even concedes that, \'What actually started the economic push into the ""Dark Continent"" and the sun-baked islands of the Pacific was not so much an overproduction of factory goods in Europe as an under-supply of raw materials\';$^{20}$ and that therefore \'to prevent too much of the world from being ... monopolized by France, Germany, Italy, or any other protectionist power, Great Britain moved mightily to gather the lion\'s share into her own free-trade empire\'.

H. Brunschwig, too, while positing a non-economic interpretation of French imperialism was faced with the stark economic dimension of empire, and was thus compelled to assign it some role.

Both the British and the French soon discovered the obvious: that the real value of Lagos or Porto Novo was to be measured in terms of the trade with the hinterland in the Yoruba and Aja interior which the two ports shared. This involvement of both Britain and France in the trade and politics of Lagos and Porto Novo respectively sparked off a spell of dramatic rivalry between the two powers in a bid to control Yorubaland, especially the western parts, and the adjacent Aja-speaking communities. In this Anglo-French rivalry, western Yorubaland became the main theatre because of the positive response of the local peoples, who saw in the European interventions the solution to the problem of the continuous invasion of their area by their more powerful neighbours.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.624, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Cameroon coast and its hinterland 14', 'content': ""British interest in the abolition of the slave trade and the establishment of legitimate trade led to treaties and the gradual loss of the sovereignty of the local rulers.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press.

On the other hand, the English plan was bound to attract opposition from interests likely to be damaged by forcible suppression. States opposed it in the name of their national sovereignty, for the right of search and joint commissions presupposed a partial surrender of that sovereignty. They saw abolition as an aspect of the wicked machinations of the British in their bid for world hegemony, backed by the absolute superiority of the Royal Navy. They opposed it on the grounds of the damage that would be done to navies, colonies and national trading interests. Portugal, Spain, the USA and France used and distributed cotton, sugar, coffee and tobacco produced on slave plantations dependent on the import of Africans into Brazil, Cuba, the Southern States of the USA and the West Indies.

One or two partially navigable rivers empty their waters into the large bay, and flow down from the hunting grounds of the interior.

We shall not call in question the impartiality of the judge, nor deny that there is some force in the technical grounds upon which he bases his decision. We believe, however, that the issue is to be deplored in the interests of civilization and commerce, and that the process by which it has been arrived at demonstrates conclusively that it is an utter mistake to resort to arbitration for the settlement of controversies of the class to which the Delagoa Bay case belongs. It is for the most part on purely technical grounds that the Marshal has given judgment in favour of Portugal. He finds that she discovered Delagoa Bay in the sixteenth century, and ""that in the seventeenth and eighteenth she occupied \'various points\' on the northern coast of it. Against this, the facts that she has never exercised any real sovereignty over it, and that it was practically in the possession of the native chiefs when it was transferred to us in 1823, are set down as of no force whatever. The development of the country is wrested from the hands of a Power equal to the task, and handed over to a nation which, once a great colonizing agency, is now effete and incapable of enterprise. Why, it may be asked, does Portugal, after having tacitly acquiesced for many years in the cession of the territory to England, suddenly come forward to assert the pretensions which she had practically abandoned? It is not due to a fervid zeal for the amelioration of the condition of the natives nor even to the sense of a capacity to develop the natural advantages and resources of the Bay and its adjacent territories. There is reason to assume that her passion for the possession was inspired by the circumstance that she had found a purchaser for it. Delagoa Bay, which is about fifty miles across, and has splendid riding-ground for ships of the largest class, is one of the most important of all the natural harbours on the East African Coast. It is conveniently situated for purposes of trade, and is therefore much resorted to by vessels of all nations trading to the East African ports. The Portuguese, with their limited means, could not make much capital out of it, but certain speculators of the Transvaal Republic perceived the advantages to be secured by obtaining for their inland State a harbour so favourably situated for communication with the world beyond. They knew it was hopeless to obtain it by purchase from England, and there is reason to believe that Portugal has been encouraged to claim the Bay on the faith of an assurance that, once in possession, she will speedily find a buyer for it.

It did not, however, in any way surprise us. Not that we had at all antecedently made up our minds that Portugal had any valid claim to the whole of Delagoa Bay,—we were no more satisfied then that such was the case than we are now; but that we hold it to be almost impossible for any foreign arbitrators to pronounce in favour of Great Britain in any territorial dispute whatever that may be referred to them. We have had some experience at foreign Courts; we know something of the bitter feeling which exists everywhere among those whom a foreign arbitrating Sovereign would consult, and whose decision would become the decision of that Sovereign, respecting the widely extended possessions of Great Britain in every quarter of the globe; and we should hesitate, if any share of Ministerial responsibility rested on us, to vote for referring a dispute between Great Britain and any other Power to such arbitration, unless it were a matter that must be disposed of in order to avert the bitter arbitrament of war, and in which it were better far that we should lose, however unjustly, than that we should maintain our right at the expense of human blood and human misery, which are necessarily war\'s attendants. There was not any such reason why this Delagoa Bay matter should have been referred to arbitration, and we never could understand why it was so referred at all. Portugal has no good use for Delagoa Bay. There is no chance of her extending her settlements there, because she has not the power to effect such extension. A determination on the part of Great Britain to maintain her right to Inyack Island and Peninsula, and Elephant Island, with the southern shores of the Bay, would not have inflicted any hardship on Portugal, or caused her the slightest loss or inconvenience in any good object she might have in view, to atone for the injury she has done of late years by her settlement at Mozambique, and authority exercised over the northern and north-western portions of Delagoa Bay. We think, therefore, that it was a needless courting of injustice and injury, a needless placing in jeopardy important future interests of our South African Colonies and their people, to have gratified Portugal by agreeing to a reference respecting her claim to Inyack Island and the southern portion of the Bay. The British Government might at least have waited until after 1878 to see how, and in what spirit, Portugal should have fulfilled those treaty obligations by which she has bound herself to put an end to negro slavery in all parts of her dominions. It has been done, however, with the result usually attending arbitrations where British rights and claims are in dispute, and we must abide by the issue. It has been decided by Marshal MacMahon\'s advisers, and the decision has been confirmed by him, that Portugal is entitled to all that Great Britain claimed in Delagoa Bay. What will she do with it? Occupy, fortify, and colonize it, she cannot. She might, perhaps, have managed to do it in a certain fashion had she not been under treaty obligations as regards the slave-trade, and for the cessation of all slavery within her territories after another two years. Now she is entirely unable to do so. The Standard, in the article we transferred last month to our columns, containing the best comments made by the daily press on the subject, states there is reason to assume that the passion of Portugal for the present right of possession was inspired by the circumstance that she had found a purchaser, and that the purchaser will be ""certain speculators of the Transvaal Republic."" We shall be glad if it be so, though we do not believe it. We should be glad of it, because the acquisition of the territory and sea rights on the part of the Transvaal Republic by purchase would obviate a future necessity of acquiring these by force of arms. We look forward to the time when there will be but one Government ruling the entire territory from Table Bay to Delagoa Bay; and it would be absurd to imagine for a moment that such a Government would treat as anything better than waste paper the supposed title conferred by the late award of the President of the French Republic. We must confess that our fears, when we beheld the persistent efforts of Portugal to obtain, if possible, the confirmation of supposed rights, which, if obtained, she could not directly utilize, pointed in a direction widely different from that of the Transvaal Republic. Whatever may be the case at present, we have reason to believe that those fears were not at that time groundless. We hope, though we are far from entirely believing it, that they are so now; because to have beheld those fears realized, would have been to witness a complication in the affairs of South-eastern Africa that would far outweigh any advantages to that portion of the world which the presence there of another strong civilizing European Power might have conferred, had there not been neighbouring civilized Colonies rapidly rising to empire.'}, {'id': 3341, 'article_title': 'The Annexation of the Transvaal', 'full_section_title': 'The Annexation of the Transvaal', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1877#article-15', 'issue_date': '01_06_1877', 'content': 'Federation will possess a power of extension that Portugal or any other country would vainly endeavour to oppose, while its desires were limited to the acquisition of a northern boundary, indispensable to the full development of its resources.

The South African Confederation, we again affirm, must embrace the whole territory from Table Bay to Delagoa Bay. The tide of occupation will now speedily spread over the unoccupied northern portion of it; and British colonists will certainly not submit to Portuguese colonial rule in lands which they themselves will have redeemed from the waste—in towns and harbours which they themselves will have created. We protested at the time against Marshal MacMahon’s Award, because we did not consider it to be justified by the evidence on which his decision was supposed to be founded, because we could not admit the principle sought to be established by the decision, and because the Award sowed the seed of future conflict or unjust exaction. The question was very unwisely submitted to arbitration by the British Government, because Portugal was not prepared to plant colonies on those southern shores of Delagoa Bay should the Award be in her favour; so that there were not any material interests in immediate jeopardy; while the future of the South African Colonies pointed so unavoidably in that direction, that no risk of jeopardizing the future of that infant empire should have been incurred. It is now greatly to be desired that some arrangement should be made between Great Britain and Portugal for an abandonment by the latter of all claim to the said shores.

Men will think twice before embarking their capital or their energies in settlements which may at any moment be repossessed by the Power which originally discovered them. Marshal MacMahon lays it down with perfect truth that Portugal can show this title; but how can the fact of the discovery of Delagoa Bay and its dependencies in the sixteenth century make good her pretensions to exercise sovereign rights over them in the nineteenth? If Portugal held now all the territories she has ever discovered, she would be a considerable Power; but in her weakness and decay she has neglected them, and let them slip from her hold, and she cannot expect to resume her sovereignty over them after the lapse of centuries merely because she may perceive a chance of selling them. Again, it is true, as Marshal MacMahon observes, that Portugal has several times claimed sovereign rights over the whole Bay and the territories bordering it, and has twice supported her pretensions by force of arms, the last occasion being in 1781. But what has been the position of Portugal in East Africa during the present century? Its enterprise had died out, the native populations it had subjected threw off its yoke, and everywhere it was supplanted. As British colonization, and the authority and presence of the British Government with it, swept along the coasts of Southern and Eastern Africa, we advanced up to Delagoa Bay, and there we found no trace of Portuguese sovereignty, but that the territories were under the rule and in the possession of the native chiefs. We treated with them, and such rights as we now claim we hold in virtue of contracts and engagements freely entered into by them, without exciting any protest on the part of the Portuguese Government. On the strength of these engagements, British settlers established themselves on the southern shores of the Bay and the territories in its vicinity without the slightest sign of opposition from the Portuguese Government, which has never, until within the last few years, given any indication that it claimed sovereign rights over them. We cannot think that Marshal MacMahon has satisfactorily disposed of the rights thus acquired by Great Britain. He takes the case of the treaty concluded in 1823 between Captain Owen, on behalf of England, and the native chiefs of Tembe and Maputo. Upon this the Marshal observes that, ""although the accidental weakening of the Portuguese authority in those parts may in 1823 have led Captain Owen erroneously, yet in good faith, to regard the native chiefs as really independent of the Crown of Portugal, the conventions concluded with them were none the less contrary to the rights of Portugal."" It seems to us hardly fair to speak of Portugal\'s practical abandonment of such sovereign rights as she ever possessed—a state of things which had lasted for a considerable number of years—as ""an accidental weakening of the Portuguese authority."" For a century past the power of Portugal has been shrivelling up all along the coast of Eastern Africa.

I am not aware of any treaties with England in which she has recognized the ‘indisputable rights of sovereignty of Portugal over territories situated on the West Coast of Africa between lat. 5 south and 8·12 south.’ My contention is that Portugal has never, up to the year 1868, exercised any of the rights of sovereignty over that part of the coast. The officers of Her Majesty\'s squadron were instructed to inform the chiefs that England did not recognize the sovereignty of Portugal; that the limit of her colony was Ambriz, north of which she had no right to levy duties. From that town north to Cape Lopez Gonsalvez, up to 1870, the English senior officer of the Southern division was appealed to by people of all nations when difficulties arose with the natives, which were usually settled by an amicable ‘palaver.’ Sometimes force had to be resorted to. To take one instance, the Dutch at Banana had a disagreement with the chiefs of Porta da Zinha, and their factory there was threatened with an attack. They represented the case to me. We ran up the River Congo with one of their vessels in tow, lay with our guns covering their factory, and kept a watch at their quarters for forty-eight hours. The goods were shipped, and their *employés* brought off in safety. But before we were a gun-shot distant on return down the river, the natives rushed in, and the factory was in flames. Life and much property was saved, and not a shot was fired. Instances might be multiplied without end to prove that England supplied the police of the river, and that in squabbles between white men and natives, and even between rival factories, the British man-of-war was constantly appealed to. Their doctors, without payment, did their best for Hamburghers, Portuguese, or English, and their crews were ever ready to help a vessel of any nation in difficulty or distress. I grant the willingness of the Portuguese to assist, but they were seldom there, and they had nothing like sufficient force. Portugal may have indisputable rights of sovereignty, but prior to 1870 she certainly did not, or simply could not, exercise those rights. The foreign slave-trade in the territory claimed by Portugal may be said to have come to an end in 1865. Prior to that time, so far from the authorities at St. Paul de Loanda having encouraged legitimate trade, they seemed to do what they could to prevent it. And who can wonder? They wished to force that trade to pass through their own custom-houses to pay something to the State, and as much as possible to the officers...', 'last_edit_date': '1884-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1884#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In defiance of these protests, the Portuguese Government has forfeited the Concession.

The arrangement was made without her consent and in disregard of her claims to the piece of territory under dispute. She acts, therefore, in contravention of it, and when it is pleaded by the Sultan of Zanzibar she treats the plea as a mere subterfuge, and sets it aside without discussion of its terms. The Commissioners' conclusions, it should be stated, were by no means very acceptable to the Sultan of Zanzibar; for they dealt not only with the boundary-line between Portugal and his own territory, but with the rival claims of Germany and Zanzibar, to the extensive inland region between the Kilimanjaro and the Rovuma river. This region the Sultan most unwillingly gave up, out of respect only to the verdict of the Commissioners. The only consideration he could have looked for in consideration of this surrender was the assurance of his right to all territory which the Commission recognized as his. The northern half of Tungi Bay was unquestionably a part of this. The boundary-line was drawn after a thorough inquiry into the facts, which showed that the sovereignty of that portion of the coast belonged to Zanzibar, and not to Portugal—indeed, the Commissioners found there no trace of Portuguese influence or interests. Their decision was, therefore, really little else than a recognition of facts. Its acceptance was forced on Zanzibar; and surely it was equally binding on all parties whom it concerned, and those benefited by it are under obligation to see that the arrangement is maintained intact. The report of the occupation by Portugal of territory not her own is accompanied by the news that the Portuguese subjects in the island of Zanzibar have been placed under the protection of the German flag. It yet remains to be seen what Great Britain will do under these circumstances. Our interference is undoubtedly called for, as being one of the Powers most concerned in the maintenance of the *status quo ante*, and because British Indian subjects are settled in this newly-annexed district, and engaged in lawful trade under treaty rights valid against Zanzibar, though not as against Portugal. We are, therefore, greatly concerned in upholding the authority of the Sultan of Zanzibar in territory we have acknowledged as belonging to him. The southern shore of the Miningani is the appointed boundary for five miles inland. The settlement was made at the end of 1886. It looks, therefore, like a deliberate insult on the part of Portugal to choose this time for the violent assertion of claims which she had allowed to lapse, and which most certainly she cannot be permitted to revive just when they have been formally declared invalid. As to how or in what manner the Sultan of Zanzibar has incurred the hostility of Portugal, we are not concerned. But if the reliance of the Sultan on the judgment of the Commission is an insult to Portugal, what can be said of its contemptuous disregard by the latter? Portugal has no scruple in measuring herself against Zanzibar: she could hardly complain if England were to treat her in the same way, and repel force by force.

The memorial pointed out that the occupations by France and the late annexations by Germany of small portions of the West Coast of Africa tended to break the continuity of the British protectorate, and to bring about a greater conflict of national interests. The influence of the British authorities with the natives was lessened, and the introduction of different principles of trading seriously affected the prosperity of British trades. The duties upon spirits, arms, and ammunition levied in the British settlements furnished the greater portion of the Government revenues. In German and French settlements these articles were free from duty, and being to a great extent sold in the same markets as the British goods, competition became so keen that the loss to British revenue and trade must ultimately be very great. The Committee recommended that the Chamber should ask the Foreign Office that while negotiations regarding African territories were pending, something might be done, by exchange or otherwise, to induce Germany, at least, to withdraw from the ports where British trade had become established, and where rivalry upon different commercial and political principles was so injurious. The Government might also take into consideration the extension of the British protectorate to the unoccupied portions of the coast alluded to.

But there has been a dispute for years between France and Spain as to the possession of an area of some 50,000 square miles on the river Muni, to the north of the Gaboon, at the head of the Bay of Corisco, embracing a coast-line of over 100 miles, extending from the Rio Campos to Cape Santa Clara. A joint Commission is now sitting in Paris for the purpose of settling the question. Spain claims that her rights extend into the interior as far as the river Mobangi. France disputes this claim, and is only prepared to allow Spain a small area on the coast. The claims of Spain to the Muni region are of somewhat old date. By a treaty concluded with Portugal in 1777, the latter ceded to Spain the islands of Fernando Po and Annobon, as also the right to trade on the coast between the mouths of the Niger and Cape Lopez, a coast-line which Portugal claimed as belonging to her. Many years since Spanish traders settled on Corisco Island, and had stations on the opposite coast, which were used as depôts for slaves from the interior till they could be shipped across the Atlantic. In 1843 the chiefs of Corisco Island, as well as those on the opposite coast, north and south of the Muni, according to Spanish authorities, formally recognised the sovereignty of Spain. How far the jurisdiction of these chiefs extends is the point to be settled by the joint Commission. The French have had to intervene at various times to maintain order in the district which is claimed by Spain, and maintain that the area to which Spain has any real claim is a mere patch on the coast round Cape St. Jean. France does not contest the claim of Spain to Corisco Island, though she doubts her right to the Elobey islands, in which are French and German factories.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Models of African initiatives and reactions', 'content': ""War-weariness and insecurity contributed greatly to the acceptance of British wardship or alliance on the part of several African polities and individuals.

Although they appreciated western education brought by the Americo-Liberians and white missionaries, some of their elders opposed the propagation of Christianity and other interference with their laws and customs.\nLacking effective military might, trained administrative personnel, and funds, the Liberian government could not implement its plans for effective occupation of Liberian territory by building roads, railways, military and administrative posts and Americo-Liberian settlements across its length and breadth, or by co-operating with interior chiefs by paying them regular stipends and inviting them to 'represent' their people in the Liberian legislature as 'referees'. Hence when the Europeans commenced their Scramble in about 1880 (culminating in the Berlin Conference of 1884-5), Liberia seemed likely to lose to them vast stretches of the territory she already claimed.$^{6}$ The Liberian government was therefore concerned during the Scramble primarily to preserve territory it had already acquired."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

The professed European desire to keep Africa as militarily neutralized as possible was in fact never realized. The French introduced a law of conscription in 1919 whereby an African contingent of 10000 was to be annually obtained; the British developed a Sudan Defence Force, uniquely staffed by Sudanese as well as by British officers, but primarily directed to imperial strategic needs in the Near East as well as in East Africa. The Force Publique of the Belgian Congo, exhibiting the qualities both of occupation army and police force, was frequently used during this era to quell resistance expressed in the form of syncretistic religious movements.$^{29}$ On the scale of open warfare, events can be easily measured. The Italian campaign to subdue Libya in the 1920s and the Spanish and French effort to resolve the Rïf war in Morocco in the same period are obvious. But they are surpassed in scope by the rapacious war undertaken by Mussolini against the Ethiopians, an event with which the period here under consideration was tragically closed.\nThis account of military developments in Africa in the inter-war period does not seriously impair the assertion that divergent intentions of European colonial method and practice are those which, in retrospect, seem the most significant. There is little doubt that colonial bureaucratiza› tion did provide partial preparation for an unintended movement towards national independence. The configurations of a new political elite were slowly emerging, as lower-echelon clerks and appointed chiefs in various colonial services - but particularly the British - were learning to apply, if only modestly, Napoleon's imperative: 'careers open to talent'.

It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.\nJohn D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty. To them, there could be no compromise on that, and indeed many of the leaders of these states chose to die on the battlefield, go into voluntary flight or face exile rather than surrender their sovereignty without a struggle.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'Politics and nationalism in British West Africa > Inter-territorial movements and international movements: the National Congress of British West Africa', 'content': ""Having been told that they had no history worth taking seriously, and conscious of the fact that their own socio-economic group had limited opportunities in the colonial system, it is perhaps not surprising that the nationalist intelligentsia came to prefer a visionary 'West African national› ity' to a political system in which they had no voice and which, in any case, was alien and therefore, in their view, oppressive.

The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy.

As we shall see below, in 1889, while Cecil Rhodes was preparing to occupy the land of the Ndebele, their king, Lobengula, dispatched a delegation to London to see Queen Victoria; and while the British invading army was marching towards Kumasi in 1896 to seize Prempeh five years after he had turned down the British offer of protection, he dispatched a powerful diplomatic mission to Queen Victoria. As seen above, Menelik addressed a similar appeal to the same monarch as well as to other European heads of state.\nIt is also obvious from some of the quotations above that many African rulers did in fact welcome the new changes that were steadily being intro› duced from the third decade of the nineteenth century since these changes had hitherto posed no threat to their sovereignty and independence. In West Africa, for instance, thanks to the activities of the missionaries, Fourah Bay College had been founded as early as 1827 in Sierra Leone, while elementary schools and a secondary school each in the Gold Coast and Nigeria had been established by the 1870s. Indeed, a call for the establish› ment of a university in West Africa by the Caribbean-born pan-Africanist, Edward Wilmot Blyden had already gone out. As early as 1887 some of the wealthy Africans had even begun to send their children to Europe for further education and professional training and some of them had returned to the Gold Coast as fully qualified barristers and doctors.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'Conquest and reaction in French West Africa, 1880-1900', 'content': ""It is quite clear from the available evidence that the French - from 1880 onwards - adopted a policy of extending their control over the whole region from the Senegal first to the Niger and then Chad and linking these areas with their posts on the Guinea coast in Ivory Coast and Dahomey. The execution of this policy was entrusted to officers of the Senegalese area. As one would expect, therefore, in their occupation of West Africa, the French resorted almost exclusively to the method of military conquest rather than the conclusion of treaties of protectorate as the British did. In terms of African reactions, all the options open to them were resorted to, namely, submission, alliance and confrontation. However, as will be seen below, far more of the rulers opted for the strategy of militant confrontation than those of submission and alliance while opposition here was far more protracted than anywhere else in West Africa for two main reasons. The first, as pointed out already, was that the French used the method of military conquest almost exclusively, which consequently evoked militant reaction. The second was that the people were far more Islamized than those of the other areas of West Africa, and as Michael Crowder has pointed out, since 'for Muslim societies of West Africa the imposition of white rule meant submission to the infidel which was intolerable to any good Muslim',$^{2}$ they tended to resist the Europeans with added fervour and tenacity often lacking among nonMuslims.

As A. G. Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""However, as Professor Adu Boahen has correctly pointed out, it is a distortion of African history to see it in terms of heroes and villains. This approach fails to consider the prevailing circumstances under which various groups or individuals operated. The options available to them and their interpretations of these options may have been different from those imposed on them by politicians and scholars alike. It makes sense, as Boahen has suggested, to see the events of the time and their key actors in terms of diplomacy, pursued independently or backed by force. To appreciate the extent to which diplomacy could go, it is necessary to understand the socio-economic forces operating in a particular society at the time of the encounter. For East Africa, a survey of such factors in the 1890s will be an appropriate setting for the events that followed. But, as R. I. Rotberg and Ali Mazrui state: 'There is no gainsaying that the introduction of Western norms and power and accompanying controls was everywhere in Africa questioned by the people affected'. 2 This questioning, however, took various forms. 'The response to the in› vasion was determined by the structure of each society at the time. Though all societies were determined to preserve their sovereignty, the reaction to invasion was not uniform.'$^{3}$ Variations occurred in accordance with the social cohesion or otherwise of a given society.\nIn the 1890s - the period that preceded European occupation of East Africa - the societies of the region had achieved differing stages of social organization.$^{4}$ Some, such as the Baganda and the Banyoro in Uganda, the Banyambo in Tanganyika (now Tanzania) and the Wanga in Kenya, had achieved a high degree of centralized government (see Fig. 7.1). In such societies, response to foreign penetration tended to be dictated by the king or the leadership as a whole. What had existed in Europe at one time - 'The religion of the king is my religion' - sums up the attitude well. Other societies, such as the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika or the Nandi in Kenya were in the process of forming centralized governments. This process is often referred to as state formation. However, the vast majority of societies in this region did not have centralized governments. But lack of central governments does not imply lack of government, a mistake which some foreigners commenting on African societies have made in the past."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 547, 'article_title': 'House of Commons', 'full_section_title': 'House of Commons', 'last_edit_date': '02-17-1865', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1865#article-16', 'issue_date': '23_02_1865', 'content': 'THE KINGDOM OF ASHANTEE.**\n\nSir J.

The Ashantis being, the Fantis, still nearly ten to one, the kings and chiefs solicit the Government to turn out every man capable of bearing arms to go to their assistance at once, as, if they did not, they would be compelled to fall back. Now this report is rather alarming, as, if our forces are attacked at Yankumassie, they cannot hold it for any length of time, and they must give up the position and retire on Dunkwa, which is almost as untenable, and could be taken or turned by a dashing onward movement or flank attack, and this would place the enemy in a position to intercept all communications overland between this and the towns to leeward, and Cape Coast itself would be open to attack at any hour that the enemy might choose. As for Anamabu and the other towns, they would not be safe for a single moment.\n\nWe learn that as far back as 1869, or thereabouts, at any rate shortly after the interchange of territories, the Home Government instructed our Local Government on no account to interfere, either physically or otherwise, in _any_ war or wars between us and our enemies; and on no account to embroil Great Britain in _any_ war out here.

He and those with him had been doing their best to liberate slaves, and if General Gordon returned from Khartoum by the routes suggested to him, he could and would do his best to discountenance slavery and in this way revenge himself on the Mahdi. He did not personally know Gordon. He had had a letter from him, but had never been personally brought in contact with him. He further stated that it would be easy for General Gordon alone to proceed to Uganda, where he could meet any number of caravans, and in one of these proceed to Zanzibar. Then he could escape by means of Gondinoka, which could be reached by steamer from Khartoum. The distance from Gondinoka to Khartoum was about 500 miles. It would be eight days' journey by steamer. This journey has been accomplished by Sir Samuel and Lady Baker, Speke, and Schweinfurth. From Gondinoka a fifteen days' march would bring him into a safe country.\n\nWe must think of the consequences of an expedition to relieve Gordon, the immense expense and the terrible loss of life which must ensue from travelling through the country. English soldiers would drop off faster than you could count them almost. You would have to provide an abundance of provisions and an abundance of doctors—I should say one doctor to every twenty-five men. In view of all these responsibilities any Government—I care not whether it be Liberal or Conservative—should fully consider the situation before they launch into a Quixotic enterprise of this kind. If Gordon were one of those useless creatures who could do nothing for himself, then perhaps it would be well to send a relief expedition to him. But in the case of a man with Gordon's powers and resources, and having in view also the many steamers which the Egyptian Government have on each of the routes he may escape by, I think that no relief expedition is needed, provided he is willing to leave Khartoum.\n\nIn conclusion, Mr. Stanley said that General Gordon would assuredly escape, as the natives would hesitate to attack one so well protected. He had no doubt the General could easily make an escape, even almost single-handed, by travelling through the country, as Commander Cameron, R.N., had done before him.""}, {'id': 5997, 'article_title': 'LATEST FROM SIERRA LEONE.', 'full_section_title': 'LATEST FROM SIERRA LEONE.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_09_1890', 'content': ""Early this year the Governor sent Mr. Commissioner Garrett to Samudoo, the West African Mahdi.

In spite of the repeated warnings of those who were possessed of an intimate knowledge of the requirements of our Colonies upon the Atlantic seaboard, nothing effectual was done towards securing our position there, in response to the great expenditure of blood and treasure which for more than a century our missionaries of religion and commercial pioneers have ungrudgingly yielded up for the benefit of the Native and the extension of Great Britain\'s influence and prestige. For fully two centuries Great Britain appeared to enjoy a complete monopoly for colonisation, and it seemed as if the other European Powers were quite content to occupy themselves entirely with home politics, and leave to her the task of carving new empires out of the comparatively unknown continents to the west, the south, and the east. But the last twenty years has seen a complete change in this respect, and now Great Britain in all her movements abroad has to consider her position as affected by similar actions on the part of France and Germany. Besides the loss of prestige which is bound to accompany the entrance of other European Powers into districts hitherto held to be subject only to British ""influence"" or occupation, we have to deplore the great blow to our commerce which must result from other markets being opened to the Natives of the interior through the advent of French and German goods into places which have hitherto been dependent upon the factories of England for their supplies of cotton goods and hardware, &c. It is true that these difficulties and objections, even if seen, could not well be avoided, as it is only natural that other European nations—when freed from the necessity of keeping up a standing army out of all proportion to the size of the population—should try to open up fresh markets for the products of its factories and looms, and the only way in which the English pre-eminence could be maintained is by furnishing manufactures which, for quality and price, are superior to the productions of other lands. But that is by no means the worst feature of the case. For the last five or six years French explorers, some commissioned by the Paris authorities, and some not, have been traversing the interior in all directions, and making treaties with the various minor potentates, who for the most part were not, strictly speaking, in a position to bind their lands or their people to any other Power than Great Britain; and little by little French influence and authority has been extending over districts hitherto considered to be within the sphere of the latter. Now we find the authorities at home are awaking to the perilous position of our colonies on the West Coast, and the recent movements of a French force upon Nikki has afforded them the opportunity for a strong protest against any further attempted extension of French authority within the British sphere. It is scarcely conceivable—in spite of all the bluster of the French Press—that the two Powers will appeal to force over this and kindred questions; but there is a limit to concession on our side as well as our neighbour\'s, and it is quite time that some definite steps were taken to secure to Great Britain all that is left to her of what might have been a large and invaluable possession.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-11-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_11_1897#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'GREAT BRITAIN AND FRANCE IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Colonial policy of Great Britain and France in West Africa has been widely different.

This object she has attained by a large and constant expenditure, and by a succession of military expeditions. She has overcome by arms the Almamy Ahmadoo, who ruled to the north of the river, and has connected his territories with the coast by a chain of military posts. She is now at war with the Almamy Samadu, or Samory, who lays claim to vast regions in the interior on the southern affluents of the river, extended southward to the frontiers of Liberia, eastward to the territory of his enemy Tieba, and westward to the confines of the Rivières du Sud and Sierra Leone. Great Britain, on the other hand, has adopted the policy of advance by commercial enterprise. She has not attempted to compete with the military operations of her neighbour. The punitive expedition to Ashanti of 1873, necessary for the protection of the Gold Coast Colony, has been the sole exception to this pacific policy. Nevertheless, as the upshot of it, the British Government have made substantial progress. While guarding the stability of the old colonies, they have added to them the whole territory of the Oil Rivers, where by breaking down the restrictive system of the native middlemen, they have given an important impulse to trade, which is evidenced by the growing interest of the Chambers of Commerce; and the spirit and energy of the Royal Niger Company have, without the expenditure of Imperial funds, or the sacrifice of the life of a single British soldier, placed under the protection of the Crown, the whole of the Lower, a great portion of the Central, Niger, and its affluent, the Benue, up to Yola.

From want of energy France has been allowed to take the upper waters under its protection; and the result is that the Gambia colony has to be described as small and retrograding.

He would hesitate to put limits to the prosperity and importance of the place. Yet nothing has been effected at Lagos which could not have been accomplished in Gambia and Sierra Leone. The blame for the shortcomings to be discovered in British West Africa he does not attribute to British traders. The community engaged in conducting mercantile undertakings in West Africa he characterises as a set of genial, good-hearted Englishmen, sagacious and just in their dealings. Of the officials he also speaks in complimentary language. British West Africa has ceased to be a refuge for ruined spendthrifts, of whom their families rejoiced to rid themselves. West African Governors of the present type instruct the natives in the vegetable riches of their own land, and the acclimatisation of useful foreign plants, and they cultivate a fashion among their staffs of learning the native languages. In the past the lethargy which kept British West Africa back, and invited European competition, was universal. Public opinion at home is still far from being alive to the magnitude of the prospects in West Africa, and to the ignorance and inertness which threaten to mar and cloud them."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

A few minutes afterwards, Captain Keene, of the Benin, perceived flag signals displayed from the gunboats, which he understood to convey the order that he was not to communicate with the shore. Since the Benin had anchored no passengers had come out from either Rocktown or Cape Palmas, two ports about two miles apart, but a number of Krooboys, who were out in fishing and other canoes, boarded the mail steamer. However, in view of the orders flying from the Rocktown prohibiting communication with the shore, the Benin hove up anchor and put out to sea. As she was doing this a shot was sent from the Liberian gunboat, which struck the water a short distance from the Benin. Captain Keene did not think it wise to stay longer, but continued on his course, deciding to protest on his arrival home. The cause of the firing was not known by Captain Keene. If it was in any way connected with the Natives who boarded the Benin from the canoes, surely the gunboats should have stationed themselves off Rocktown or Cape Palmas and prevented the men leaving the shore before the Benin came up.

From Sierra Leone we have complaints that by the appropriation of the hinterlands British authority is confined to a narrow strip of coast; that French authority compels tribes outside our control to boycott our markets and to favour those of France. One effect is that natives are moving inside the British lines. The aggression assumes a most active form on the borders of our old colony on the Gambia. The Governor has investigated the circumstances attending the hauling-down of the Union Jack at two stations in the interior. In one case it was found that the district was distinctly under British protection; the other was about ""forty yards outside the British limit.""

The cablegram says the Governor was stopped by the French and Konnohs at Coongeah, or Loongeah, and that they threatened to kill him. The Governor in question is Colonel F. Cardew, who sailed from Liverpool on February 28 last to take up the administration of the Sierra Leone colony in succession to Sir Francis Fleming. Colonel Cardew appears to have lost no time in going into the interior. The Konnohs are the tribe that attempted to stop the advance of the West India Regiment under the command of the late Colonel Ellis, just prior to the deplorable French and English collision. The West Indians at that time drove the Konnohs before them from place to place, and it was then thought that they had received a lesson that would have lasted them for years. It is therefore feared that they have taken courage at some action of the French, although it is scarcely believed that the French would incite them to oppose the English Governor.

On the east we are similarly threatened by the Germans. They started with the possession of a small station at Beh, the people of which had long been desirous of entering the protectorate, but their offers were refused by the Government. This year a Commissioner was appointed to define the frontier. A line was decided on extending due north from the coast for a distance of over three miles into the interior. On this decision the Germans immediately annexed the Krepe country as far as the banks of the Volta. The Krepes were formerly in the Danish protectorate when we acquired Quittah and all the Danish possessions. Krepe went with the rest, yet we have allowed the Germans to annex the place. The sympathies of the natives are solely with the British. These German annexations are made by the advice and on the surveys of the Basle missionaries, who have for years been subsidised and protected by the British Government. For the rescue of some of their mission the Ashantee war was undertaken. The importance of these annexations will be seen when one has a knowledge of the trade routes to the interior, as it is upon the trade with the interior that the colony depends. There are three routes. The western is up the Tando River. A very large trade is carried on here, Ashanti being mainly supplied by this route. The command of the River Tando is lost if we permit the French to dispossess us of part of Apollonia and Aowin. The central route is via Cape Coast to Prahsu and Coomassie. A small trade is done here, owing to all the carriage being by land. This route is in British hands so far. The eastern, which will be the more important route, as by it most of the Mussulman trade is carried on, passes by the Volta through Krepe. Unless the Germans are dispossessed of this country, no British trade will be done this way. I hope you will call the attention of your Society to the neglect of British interests by the Government, and to the need for instant action, or else the whole of the British trade in these parts will fall into the hands of other European Powers.

The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The changing balance of power', 'content': ""Similarly, most African leaders were very suspicious of European missionaries. Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...''

At another time, he would ally with Muslims against Catholics or Protestants or both depending on who he thought was dangerous to his rule. Thus, Mwanga was adept at the diplomatic game of divide and rule, a tactic which the colonizing powers were able to use so effectively in controlling Africa. When it was necessary, Mwanga resorted to a revival of some old tradition in an attempt to drive out all foreigners as happened in 1888.$^{30}$ On this occasion, he intended to entice all foreigners and their Baganda followers to a naval parade on an island on Lake Victoria. There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler. Later, however, in 1889, Mwanga managed to regain his throne only to be exiled to Kisimayu, as already indicated, in 1899, where he died in 1903."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Models of African initiatives and reactions', 'content': ""War-weariness and insecurity contributed greatly to the acceptance of British wardship or alliance on the part of several African polities and individuals.

On account of the contractual inferiority of the peasant, and the usual concentration of three com› mercial functions in the hands of single individuals (purchaser of produce, supplier of credit and vendor of consumption goods), any surpluses developed by the little economy tend to be transferred to the middleman rather than remain available for reinvestment. 77 In settler-dominated areas, for example Southern Rhodesia, it 'became customary for European landowners to market their tenants' produce, and often that of neighbouring peasants as well',$^{78}$ a practice which minimized African competition and assured the settler of a semi-monopolistic position."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""In theory such indirect administration also applied to French colonial activities south of the Sahara, but in fact practice was at severe variance with it.

In some cases the dominant class emerged stronger as a result of economic and military ties to the slave-traders. Consider relations between the Bemba rulers and the Arab and Swahili traders. Under the leadership of Chileshe Chipela the Bemba had just completed a phase of territorial expansion and political centralization when the foreign traders entered their homeland around i860. As a result, the Bemba kingdom was far more unified and powerful than most states in the region. The geographical position of the Bemba, somewhat removed from the principal trade routes, precluded the growth of a large and potentially seditious merchant community within the core of their kingdom. Equally important, there was no incentive for the Arab and Swahili traders to adopt a hostile posture since the Bemba were not economic rivals. Most of the royal families' wealth came from raiding and tribute in the form of ivory and slaves and they were happy to exchange them for the cloth and other imported goods provided by the coastal merchants. This economic complementarity fostered a harmonious relationship and simultaneously enhanced the internal position of the Bemba aristocracy, which used the foreign commodities to recruit new followers and strengthen their links to subordinate chiefs. The continued demand for captives and ivory also fuelled a new expansionist phase from i860 to 1880, during which Bemba forces conquered most of contemporary north-eastern Zambia. Thus, through ties to foreign merchants, the Bemba rulers gained unprecedented regional power while accumulating a substantial amount of wealth. 43 As in the case of the Bemba, other local chiefs and merchants entered into alliances with the slave-traders that proved extremely beneficial. Throughout the 1870s the Chewa chief, Mwase Kasungu, whose territory straddled the Lake Malawi-Katanga trade route, provided food for the Arab caravans in exchange for guns.

The mission of these Envoys marks a stage in a series of negotiations. They are six in number, the chief amongst them being Prince A. A. Ossoo-Ansah, a son of Prince Ansah, who, in 1874, after the Ashanti War and the deposition of King Coffee, visited England for the purpose of clearing himself of imputations as to disloyalty to England during that war, and of obtaining compensation for the destruction of his property by the enemy. Prince Ossoo Ansah is the only one of the six who can speak English, and is appointed to act as interpreter and spokesman. The purpose of the visit has been stated in telegraphic despatches, but some fuller information is now available. It seems that the relations of Great Britain towards Ashanti have, with the sanction of the French Government, assumed somewhat new features, as it has been recognised as falling within the British sphere of influence. With the increased assurance of protection thus afforded, British traders have extended their operations in the country, which is extremely fertile in general produce, and especially rich in gold. The Governor of Cape Coast Castle, Sir W. Brandford Griffith, has consequently been led to propose the extension of British authority in a more formal manner—the establishment of a British Resident at the capital, Coomassie (or Kumasi). This step having been taken, the next would naturally be the definite conversion of the country into a British Protectorate. But to this idea a considerable number of the Natives have expressed the most decided objection; and it is with the idea of expressing the popular feeling upon this point that these six ""ambassadors"" have been appointed with the intention that they should seek an interview with the Queen, and lay before her Majesty the reasons why such a course would be so unpopular among their people.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-05-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_05_1895#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'outlet is offered through the means of these stations on the Coast, and the opportunity they afford for reaching the Interior.

The political interest must also not be lost sight of. In the event of political troubles in the East, it is quite conceivable that England may have to revert to the old route round the Cape of Good Hope in order to communicate with her Eastern colonies; and then the possession of strong and prosperous settlements on the Western Coast of Africa would be of incalculable advantage to her. We say, without fear of contradiction, that the formation of a railway connecting our chief possessions on the Coast, and which would be available at certain points to tap the Interior, would confer a vast benefit upon Native and European alike. Hitherto in only too many cases the contact of these two classes with each other has had a most injurious effect upon both. It is said that no matter how industrious and intelligent a European may be at home, no sooner does he find himself in West Africa than he becomes thoroughly demoralized; while the Native readily develops a fancy for strong drink that soon renders him unfit for the serious business of life.

During the last decade, the Church, Scotch, and London Missionary Societies have shown themselves more enterprising on the east of Africa than on the west; and yet in the rivers of Western Africa there are better highways to the interior than the caravan route into the Galla and Wagogo countries.

It is a fact well within the knowledge of all interested in the welfare of the oldest British colony in Africa that for some years past the French, by means of treaties made with the chiefs of the Upper Niger and Western Soudan, have been gradually encroaching upon the hitherto not very well-defined boundaries of the Colony of Sierra Leone, with the result of gradually reducing the British sphere of influence, and at the same time narrowing the field from which the merchants and traders of that Colony draw their native produce, and in which, in return, they have been in the habit of finding a market for their imported goods. Rather more than two years ago, an agreement was concluded at Paris between our Government and that of France with regard to the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence in West Africa. The territories referred to in the agreement were Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast. It was provided that the two Governments should have the right of appointing special Commissions of Delimitation ""to trace upon the spot, wherever they may consider it necessary, the line of demarcation between the English and French possessions"" in conformity with the agreement. The work of determining the boundary line between Senegambia and Sierra Leone is now about to be begun, the British Commissioners having left Liverpool on Saturday last. For some time past British merchants interested in commerce with Sierra Leone have been apprehensive that their trade with the interior might be seriously interfered with, if not absolutely ruined, by a wrongful definition of the boundary. Our trade with Sierra Leone is mainly dependent upon the caravan traffic between the British port of Freetown and the upper portion of the Niger.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ENGLAND AND HER WEST AFRICAN COLONIES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Turning to the question of the political administration of the Colonies at the present time, he enumerated the different systems of government prevailing in the various British Colonies in Africa, and said that the great benefits derived by the Colonies from their annexation to England, whose constitutional monarchy was the most stable system of representative government to be found in the whole world, were conspicuous and great. England had extended to her West African dependencies the privileges of British legitimate trade and commerce, which was a powerful vehicle for the advancement of civilisation.\n\nBringing forward the commercial advancement of the West African Colonies, he said the question had often been asked, ""Do the Colonies pay?"" He could answer with an emphatic affirmative. In 1837 the total external trade of England with all the Colonies was £28,341,471; it was now nearly £300,000,000, thus showing an increase of about ten times. The British shipping in connexion with the Colonies in 1837 was 3,677,975 tons; in 1885 it was 56,611,075 tons. The English Customs returns reckoned the exports to the Colonies in 1837 at £11,283,363; and this had since risen to £54,545,553. Her Majesty\'s Colonies, he said, furnished more than a quarter of the whole world\'s annual supply of gold. He then referred to the commercial geography of the British African Colonies, gave the value of their exports and imports, and reviewed the trade generally. The construction of a railway to the interior of Africa from Lagos was a recent proposition and a new feature in the history of the West African Colonies. It was obvious that Africa was, or would be, the only continent open for the future expansion of British manufacture; in such a case the interior would play an important part. He maintained, with eminent authorities on the subject, that by native agency alone, under foreign supervision necessarily, could tropical Africa be gradually and definitely developed on any permanent basis, and that the negro should be educated industrially and otherwise with the generous help of Europe and America. Whatever was accomplished by native agency, England certainly should carry the credit of effecting such accomplishment in the civilisation of Africa. It was beyond doubt that the English were acknowledged the best colonisers; and the marked consideration invariably shown by them to the people whom they undertook to govern, the extreme liberty and entire privileges of a British subject extended to every native, and the judicious caution characteristic of the policy of the British Government had altogether won for England this success and the preference to all other civilised nations.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills. Ivory has all but disappeared. Ebony and other woods are increasing in volume, and cocoa quickly rising into importance, as well as rubber.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The trade between this country and West Africa is capable of almost infinite development.

We are sure our readers will rejoice at this further step towards bringing West Africa into closer connexion with England. At present, the three weeks taken by even the fastest postal communication is a serious drawback to the commerce of Lagos, Sierra Leone, and the other West African ports, and the proposed cable will do much to simplify and develop commercial relations between Great Britain and the ports and towns in her West Coast possessions. Further south, we have the still more important district of the Congo. Mr. H. M. Stanley, than whom no greater authority upon the subject exists, seems never to tire of pointing out the advantages which must result from the formation of new markets in the Congo territory; and the decision of the European Powers at the Berlin Conference that Free Trade principles should be established at least for a term of years in the territory of the African International Association will do much towards the development of trade with parts not hitherto reached by commerce. The British Congo Company (Limited), the prospectus of which our readers will find in another column, which may be aptly described as the practical outcome of the Conference's decision, is now announced, with a capital of £500,000, divided into shares of £5 each. The Board of Directors contains many names well known in the African trade. Even under no very favourable circumstances a considerable trade has been for the past few years conducted between this country and the Congo. Last year, the imports into this district amounted to considerably over £880,000, and the exports to nearly £2,000,000—so that in round numbers the present trade may be roughly estimated at between two and a-half and three million pounds per annum. Though only just formed, the British Congo Company (Limited) will scarcely commence as an entirely new undertaking, for, in order to avoid the delays and disadvantages inseparable from an entirely new business, a provisional agreement has been made with the Congo and Central African Company (Limited), of Liverpool, which possesses several factories and stations along the river, and at Ambriz and Ambrizette on the coast, by which the Congo and Central African Company agrees to transfer its stations, factories, and buildings, stores and plant, its steamers, cargo, surf and other boats, to this Company at a valuation, to be paid for by fully paid-up shares in this Company, and to sell its stock of goods, merchandise, and produce to this Company at cost price. No payment will be made for goodwill, the shareholders in that Company being satisfied that they will make a larger profit by becoming interested in a more powerfully-constituted undertaking. This agreement will provide the new Company at once with a favourable basis for its operations, and enable it to enter immediately upon a profitable business in the Lower Congo district, and give great facilities for opening up trade as communications with the Upper Congo are established. Thus we are assured of a speedy increase of an already existing trade in the districts placed under the International African Association, and the British Congo Company (Limited), by possessing stations upon the coast as well as along the course of the river, will be well prepared to participate in the trade which is constantly developing among the peoples in the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A like change for the better has attended the reorganisation of our West African colonies, which, more or less, dates from the Ashanti War. In former times sufficient attention was not always given by the authorities to the suitability of candidates for employment in the minor posts in these then much despised West African possessions. But all this has greatly changed. The growing importance of the West African trade, and the general éclaircissement which followed the operations of the Ashanti War, have brought about a different spirit in the administration of these colonies, and the present colonial service in West Africa is not inferior to any other branch of the service in other parts of the world, and of late has furnished a considerable proportion of remarkable men who have distinguished themselves on the West Coast of Africa, and have been raised to posts of great influence and distinction elsewhere. I think, however, that decidedly more might be done to encourage such work as I have referred to in Lagos, namely, a thorough and scientific examination of the natural history and ethnology of these lands, so that we can be better guided in our administration of them, both by increasing our knowledge of their natural resources and by becoming more acquainted with the character of the races whom we are to rule. Especially should the learning of native languages be fostered among colonial officers. This movement has been already begun on the Gold Coast by Sir Brandford Griffith, and in Lagos by Captain Moloney, but I do not think any official steps have been taken in the matter. In nearly all the great divisions of Africa there is some lingua Franca—some widespread language of general use among native traders, or the ruling caste, which would be understood everywhere, from Benin to Old Calabar, and up the Niger to its confluence with the Benue; the Yoruba tongue, which is prevalent throughout Logos colony and right away to the kingdom of Nupe; the Hausa language, which is a good deal spoken in the Gold Coast colony, and which is one of the leading tongues of the Niger basin; the Mandingo, which is widely spread as a commercial language over the Sierra Leone colony; and the Wolof, which is much spoken on the Gambia. In the learning of each one of these languages in their respective spheres of influence colonial officers should be encouraged by small bounties or some palpable reward. These languages are simple in construction, and are illustrated by grammars and dictionaries published by the various missionary societies.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Commercial Value of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Altogether our West African possessions do a trade with Great Britain (mainly with Liverpool, London, and Bristol) of about £5,000,000 yearly, give honourable employment to some 770 of our British fellow-countrymen, and bring at least 5,000,000 of intelligent (Sierra Leone), sturdy (Krumen), industrious (Gold Coast), artistic (Yoruba), brave (Niger), good-tempered (Oil Rivers) negroes under our sway. I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain. If we gave away the Gold Coasts or Lagos, or the Niger, for instance, in exchange for concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or the North Atlantic, the ratio of loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be far greater than the gain to the Australians or the Newfoundlanders. To those who argue that our missionaries and merchants might go on working in West Africa just the same, even if the rule in our possession were transferred to another Power, I would ask, \'How many British merchants are there in French Senegambia? What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value.

Thereafter, up to about 1906, over 18000 New World Africans mostly aided by the ACS settled, annually, in Liberia in congeries of over thirty towns close to the Atlantic littoral on land obtained by the ACS or the Liberian government from the African chiefs of the region. Almost all of them were Afro-Americans, but at least 400 were Afro-West Indians from Barbados who emigrated in 1865 and settled together at Crozierville, 13 km inland from Monrovia. Over 5000 Recaptives - mostly from the Congo region - were also settled, particularly between 1844 and 1863, initially in the care of the Americo-Liberians as the New World African settlers and their descendants were collectively designated. 4\nNeeding land for farming, trade, and for building a great nation, and faced with some competition from the British and the French seeking land to build trading factories and military stations, the Americo-Liberians greatly expanded Liberia's territory from the few isolated points on the coast initially leased to them by African chiefs. By December 1875, when the expansion virtually ceased, Liberia allegedly stretched for 960 km along the Atlantic coast and between 320 and 400 km inland and hypothetically as far as the River Niger (see Fig. n.1). It embraced the Americo-Liberian and Recaptive settlements and peoples and the indigenous African ethnic groups and their territories.

The latter disputed that they had given up either their lands or their sovereignty, and also the black foreigners' aim of cutting down the main overseas commercial activity carried on in the area, namely the slave trade. The Reverend Jehudi Ashmun stood up to this opposition with 450 settlers, 200 of whom were liberated Africans.

A political charter was drawn up in the USA and administered by the local governor according to his own interpretation of it.

Throughout the nineteenth century, Americo-Liberians' policy was to assimilate the indigenous Africans culturally and politically by 'civilizing' and Christianizing them, and giving them equal rights with the settlers. Although this was achieved to some extent with the Recaptives (who were much less numerous than the settlers), the Americo-Liberians, mindful of their own privileged position, main› tained tight political control over Liberia by restricting political participa› tion of even those indigenous Africans who were educated. Only very few of them were given the franchise on an equal footing with the AmericoLiberians (although these might themselves be illiterate and poor). The main indigenous African representation (mostly of the coastal Africans) in the Liberian Legislature as from 1875 consisted of African chiefs designated 'referees' (or 'delegates'), after their chiefdoms had paid an annual 'delegate fee' of $100 to the Liberian government. As the delegates 'spoke' through an interpreter solely on ethnic matters and could not vote, they had very little influence on government policy.$^{8}$ Hence both the educated Africans and the chiefs resented their restricted representation. Furthermore the Liberian government sought to maximize its import and export duties and other levies on trade and shipping which constituted its main sources of revenue. To facilitate collection and control of the external trade by Americo-Liberian merchants, from 1839 the government restricted foreign merchants to trade at only six Americo-Liberian portsof-entry. The restrictions and levies alienated both the foreign merchants who resented them, and the indigenous African chiefs who had formerly controlled the external trade and levied the dues. Often, the foreign merchants and chiefs combined to resist or defy the trade restrictions and levies, or to appeal to European states to intervene on their behalf. Thus, at various times during the nineteenth century, the Vai, Kru and Grebo of the Liberian coast put up an armed resistance to Liberian government impositions on their trade. 9"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.711, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Back-to-Africa movements', 'content': ""Despite a discernible shift in black sentiment away from Liberian emigra› tion apparent among North American blacks during the first half of the nineteenth century, Afro-Americans continued to display an interest in African emigration in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

Similarly, widespread interaction between Africans and American blacks occurred because of the return of thousands of Brazilian blacks to West Africa until the time of the official abolition of slavery in Brazil (1888).

The Society would sell shares or land rights offered by African petitioners but only to Afro-American or African purchasers. 4 Bishop Turner also later served as an adviser to the International Migration Society (IMS) of Alabama, which sent about 500 emigrants to Africa before it became defunct in 1900. Some of the 500 remained in Liberia; others returned to the United States. Those who remained fared reasonably well; evidently more than a few of them prospered. On the other hand, those who returned told horror stories of poor land, inadequate food and poor living conditions. These stories reduced the likelihood of any large-scale Afro-American emigration movement, even though prospects for blacks in the United States were declining from 1895 to 1900. Nevertheless, numerous Afro-Americans evidently continued to give serious consider› ation to African emigration, just as others in the United States and the Caribbean simply moved away from overt discriminatory practices into other regions near by.\nAfter the turn of the twentieth century, the back-to-Africa baton was picked up by others. For example, one Captain Dean, early in the twentieth century, hoped to engineer the settlement of American blacks in South Africa to fashion a powerful black state there. After the briefest sojourn meant to arrange for this settlement, however, white authorities expelled Dean from the Cape for what were termed 'provocative activities'. And in 1914, Chief Alfred C. Sam, a Gold Coast African, turned up in Oklahoma, persuaded about sixty black farmers that Africa offered them greater oppor› tunities and sailed with them to Saltpond in the Gold Coast. Finding Chief Sam's claims to be exaggerated and encountering restrictions from the Gold Coast officials which inhibited the entry of American immigrants, most of the Oklahomans eventually returned to the United States.

Firestone obtained from the Liberian government the right to lease for ninety-nine years up to one million acres in Liberia to grow and export rubber, and Liberia secured a loan of $5000000 from the Finance Corporation of America to develop infrastructure including roads, hospitals and schools, as well as to pay her debts.$^{48}$ The loan, which received United States government support, greatly increased the influence of Firestone and the United States in Liberia."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.719, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': 'European aggression on Liberian and Ethiopian territory, 1880-1914 > Liberia', 'content': ""Neither invited to, nor represented at, the Berlin Conference, Liberia at first refused to be bound by its decisions such as the principle of 'effective occupation' on the ground.

The occupation of such a country by them could only be justified by considerations of the most disinterested character. Yet in this unhealthy climate—to say nothing of their naval establishment there, which cost 1,000,000l. a-year—they maintained no less than four settlements, which were established in the first instance for the purpose of promoting the slave-trade, and kept up of late years for the purpose of suppressing it. They spent 200 years in inflicting moral and physical injury on the people, and the last fifty years they had spent in doing something like reparation to them. What he desired was to ascertain if these settlements were well ordered and well regulated, and if the objects they had in view were not rather obstructed than promoted by their maintenance. It was only last year that the House was filled with alarm and anxiety, and some of its members with grief and sorrow, because the Governor of one of these settlements had nearly run them into a third war with the Ashantees. The troops were only withdrawn in time to save them from utter destruction. They were told by the Governor that these wars occasioned a total suspension of the objects for which the settlement was made, for whenever a war took place the squadron had to be withdrawn, and that this country must be prepared to bear the whole brunt of the war in men and money, for his government was not a colony, but a protectorate. They were told the other night by the Colonial Secretary that Colonel Conran was making a military progress amongst the tribes for the purpose of a friendly intercourse with the interior. They were told that the residents of the Gold Coast considered that Colonel Conran understood their interests better than the civil governor, and that the Dutch Government of Elmina was unfriendly, and in alliance with our constant enemies, the Ashantees. The circumstances of a Government so situated could not too soon be inquired into. The settlement of Sierra Leone was the most important of all, and ought to be the centre of improvement. A very high authority said that the people here were the very pests of the neighbourhood, and were detested wherever they went. Their exports and imports were steadily declining. In the third settlement of Gambia the exports and imports were also declining. The natives were in a constant state of civil war, and it was difficult, said the Governor, to avoid being mixed up with the troubles of our neighbours. With regard to Lagos, Governor Freeman said that the state of affairs there was going from bad to worse. Such was the state of these four colonies on the West Coast of Africa. The history of these settlements was as follows: The Gold Coast was first occupied by the Portuguese, and afterwards by the Dutch. It came into our possession in 1672. It was first placed under the parliamentary power of the African Company, and it remained in their hands till 1821. The Crown then assumed the government, and it had hardly done so before we were plunged into two Ashantee wars. In 1827 the Crown handed over the government of the Gold Coast to a company of merchants, and they were subsidised by a payment of 4,000l. a-year. He ought to have mentioned that the African Company were subsidised by a payment of from 13,000l. to 20,000l. for the distinct purpose of carrying on the slave-trade. The company of merchants remained in possession of the government till 1843, when their administration was found so inadequate, that the Crown was forced to resume the government, and there it remained till the present day. Sierra Leone was ceded to this country in 1787, for the purpose of emigration of free labour. A very large territory was annexed to the settlement, and this was a feature which characterised all their settlements. The settlement of Gambia was founded in 1816, and it continued under a committee of merchants till 1810. The settlement of Lagos was made in 1852, for the suppression of the slave-trade. In addition to these settlements, he might mention that the free Republic of Liberia was established by the United States of America for the purpose of encouraging free emigration from America, and it afforded the most safe barrier against the export of slaves from Africa. (Hear.) The maintenance of the settlements not only implicated us in the quarrel of chiefs along the frontier, but inevitably tended towards extension and increase. To be at all effectual for the purpose of suppressing the slave-trade, the settlements should necessarily be extended along the coast, for how, he asked, could the export of slaves be prevented when a portion only of the coast could be acted upon. Upon the subject of extensions he would quote the opinion of an officer who, twelve years ago, was employed to take possession of the island of Lagos. His view was that settlements had an inevitable tendency to extension; and that a great mistake had been made in the acquirement of territory around...'}, {'id': 3900, 'article_title': 'Contemplated Extension of Liberia in the Interior', 'full_section_title': 'Contemplated Extension of Liberia in the Interior', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1879#article-4', 'issue_date': '01_12_1879', 'content': 'Not only will the accomplishment of this object greatly add to the population, wealth, and political strength of the republic, but will bring us in contact with the healthy interior, where horses thrive in abundance, and cattle are innumerable.

The liberated slave represented the best elements of the negro population of his day. At the same time, in America, there was no place for him. He could not enjoy the privileges of a white man, he had lost the legal protection of his master; he was in fact neither slave nor free. It was to meet his wants that the Liberian enterprise was organised. None but liberated slaves were, at first, permitted to take part in it. Many of them were well educated and possessed advantages which might have made life in America more attractive than the hardships and dangers of a colonising experiment. White men were in the first instance excluded from citizenship in the new colony, and for many years Liberia was simply what it professed to be—a community of negroes, who sought in Africa the enjoyment of a freedom that could be only nominal in America.\n\nNotwithstanding the care taken the first band of settlers had to fight for their existence and owed the victory which established them upon the coast to the aid of an English man-of-war. Thus England saved the life of the young colony, and in the sequel the bond then established between them has never been forgotten on either side. In 1824 the town which the settlers had raised received the name of Monrovia bestowed upon it in honour of the then President of the United States. At the same time the social condition of the colonists gave the name of Liberia to their settlement. The colony flourished, agriculture was developed; a policy of trade with the natives and road and bridge making was inaugurated with much success, and in 1828 a charter of government which contained the germ of a more elaborate constitution was issued by the Colonisation Society. From the beginning the principle of self-government was recognised in a liberal manner. The agent and vice-agent alone were nominated by the Society, all subordinate officers were elected by the Colony, but the vote was restricted to landowners. The ""Maryland Colonisation Society"" had established another community on the same coast, in which the sale of intoxicating liquors was entirely forbidden. To these in 1833 and 1835 was added a Quaker colony from Pennsylvania, under whose auspices a detachment of artisans came to form part of the population of the State. The new arrivals settled in Grand Bassa, and in 1839 Liberia was divided into two counties, Montserrado, containing the capital, and Grand Bassa.

It is no doubt the large stretch of seaboard on the Gulf of Guinea that belongs to Liberia, more than its trade, that is making the teeth of the French to water. But, however this may be, the Liberians seem to have good cause to fear the French colonising officers that have been planted on their territory. President Cleveland and Secretary Graham have now the appeal of the Liberians under consideration; and if America is to have an outlet for the emigration of their blacks, we can scarcely doubt what the answer will be.

The first independent civilized African State on the West Coast, she occupies a position of great honour and usefulness. With institutions framed on the model of those of the United States of America, she stands out boldly before the world asserting and proving that there is no lack of natural ability in the civilized African to work the machinery of free institutions. Her President, her judges, her learned professors, are Christian Africans; no white man holds any political position in the country; the nation is essentially negro, and is so far from feeling any need of European or American aid in carrying on the various departments of her government, that she does more than discourage, she prohibits the permanent settlement of white men within her borders. They may come there for purposes of trade, but they are not permitted to acquire landed property; African she is, and exclusively African she is determined to remain. The enemies and libellers of the African race not unfrequently point to Liberia with contempt and ridicule, because she has not obtained in infancy the development of manhood; because, having no capital but what has been created by the industry of her own people, she is not able to undertake those works of civilization which are so much needed for the rapid development of her great natural resources; because, amid the abundant elements of wealth existing in her rich tropical fertility, and with her capability of producing so many objects that Europe requires and is compelled to seek even at the opposite side of the world, her Government is poor, and her revenue insufficient, without constant patriotic self-denial on the part of her principal citizens, for the support of those establishments indispensable to a free Christian State, which includes within her borders a native heathen population more than twenty times exceeding in number the civilized population of which the State really consists. But so far from there being anything in her public condition to justify contempt and ridicule such as our ignorantly-learned anthropologists would heap upon her and her people, every impartial man will find cause in her for wonder and felicitation that a mere handful of people brought to the African Coast from the degrading servitude of the late Slave States of the great American Republic should have fallen into so few errors, and have made such rapid progress. For it must be especially borne in mind that no comparison between Liberia and an English colony would be fair. An English colony, however small the number of emigrants and their descendants may be, is constantly and from its very birth receiving assistance from realized British capital. But the African emigrants from the United States to Liberia have not had any such resources at their back. They or their fathers have been slaves; and their only means of reaching Liberia was by the gift of a free passage, with six months free support after arrival, by the Colonization Society which founded this refuge for emancipated slaves on the West Coast of Africa. There have been no African Crusoes to help to build up this African Republic; the wealth, whatever it may be, within her is only the surplus of what her own people have created, over and above what they required for their own support. The progress thus made must necessarily be slow in comparison with that of an English colony anywhere, although it may be, as it has been in reality, rapid when viewed only in connexion with the elements available for promoting it. But we hope and believe that the time is now approaching when that progress will be greatly stimulated. Liberia, formed of American Africans, strongly imbued with the Republican principles so extreme in the American people, is not likely to attract any new elements of wealth and population from any other country than that from which its present civilized population has been derived. Ardently desiring as we do to see a rapid advance in Liberia, we rejoiced when we foresaw, as an inevitable consequence of the civil war in the United States, an increased emigration of emancipated Africans from those states to Liberia. The extreme change in the position of the late slaves in America, who have been so suddenly elevated from a debasing bondage, from a condition in which they were estimated rather as beasts than as men, to the full privileges of citizenship, political as well as social, has, however, retarded that movement toward Africa which would otherwise have impelled large numbers of the emancipated to Liberia. Still, the desire to become citizens of an exclusively African Republic, and that in Africa, has been gradually spreading in America, and the Colonization Society, who sent a shipload of emigrants in November last, and another in May, will despatch their ship again in November next with a further addition of some 800 for the African Republic. From the published statements of the society we have reason to believe that 4,000 or 5,000 emigrants might have been sent to Liberia during the present year, instead of some 1,500, had the society been in possession of the requisite funds. We must express our hope that the Colonization Society will be able to obtain all the money it may require to realize the spontaneous desires of late American slaves to become Liberian citizens. It is only by a large increase in her civilized industrial population that Liberia can make rapid progress in production and wealth. She is limited to this source of increase by the elements of which she is composed, by the nature of her institutions, and the strong peculiarities of her people; and all who are desirous of seeing the West Coast countries and their peoples emerge from their barbarism and degradation and come within the sphere of Christian civilizing influences should assist the Colonization Society of the United States in conveying emigrants to Liberia.

Five hundred, perhaps, at the most. It lies far away from the routes pursued by tourists, and the busy world hears little and knows less of the independent negro State which nestles in a corner of the West African Coast and has been the scene of a series of experiments absolutely unique in history. It was from this part of the African coast that some attempt was to be made to develop the Dark Continent. Emancipated slaves from the United States, now citizens of a republic established by themselves in the land of their forefathers, were to be the torchbearers of civilisation and to carry the lamp of learning to their brethren in the interior. Such was the scheme of the large-hearted and liberal philanthropists who, early in the present century, founded the various colonisation societies in the United States with a view of enabling its negro population to found settlements on the West Coast of Africa. These settlements were gradually formed, and, after passing through a series of trials, eventually confederated. In 1822 the republic was declared, and in 1847 Liberia was recognised as an independent State by the sovereigns of Europe and the United States Government. From Washington the new State borrowed its constitution. Although she has enjoyed the advantage of having had at least three Presidents—E. Johnson, Russworm, and Roberts—of high character and executive ability, it would be untrue to say that the hopes of the founders of Liberia have been realised. On the contrary the Liberian Government seems to have entirely failed to win the confidence or even to gain the respect of the native kings and tribes within its supposed ""sphere of influence""; indeed, some of them resist all attempts to enforce authority within the ill-defined boundaries of the State. At the recent inauguration of the new President—the Hon. — Cheeseman—it was a matter of general satisfaction that a gunboat, ordered from a Keil dockyard, was on her way out from Germany. This boat is to be the foundation of the new Liberian Navy, and, strange to say, it is required, not for the defence of the State, but to coerce a British merchant who for three years has declined to pay customs duty on the ground that he receives no protection from Government, that there is no civilised administration in the district in which he resides, and that he is compelled to employ and pay a police force of his own. The Government, urged by German merchants to suppress their independent competitor, has signified its intention of resorting to force, and will probably find itself in a difficulty with our Foreign Office if a single shot is fired on an English factory whose owner is considered to have made out a good case for non-payment of duty. The attempts of Christian missionaries to evangelise the Western districts of Africa have been discouraging. From the year 1481, when some priests from Rome unsuccessfully endeavoured to withstand the climate, the history of Christian labour is one continuous narrative of a futile struggle against disease and death. Protestant societies in the United States have literally poured dollars by thousands into Liberia. Some good work is being done by white ministers who have formed thriving settlements up the country (where the land is fertile and the climate healthy), and have urged upon the natives the importance of cultivating rice, corn, potatoes, ginger, sugar, coffee, and arrowroot, all of which are remunerative crops. As for cotton, indigo, pepper, pineapples, and gumtrees, they grow wild, and the superior knowledge of the missionaries has enabled the natives to gather them profitably. But Christian workers have to reckon with a foe more stubborn than Paganism. Islam is gradually winning its way towards the West Coast from the interior. The sword, it is true, goes hand in hand with the green banner, but the African negro is a ready convert. He finds the precepts of the Prophet easy to understand, and the sanction of polygamy is in entire accord with his present practice. Moreover, where Mahomet gains ground, intemperance—which unhappily follows Christian missions—disappears. I have said that Liberia is fertile. It is certainly the richest district in West Africa, but it is terribly neglected, and can never thrive under its present administration. There is practically no Government. The rule of the negro is marked by selfishness and corruption. The colonisation societies in the United States have almost abandoned in despair sending out more emigrants who, on landing, finding themselves free from control, quickly become lazy and wholly useless as pioneers for opening up fresh country. It must be confessed, therefore, that, after a trial of seventy years, the American negroes have failed to erect a State worthy of the name. They have lost what little credit they had twenty years ago—not even the interest is paid on the loan of 500,000 dols. raised in London in 1870—and Liberia is gradually drifting into the hands of a few wide-awake German merchants, who are understood to have made advances to Government against valuable securities, as well as to have exerted sufficient influence in Berlin to induce General Caprivi to protest in vigorous language against the concession known as the ""indiarubber monopoly,"" granted by President Johnson to an English syndicate of company promoters under circumstances which have been severely criticised. Lord Salisbury was aware of the facts, but it yet remains to be seen whether the British Government will raise its voice against a German protectorate of Liberia.—""E.

A party of four of these negro emigrants passed through Liverpool recently. They were en route for Liberia, having arrived from New York by the Cunard steamer Aurania. They were from the southern portion of Illinois, and they were going to Grand Bassam, Liberia. When questioned as to their object, one of the party, who acted as spokesman, said: ""Three of us are free slaves, including this lady.

It is governed the same as the United States. There is a President and Congress. We also want to get among our own people, for, although we are free in the United States, we have great obstacles to contend with by the white people offering trade opposition to us and trying to put other impediments in our way.

Jones, of Elder, Dempster & Co., and upon the receipt of it the Liberian Government give an allotment of 25 acres of land to each male adult.

Their self-government has been sneered at, but it is wonderful that people without any experience should have done as well as they have. Commercial morality is not at a high standard, and more might be done in cultivation and improvement of the fertile country which is under the Liberian flag; and the Liberians would be wise if they did not insist upon negro blood being present in the veins of all their citizens. But many of the faults we see are faults of ignorance, and others arise from the bad example of whites. The coffee plantations of Liberia might be increased almost to an infinite extent, and through Liberia there should be opened up a route to the interior which would bring a large trade to the coast. Between Liberia and the French possession at Grand Bassam, on the frontier of the Gold Coast Colony, lies a long strip of coast inhabited principally by Kroomen, who trade with Bristol ships, but who will tell nothing of the interior; and hitherto the trade has been carried on by sailing ships from Bristol, which cruise up and down the coast.

President Roberts, who undertook a tour through Europe for the purpose of obtaining the recognition of the Powers, was well received in England, and was not only able to conclude a commercial treaty, but was accepted as an ally in the prosecution of the campaign against the slave trade on the West African coast, and was presented with a gunboat to enable him to carry on the repression of the traffic in Liberian waters. He, in 1849, took an active part in an expedition of the Powers against the slade traders, who had their headquarters in the northern territory lying between Liberia and Sierra Leone. It was felt that if the whole coast could be held under anti-slavery supervision the trade might be extirpated, and in 1850 the West Coast territory to Cape Turner was purchased from the owners and placed under the guardianship of Liberia. Robertsport was founded this year, and commemorates the name of the President. The population of the Republic was rapidly increasing, her territory was extended towards the interior by treaties with the chiefs, and in 1857 the colony of Maryland was by its own request annexed.

The restriction by which white men were forbidden to hold land was also removed. Towns were multiplied and exploration of the interior began to attract attention.

Your figures with reference to the export of coffee into the United States have been carefully scanned.

Yet when the facts of the culture being in its infancy and of there being no banks nor other financial institutions to assist the growers, and no machinery, except in a few instances, are considered, I am of the opinion that our cultivators have made a tolerable good showing in foreign markets. The total product for 1887 was about 1,200,000 lbs., which are distributed as follows: to Germany, 606,000 lbs.; United States, 301,000 lbs.; Belgium, France, and England, 149,000 lbs.; Holland and 150,000 lbs.""\n\nBishop William Taylor, in his Quadrennial Report, states: ""The productive interests of Liberia are fairly prosperous.

For years a popular feeling in favour of emancipation has been growing; but now the government has suddenly moved in the matter and the glorious deed is done.

It has attempted to trade upon the supposed philanthropy of its rival, and it is likely to suffer in consequence. If Liberia does lose her northern territories, it is to be hoped that her statesmen will take to heart the lesson that from the day she declared her independence she was expected to have learned: that the era of philanthropy for her was over. She was to fight her own battles, look out for her own interests, stand up for her own rights. Failing to do this, she would suffer the consequences. Now in all the controversy about our North-west boundary we have blindly followed the path traced out by the English Government. We have done nothing that it was thought would offend. Their traders went into Mannah country. We enforced the laws they had ignored, were threatened with chastisement, paid an indemnity, saying we should protest, which we never formally did, and now we are told that we never protested—therefore it is an admission against us. Previous to the time of the Sulymah meeting, the English sent agents into the territory to collect evidence adverse to us, and paid for such evidence. We, although we had strong backers in the disputed territories, never made an effort to look after our interests and strengthen our case. Nor did we raise a single objection to the proceedings of the English Colonial Government. It might displease them; they would do right. Well, they have done right. They have cooked up a spurious claim made by a lot of exceedingly doubtful character, purporting to have been sworn in before magistrates influenced by traders known to be anxious for the acquisition of the country by Great Britain; and now they say, ""This is good claim; we must believe our citizens and our magistrates in preference to yours; give up the territory for the claim."" That the Cabinet was actually ready to fall in with the views of the English is heart-rending. Without animadversion, it certainly can be said with truth that they have disappointed the country. The protest transmitted by the citizens of Monrovia to the President truthfully points out the reason why we cannot accede without at least a struggle to the demands of the English Government.

European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome. Similarly, British peace› makers involved in resolving aspects of nineteenth-century Yoruba warfare had to travel virtually throughout the length and breadth of the culture area.\nUnfortunately, the European approach was divisive, tending towards politically structured differentiation. This was already noticeable in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era. British interests came to be specifically protected visà-vis the interest of other European nationals; British interests were also advanced against those of Africans.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible.

This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

In spite of the efforts of the abolitionist Consul Warrington, Britain was largely indifferent to the trade towards North Africa. In theory, all the participants in the trade, with the exception of Morocco, were under the control of the Turks of Constantinople. In practice, however, the provinces had long considered the suzerainty of the Kâramânlï to be of little conse› quence and tended to act independently. The French military conquest of the Regency of Algiers in 1830 turned into colonization from 1842 onwards, and the white settlers had little desire to employ slave labour. Caught between French and British pressures, the neighbouring Regency of Tunis abolished the trade between 1840 and 1842. Further east, the Regency of Tripoli had more obstacles to overcome because it had to obtain the consent of chieftains in the hinterland, some of whom were powerful middlemen in the trade in slaves from Borno or Sokoto. In 1842, Shaykh 'Abd alDjalil, who dominated the Fezzân from his stronghold at Murzuk, did agree to the abolition of the trade, but he was murdered.

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.728, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Political structures', 'content': ""This effort at self-development was perhaps most prominent in the realm of political structures and state power.

In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority.

He left Europe in the spring of that year, and landed at Zanzibar. Here he heard of the death of Captain Raymaeckers, who had been provisionally entrusted with the station to which he was destined, and the news determined him to hurry with all the speed he could command to the vacant post. He succeeded, according to the account he has given to the Brussels paper, in accomplishing the journey in 90 days, although nobody had done it before in a shorter period than from four to five months. He at once set to work, and, not content with developing the settlement of which he had undertaken the charge, he proceeded to found a new one called Mpala, the terrestrial Paradise of his tale. Mpala is situated on the western side of the big lake, Karema being on the eastern. Like all pioneers of civilization, the Captain found that he had uphill work before him. Difficulties arose with the natives, who, unaccustomed to the presence of white men, were disposed to resent their operations. There were several chiefs, particularly Lusinga, who took umbrage at the protectorate exercised by the International Association over the friendly tribes which had submitted to its rule, and whom it was necessary to bring to reason. One would have liked to hear how that process was accomplished, since European explorers in Africa have different methods of action, some of which would at least not commend themselves to societies for the protection of aborigines. The process was accomplished, however, in some way or other, and before Captain Storms had left he had not only induced the refractory tribes to lend him their assistance in his various enterprises, but had imposed upon them the payment of _hongo_, the tribute to a sovereign power which, in the interior of Africa, marks a condition of vassalage. He, moreover, succeeded in putting an end to the incursions of Arab slave-hunters, who had previously ravaged the country, as they ravaged the neighbourhood of Stanley Falls, before the appearance of the English traveller on the scene. Some months ago the managers of the International Association came to the conclusion that it would be wise to abandon for a time their position on the Tanganyika. The whole country between Stanley Falls and the lake was recognized by the Conference of Berlin as belonging to the Congo State, but it was thought that the stations of Karema and Mpala were too distant from the last link of its chain of posts on the Upper Congo to be effectively occupied at present. Hence the return of Captain Storms from the scene of his labours. He desires it to be understood, however, that the abandonment is by no means final. On the contrary, the Captain has left all his stores behind him, and the two stations are at present in the hands of missionaries sent from Algeria by Cardinal Lavigerie, who are exercising a temporary guardianship till it shall suit the policy of the Association to reclaim them.'}]","[{'document_title': 'THE ANTI-SLAVERY CONFERENCE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Anti-Slavery Conference has now practically concluded its labours. Its sittings began on November 18, and if the duration of the Conference has been protracted, the work done has been surrounded by difficulties, and the result is of great importance. To understand the scope and bearing of its labours it is necessary to give some few particulars of its objects and origin.\n\nThe opening up of the African continent to European enterprise and civilisation had recalled faults committed of old in similar movements where the unregulated advance of Europeans had led to the moral degradation of the natives and to lowering the standard of conduct among Europeans themselves. The reports, too, of Mr. Stanley and other explorers has roused public opinion and forced Governments to consider the means of co-operating against the Arab slave-raiders. Lastly, the whole coast-line having now been marked out as within the sphere of influence of one Power or another, it had become possible to cut the communication between the places of origin of the slave-trade and the markets for which the raiders destined their captives.\n\nThis was felt in 1885 at the Berlin Conference, where the British Plenipotentiaries brought forward a resolution in favour of joint action in a department of the question which until then it had been impossible to deal with. An article of the Berlin General Act had provided that—""All the Powers exercising rights of sovereignty or any influence in the territories in question undertake to watch over the preservation of the native races, and the improvement of their moral and material conditions of existence, and to co-operate in the suppression of slavery, and especially in the negro traffic; they will protect and favour, without distinction of nationalities or worship, all religious, scientific, or charitable institutions and undertakings, created and organised for this object, or tending to instruct the natives and make them understand and appreciate the advantages of civilisation.""\n\nAt the suggestion of the British Plenipotentiaries a special article was added to extend the international obligation of acting against the slave-trade, not only at sea, but also on land. This was Article 9, which provided that—""In accordance with the principles of the law of nations as recognised by the signatory Powers, the slave-trade being forbidden, and the operations which on land and on sea furnish slaves for the traffic also being considered as forbidden, the Powers which exercise or which shall exercise rights of sovereignty or any influence in the territories forming the conventional basin of the Congo, declare that these territories cannot serve either as a market or as a means of transit of slaves, of whatsoever race they may be.

Before we had anything to do directly with the government of India, or any colonies in Africa, there was an immense trade, and healthy and vigorous, which had been going on for ages between East Africa and India. The early navigators tell that they found there considerable freedom, a certain amount of civilisation, and a very large amount of trade with India. A century after that the country had been for the greater part occupied by the Portuguese, in some part by Englishmen, and its commerce and prosperity had declined. Something had been done since then to revive a legitimate trade there, and there was a very considerable trade with other countries in Europe. That trade was capable of enormous development. The unhealthy districts were all on the coast. The interior was well-watered and healthy, and yet the inhabitants had been swept from it within living memory by the slave trade. Large regions had been depopulated, and that was the state in which it was now found. It was since we made ourselves masters of the Indian seas that the slave trade had grown to its present dimensions. It must now be put down. The meeting would, therefore, respectfully urge upon Her Majesty's Government to take steps for the prompt abrogation of those treaties, and to carry out in other respects the recommendations embodied in the report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons to secure an entire abolition of the slave trade in Eastern Africa.\n\nSir Thomas Buxton, who seconded the resolution, said the slave trade papers had from year to year contained a mass of information on the subject, furnished by captains and others, which left no doubt that a tremendous evil was going on; but at present there was little excuse for the ignorance that existed on the subject. Zanzibar was the port through which the trade was carried on. In many cases we had treated the native states of Zanzibar very much in the way we treated the native states of India. We had interfered in their political affairs and their internal arrangements. That and other circumstances showed we had a certain authority in that port and in the islands about it, and if that evil of the slave trade continued, the world would hold us responsible for it in a great degree."", 'last_edit_date': '1872-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1872#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Next to that—though, perhaps, hardly second in importance—is the publication of the final Act of the Brussels Conference. We have given this in as full form as our space will allow in another column, and we only refer to it here to point out its general bearings and the effect it is likely to have in the future. No one can read the account without seeing that the Conference has made an honest effort to deal in an effectual manner with the evil of slavery. The maritime measures to be adopted offered some difficulty, on account of the refusal of France to concede the right of search, but she displayed the greatest readiness to secure the end in view by other measures. A scheme was drawn up by the French plenipotentiaries and became the basis of the deliberations of the Maritime Committee. The measures to be adopted on land were more easily settled, though here the interference with slavery as a domestic institution involved some risk of wounding Turkish susceptibilities. But the purely domestic is the least objectionable form of slavery; the slave-trade is the thing to be attacked by civilised nations, who trust to the spread of Western ideas and the gradual substitution of contract to put an end to domestic slavery. The arrangements made by the Conference will greatly hasten this process; and meantime the slave-trade will be severely and effectually repressed. The whole of Africa will be brought under repressive regulations, which may be more firmly enforced in some districts than in others, but will nowhere be entirely neglected. Following the lines laid down by the Conference of Berlin, the Conference has taken a broad view of its mission. Regulation of the trade in strong drink and in firearms does not directly bear upon slavery, but it does intimately concern the protection and preservation of African races. In order to diminish the evils of indulgence in strong drink, the Conference has decided to forbid its importation into regions where it is at present unknown, and to discourage its use where a trade already exists, by imposing a duty. As the Congo Free State covers an enormous area, any attempt to check the import of strong drink while leaving open that channel for its distribution would be simply useless. But by its constitution the Congo Free State guarantees perfect freedom of trade throughout its territories. We are sorry to see that Holland takes its stand upon this clause in the international agreement by which the Congo State is regulated, and refuses to countenance any relaxation. Because it is feared that this refusal of the Dutch Government to co-operate with the other Powers may lead to the complete waste of the efforts made for the suppression of the slave-trade as well as of the liquor traffic. Meanwhile, it must be admitted on all hands that the Conference has done a great and important work in preparing the way for the peaceful development of the native races.

Apart from local domestic slavery, which is slavery in its least objectionable form, there are two branches of slave-holding that must be considered. The slave holders of the present day are either subjects of those Mahometan Governments which are by courtesy described as civilised, or they belong to the Mahometan tribes of uncivilised Africa, which also supply the slave hunters. Upon the Mahometan people a two-fold influence can be brought to bear. In the first place, the closing of the seas to the trade will put a stop to the supply of slaves; and secondly, the influence of civilised opinion may in time modify their traditional system. It is doubtful, however, whether the clearing of the seas will close all the markets of the slave hunters. In all probability there is a considerable demand in the region between the Nile, the Niger, and the Congo, which it is not possible for Europe to check under present circumstances.\n\nThe disappearance of slavery from the world implies as a precedent condition the reign of law in Africa. It implies the subjugation of the whole continent by European civilisation. There is no reason to take a gloomy view of the future, but there is also no wisdom in shutting our eyes to the nature of the issue involved. Mr. Buxton's resolution will be of immense service if it helps to expose the true nature of the recent attitude of Europe towards the peoples of the Dark Continent. There is little doubt that the responsibility which European nations have now assumed in respect to Africa and the present desolations are related to one another as cause and effect. The recent scramble for Africa has done infinite harm. The flags of European nations have been floated over vast areas where there is no orderly administration of law; and the result has been to undo the work of a generation of heroes, and to bring back chaos where order was beginning.

The writer very forcibly demonstrates that even the best-intentioned measures against the traffic in slaves must fail so long as its great provocative, slavery, exists. Sir Bartle Frere and other equally distinguished modern advocates of the abolition of the slave trade, have been driven by their own experience to advance the same view; and the chief purpose of Mr. Cooper\'s book is to submit—which we think he does conclusively—that, were our Government to take up the question in earnest, the task of inducing Mohammedan Powers to abolish slavery would prove less difficult than is alleged.\n\n""The principal countries on behalf of which the present African slave trade is carried on are Turkey, Egypt, Persia, Tunis, Morocco, and Madagascar.

The rulers of these countries have in nearly every instance, at one time or other, condemned both slavery and the slave trade, and have entered into treaty engagements for the suppression of the slave-markets throughout their dominions. How is it, then, that the slave trade is still carried on in those countries, in violation both of law and treaty engagements?

All these trading establishments are constructed mainly of corrugated iron, with iron framework, though the interior may be lined with timber. The houses are well built, well ventilated, and comfortably furnished, and have all the appearance of a bright, pleasant home. With every trading colony of any size—that is to say, where there are more than three or four trading houses—there is a medical officer, jointly paid by the various firms.\n\nPerhaps in no body of Englishmen abroad has such an improvement taken place as in the class of men who now conduct the trade with the natives in West Africa. In former times we had the unscrupulous scoundrels and pirates who carried on the slave trade between West Africa and America. To them succeeded the scarcely more polished ""palm oil ruffians""—the masters and crews of the sailing vessels which would anchor for about a year in some one of the Oil Rivers, fill up their ships with native produce, and then sail away again. The conduct of the masters and seamen of these trading vessels was often outrageous. The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment. With the missionaries it can be imagined how these ruffians came in conflict; and so angry were they at the prospect of the missionaries protecting their victims, or interfering with them, that they bribed and frightened the native chiefs, and used every effort to prevent the missionaries obtaining any hold on the country. The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

His purpose is threefold—to extend our acquaintance with and influence over the tracts of country about Lakes Tanganyika and Albert Nyanza, to scotch the serpent of slavery which is devastating districts once populous and prospering, and to promote British commerce. Commander Cameron is not the man to work at haphazard. He hopes shortly to undertake a tour of the chief cities of the kingdom to engage for this scheme the approbation and support of all classes. He has spent several days in Liverpool explaining to commercial men in that seaport the nature of his plans; and there he favoured a representative with an interview:—\n\n""Then perhaps you would give a brief outline of your project.""\n\n""It may be better first to mention what its object is."" The Commander here turned up a map of Africa, and drew attention to the chain of lakes, which, commencing with Nyassa, works upwards to a somewhat ill-defined point north of the Equator. He puts his finger on several portions of the map which represented districts that when he passed through them were remarkably populous, but were now without inhabitants, the people having been either butchered in hundreds or driven away wholesale for slave purposes.\n\n""Following that line of lakes and rivers, which extends for some 1,200 miles,"" continued Commander Cameron, ""you see occasional intervals of land. Now, it is upon the western side of that line that the slave-dealers, speaking generally, find their happy hunting ground; and, to bring their wares to a market, they must cross either the lakes and rivers by boat or pass over the intervening stretches of land.

Lagos has for many years had a large trade carried on by British and other European merchants, yet this did not prevent it from being at the same time the head-quarters of slavery in the Bights. At Whydah an extensive trade in palm-oil has existed since 1849, and yet slaves have been regularly shipped from that port up to the present day, and, as has been already stated, a cargo was awaiting embarkation there in December last. Nor is this difficult to explain; palm-oil, which forms the principle article of trade, is collected by natives, chiefly domestic slaves, residing at or near the coast, its weight and bulk preventing it from being brought from a great distance in a country where there are no rivers; and it is evident that it would answer the chiefs better to turn their labour to account in this way than to sell them for exportation, even were not the customs of the country entirely opposed to such a proceeding. There is nothing, however, to prevent the chiefs from purchasing for export any number of the slaves captured in the hunts which are regularly undertaken for this purpose in certain parts of the interior, and so legitimate commerce and the slave-trade may be found combined in any spot on the coast to which British authority or influence does not extend.\n\nThus the existence of the British settlements, and of the Republic of Liberia, has served to eradicate the slave-trade from all but one spot on the 1,500 miles of coast extending from the Gambia to Quittah; and the recent acquisition of Lagos may be said to have freed almost entirely from the curse the remainder of the coast; the two exceptions being the small spot between the Gambia and Sierra Leone, the case of which has already been referred to in the report on the latter colony, and a portion of the sea coast lying between Quittah and Lagos, immediately in the rear of which are the dominions of the notorious King of Dahomey.\n\nIt is well known that, from the peculiar circumstances of his country, this monarch is indebted for his wealth and the maintenance of his authority over his people almost exclusively to the slave-trade. Whydah, the chief seaport of his dominions, is, as it has always been, the principal place of export; and advantage is also taken, when the vigilance of the cruisers renders it necessary, of the independent towns of Great Popo, Aghway, and Little Popo, situated to the westward, the inhabitants of which are only too ready to afford every facility for a trade from which they derive such profit.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE OIL RIVERS, AND WEST AFRICAN CIVILIZATION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We do not think it is possible that anyone who has at heart the progress of civilization and Christianity in Africa can do other than deplore the very slow advance made in these among the natives of what are familiarly known as the Oil Rivers—palm-oil being their chief export. We say their export, because their palm-oil is not produced at Benin, Brass, Bonny, Opobo, Old and New Calabar, and Cameroons, but is procured from interior countries, and merely brought to the above-named places for sale and shipment. The natives of these oil-exporting towns go up with their slaves to the interior, carrying manufactured goods, gunpowder, rum, and other desired commodities, which they there exchange with the interior people for oil, to be brought down by themselves to the coast. They do not allow any intercourse of those interior producing people with the European merchants and traders, but reserve to themselves the entire monopoly of transactions with them. They have systematically opposed every effort of the European or even educated African merchant and trader to establish commercial or other relations with the interior. They seal this up, as it were, from the intrusion of civilization and Christianity, in order that they may preserve their monopoly of trade. In the same way that, previous to 1835, they monopolized the supply of slaves to the ships of the odious foreign slavetraders, so do they now monopolize all trade relations with the interior. Yet, these are not powerful or even large communities. At none of the places above-mentioned do they number more than a few thousands, chiefly slaves of a very limited number of kings, chiefs, and head men—the traders.

Another question which has to be overcome in the Upper Congo is the difficulty and cost of transport between Vivi and Stanley Pool. The American officers sent to report on the advantages to the trade of the United States to be expected from the opening up of the Congo, say that on this section there was famine and disease, and that even the employés of the International Association were suffering from these causes, and that transport was both scarce and costly.\n\nUntil some better route is opened up, the trade of the Upper Congo can only be tentatively opened, as it is doubtful if ivory even will be able to stand the great cost of carriage.

The Dutch are the largest traders in the Lower Congo, and the slave trade continued longer there than in any other place on the West Coast; and even after it was put a stop to, many of those who had been engaged in it remained, and brought into more legitimate trade the lawless habits they had acquired in their previous avocation; and the native inhabitants of the creeks and shores of the stream were lawless and fierce, and not unfrequently indulged in piracy.

L. Cameron, R.N., C.B. The Earl of Dundonald was in the chair.\n\nCommander Lovett Cameron, in the course of his opening remarks, said the slave trade went on all round the continent of Africa, and commerce had gone on with it. Our trade with the West Coast of Africa had gone on since the time of the Tudors. For centuries that trade was in slaves, and its increase was slow; but after several blows had been struck at that trade—among others by the liberation of slaves in the West Indian Islands, in America, and in Cuba—instead of their being any injury done to our commerce, our trade with the West Coast of Africa increased by leaps and bounds. It was only in 1850 or shortly after that we attacked a great nest of slave dealers in Lagos, and in 1861 it was made a British colony. Up to that time there had been no trade there except in slaves; but last year the trade of Lagos amounted to £357,831 imports, and £538,980 exports. And yet only thirty-eight years ago that place was of absolutely no value to us for legitimate commerce. On the Gold Coast slavery had been practically abolished by the British Government, but yet there was a good deal still existing owing to the native customs of the people. Even if the export of slaves from Africa was prevented entirely, the internal trade in them would still be enormous.\n\nFormerly the slave trade was subsidiary to the ivory trade, but when porters were no longer wanted for the latter, the former remained, only the men were killed and the women and children carried away. It had been said that domestic slavery must be allowed, and that was a very difficult question to settle. In his opinion, we should, as in India, abolish the legal status of slavery, but should not rout out all the households where no complaint was made. As long as domestic slavery existed there would be a market for slaves. We must have nothing to do with slavery; while the slave trade continued it was impossible for legitimate commerce to go on as it should! If the slave trade were done away with, they would find that all other trade would flourish.\n\nIn answer to questions Commander Lovett Cameron said he had avoided speaking of the Germans for diplomatic reasons.\n\nHe had a plan for the total abolition of slavery in Africa, which he hoped to explain shortly. It was, in brief, to establish a barricade across the country by the way of the lakes, and to get authority to maintain order on that line.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, on February 26, presided over a large meeting, held in Exeter Hall, when two African explorers, Commander Cameron and Captain Hore, were announced to speak.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-03-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_03_1889#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SLAVE-TRADE PRACTICES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""By the Mail arrived December 31, 1877, we learn that Mr. Acting-Consul Tait was in Lagos when the Mail left, prosecuting a slave-dealing case against a Sierra Leone young man from the River Niger.
