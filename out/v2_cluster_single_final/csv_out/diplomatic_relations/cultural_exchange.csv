41,The activities of the African-Aid Society and the experiences of Africans traveling to Europe highlight the diverse motivations and cultural exchanges between Europe and Africa during this period.,"The observations from both the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive understanding of the diverse motivations and cultural exchanges between Europe and Africa during this period. While the textbook does not specifically mention the African-Aid Society, it highlights various interactions, such as Africans traveling to Europe as free individuals, students, and sailors, which contributed to cultural exchanges and the spread of African influence in Europe. This underscores the educational and cultural motivations behind these exchanges, particularly in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Additionally, the text discusses the role of European missionaries and traders in Africa, illustrating the complex interplay of cultural, educational, and economic motivations. Complementing this, The African Times articles detail the African-Aid Society's activities, such as presenting gifts to African leaders and facilitating Christian civilization efforts, which demonstrate a motivation to influence and support African societies through cultural and religious means. The articles also highlight the experiences of Africans traveling to Europe, such as a native of the Gold Coast visiting Italy, and discuss the role of European commerce and missionary work in Africa, emphasizing both positive and negative impacts. The African-Aid Society's efforts to introduce skilled labor and industrial knowledge to Africa further illustrate the exchange of ideas and practices. However, the articles critique the superficial nature of some European philanthropic efforts and the detrimental effects of certain commercial activities, such as the slave and gin trades.

Indeed, Africans had been present in Western Europe from Classical Antiquity onwards, though the numbers only became substantial from about the fifteenth century on, when black Africans, first as slaves and then as freedmen, began to appear in southern Spain and Portugal, arriving at first by way of the trans-Saharan trade to North Africa. Then, as the direct maritime trade from Europe began to open in the second half of the century, still larger numbers of Africans appeared in Europe. 30 Many were slaves at first, especially in Portugal, the only significant slave-trading European power till nearly the middle of the seventeenth century. Over time, however, many found their way into the broader European society, though often at the bottom of the social hierarchy, since their social condition was assimilated to that of their fellow Africans who did most of the physical labour in the tropical colonies. Their legal status was also ambiguous. The law, in northern Europe generally, no longer recognized the status of slave, though European colonial laws did. From 1685, residence in France was held to confer freedom, and the same was true of England after the notable judicial decision of Lord Mansfield in 1772 already noted. In both situations, however, slaves from the colonies were still slaves de facto; in many instances until the European powers abolished slavery in the colonies themselves, in 1834 for Britain, 1848 for France, and 1888 for Brazil.\nIn spite of their ambiguous legal status, free Africans were present in Western Europe in considerable numbers from at least the mid-eighteenth century on. Estimates vary, but by 1800 they would have numbered several thousand in each of Spain, Portugal, France, or Britain; and in Spain or Portugal they would have been more numerous in an earlier period. The numbers were small in any case, compared with total European populations, but the African immigrants tended to be concentrated in the main cities, particularly in the port towns, so that their presence was more visible than their numbers would suggest.$^{31}$ It goes without saying that, for any period before the 1840s, far more people of tropical African descent would have been found in Europe than Europeans in tropical Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.74, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The diaspora in Europe', 'content': 'This community of Africans in Europe was also concentrated in certain occupations, especially domestic service, this being partly a carry-over from the occupational status of Africans who came by way of West Indian slavery, partly a reflection of the European fad for exotic servants. African sailors were also common by this time in the merchant service, though more so in Portugal than in France or Britain. Another significant, if smaller, group was made up of students, who began to arrive in Europe in significant numbers by the middle of the eighteenth century and, in increasing numbers, throughout the nineteenth century. In an era in which commercial contact between Europe and Africa was increasing, it was an obvious advantage to African traders to be literate in a Western language and to have some acquaintance with European accounting practices. Many of these students therefore came to Europe through the good offices of European slave-traders operating in Africa and studied under their care in the principal slave-trade ports like Liverpool or Nantes.\nStill another peculiarity of the African communities in Europe was the fact that they were overwhelmingly male. This fact had two important implications. The African community was not self-sustaining. It had to be, and was, constantly replenished from overseas. This is not to say that the Africans had no sexual relations with European women, but the products of these relationships tended to be culturally European rather than African. After a few generations, the African physical appearance tended to disappear into the general European genetic pool.\nSome Africans also found their way into Eastern Europe, in spite of a more attenuated maritime contact with tropical Africa itself. There, the main line of entry was by way of the Ottoman slave trade, which was not mainly a trade in North Africans, but included sub-Saharan Africans drawn across the Sahara to Ottoman-associated ports like Tripoli, or brought north down the Nile from what is now the southern Sudan.$^{32}$ In a few instances, small pockets of African culture persisted in parts of the Ottoman empire into the twentieth century, such as a small Hausa-speaking com› munity in what is now Yugoslavia.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.753, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Pan-Africanism: political and cultural aspects', 'content': ""While Garvey and Du Bois were stirring the black world politically during the first three decades of the twentieth century, a broadly influential Africa-oriented cultural efflorescence was taking place. The reaffirmation of black culture took hold in Europe, the Caribbean and West Africa, particularly, led by the French-language African and Caribbean students in Paris who were drawn into the Pan-African Congress movement, the programmes of the UNIA and the general excitement of the Harlem Renaissance.\nIn short, the interaction between Francophone Caribbean blacks (such as AimØ CØsaire of Martinique, whose famous poem Cahier d'un Retour au Pays Natal was published in 1939) and West African intellectuals (such as the Senegalese poet-politician Leopold Senghor) forged the nØgritude movement. Based on a belief in a common cultural heritage among all African and African-descended peoples, the nØgritude writers tried to re-link the spheres of the black world.\nThe concept oî nØgritude was strongly influenced by the black experience overseas, and by the writings and intellectual vigour of the Harlem Renaissance. In turn, the Renaissance movement was fuelled by a rising cultural identification with Africa. Countee Cullen wondered poetically 'What is Africa to Me?' in his poem called 'Heritage', while Langston Hughes in his poem 'The Negro Speaks of Rivers' mentions how he built his hut near the Congo and it lulled him to sleep.$^{63}$ Both greatly influenced Senghor and the nØgritude writers.\nBut it was another Jamaican, Claude McKay, whose poetry helped to unify cultural and political pan-Africanism, when he insisted through the vehicle of his poetry that blacks should acknowledge, and protest against their common suffering and assert their dignity. Particularly telling was a defiant McKay poem, later used without credit by Winston Churchill during the Battle of Britain, called 'If We Must Die'. McKay, like Garvey and thousands of African students, began his sojourn in the United States because of an interest in Tuskegee, but soon left and joined the millions of blacks who turned up in New York in the 1920s."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.\nThis flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours. This route also linked Yorubaland with Borgu, Hausaland, Borno and beyond.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Pan-Africanism: political and cultural aspects', 'content': ""In addition, a series of annual graduation exercises, called 'African Rhetoricals' were organized at Tuskegee to respond to specific African agenda needs such as the raising of funds to support a Tuskegee Chapel in Liberia. The exercises usually featured African and Afro-American students at the Institute in speech and song. In the exercises of 1916, speeches ranged from 'The Development of the Cocoa Industry on the Gold Coast', and the 'Possibilities of the Development of Agriculture in South Africa' by A. B. Xuma,$^{5}$ ' to 'Religion and Social Life in Madagascar'. Pan-Africanism as an organized political movement also became an important linkage between colonial Africans and American blacks. In 1900, Henry Sylvester Williams, a Trinidadian lawyer, organized in London the first of a series of pan-African conferences to which delegates went from the United States, the Caribbean, South America and Africa. Moreover, Williams, admitted as an 'advocate of the Supreme Court in the colony of the Cape of Good Hope' to practise law in South Africa from 1903-4, participated in various African political protest activities. Williams is also known to have become involved in the Diamond Jubilee Celebration of Liberian independence, when, at the behest of President Barclay, he took up in 1907 the cause of New World emigration to Liberia.\nUnquestionably, however, it was the three Pan-African Congresses, following Williams' conference, convened by W. E. B. Du Bois in various European capitals (Paris, 1919; London, Brussels and Paris, 1921; London and Lisbon, 1923) which dominated the organized pan-Africanist move› ment. Du Bois himself, in turn, dominated these next three Congresses. He convened the first in Paris in 1919, while in France to cover the Paris Peace Conference for The Crisis, to collect information for a proposed 'History of the American Negro in The Great War'; and to lobby for the political rights of 'the Darker races living within the U.S. as well as throughout the rest of the world'.$^{52}$ Among the resolutions adopted at the Paris Congress in 1919 was a resolution calling for self-determination for Africans."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': ""In discussing the growth of European interest in the area of West Africa under review, it is useful to distinguish between two phases: that of freedom of movement for the European powers involved up to 1861 when Lagos was annexed to the British Crown, and the succeeding era of international rivalry between France and Britain with Germany entering the competition in the 1880s. This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.\nIn the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium. Major Christian missionary bodies such as the Church Missionary Society (CMS) of the Church of England and the Lyons-based SociØtØ des Missions Africaines (SMA) of the Roman Catholic Church each employed a mix of European nationals. Father Boghero, who led the SMA in an effort to re› introduce Roman Catholic Christianity to West Africa in the nineteenth century, was an Italian. The pioneer SMA Fathers in most parts of the area which became Nigeria were French, just as it was such British missionaries as Thomas Birch Freeman of the Methodists and Samuel Ajayi Crowther of the CMS who pioneered the work of Christian missions in what was to become French Dahomey (present-day People's Republic of Benin).$^{33}$ British, French, German and Portuguese traders set up businesses adjacent to one another and, as the case of Badagry clearly demonstrated, there were residential quarters for diverse European nationals in the major ports all along the coast of the Bight of Benin.\nTraders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The diaspora and Africa', 'content': ""While Africans who came to the New World can be numbered in millions, their descendants who returned to Africa amounted to only a few thousands.$^{56}$ Many reasons account for this, not the least of which was the significant lack of support to establish the type of transportation system which had previously facilitated the westward trans-Atlantic flow. Repatri› ation during the nineteenth century offered few material rewards for Europeans or non-Europeans. But by 1900, the divergence between Africa and the Americas had become too great. Persons of African descent became caught up in the self-consciousness of the age which produced the type of xenophobic nationalism that all but destroyed the appeal of Africa. More› over, the interest in Africa after the end of the slave trade grew from national lusts for power and wealth - and Afro-Americans lacked both political power and the wealth needed to stimulate their own interest, or influence those who were partitioning Africa into colonial spheres. The Afro-American view became focused more on the new developments within their hemisphere. Internal and inter-regional migrations and the quest to establish the good life against new deleterious challenges absorbed their attention. The African connection faded, but did not die. The return-toAfrica movement found individual promoters who could occasionally infuse the movement with new appeal. In 1897, Henry Sylvester Williams, a Trinidadian-born lawyer living in London, founded the Pan-African Association, whose later membership would include George Padmore, Kwame Nkrumah and C. L. R. James. In the 1920s Marcus Garvey founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association, a movement designed to spur African decolonization and unite all Africans wherever they were found.

Delany, was continued and enlarged upon in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. In 1878, for example, the South Carolina-Liberian Exodus Joint Stock Steamship Company brought 206 black immigrants to Liberia. In 1881, Henry H.

Blyden, visited the United States from Liberia on behalf of the American Colonization Society (ACS) to help generate black support for emigration. Moreover, between 1880 and 1900, Bishop Henry NcNeal Turner laboured to combine the two traditions long dominant in the modern history of African/Afro-American interaction: African emigration and Christian evangelism. Similarly, widespread interaction between Africans and American blacks occurred because of the return of thousands of Brazilian blacks to West Africa until the time of the official abolition of slavery in Brazil (1888). Upon resettlement in or near their previous homes in Nigeria, Dahomey (now Benin), Togo and the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the Afro-Brazilians' technical and commercial competence and political aspirations seem to have broadly affected the social, economic and political conditions there.

Also, by 1892 black applications to the ACS for passage to Liberia had increased rapidly and several hundred black farmers from Arkansas and Oklahoma arrived in New York hoping to be transported to Africa. Moreover, in 1893, when he visited Liberia, Bishop Turner glowingly reported that 'one thing the Black man has here [in Liberia]... is Manhood, freedom; and the fullest liberty; he feels like a Lord and walks the same way'.$^{1}$ And again in 1896 he asserted: 'I believe two or three million of us should return to the land of our ancestors and establish our own nations, civilizations, laws, customs, style of manufacture ... and cease to be grumblers, chronic complainers and a menace to the white man's country he claims and is bound to dominate'.$^{2}$ Through Bishop Turner's efforts, over 300 Afro-Americans emigrated to Liberia in March 1896.

Only African populations of certain regions were initially involved in inter› action with American and Caribbean blacks. Those regions involved early in our period were the ones which became the focus of American black emigration or evangelism, particularly West Africa, South Africa, and the Horn. Peoples of other regions became involved because of the penetration of their region by pan-Africanist projects, American black writings, folk› lore, and the like, or more importantly, because of the initiatives of school leavers who went, in growing numbers from all over the African continent, to America for higher education.\nPerspectives were undoubtedly affected by direct and substantial inter› action of Africans within a particular black environment or set of influences. Exactly how much is anybody's guess. The effect of colonial African experience with American blacks appears, nevertheless, unique and vital in terms of subsequent social and political activities. For some, the American black component within African nationalist ideology and strategies emerging during the colonial period was striking and unequivocal. In the view of others, for example some African students, interactions within American black arenas were disappointing and unrewarding. The caustic assessment of one such visitor illustrates the latter point: 'One of the things I had decided to find out during my stay in America was the condition of the descendants of former slaves brought here from Africa ... I feel safe in saying that, so far as economic and material progress are concerned the Negro in America is on the average ahead of the West African, but when it comes to integrity and genuine manhood, the American Negro is far below him.' 75 Another view was that many Afro-American missionaries who viewed Africans as 'poor heathen savages' must bear some of the responsibility for perpetuating a distorted and pernicious picture of Africa and Africans in the minds of their fellow American blacks. In other words, in their sedulous campaign to recruit American black workers for foreign missions, missionary churches undoubtedly succumbed occasionally to the tempta- tion of portraying an exotic, erotic and socially inferior Africa much in need of great sacrifice, hard work, and alien redemption."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'Introduction', 'content': 'The remarkable mass migration of Africans to the Americas, the Middle East and Europe under the aegis of the trans-Atlantic and other branches of the slave trade constitutes one of the major events of African and world history.$^{1}$ This emigration, largely involuntary on the part of the participants, lasted for centuries, leaving residual communities of varying sizes scattered about in Europe, the Middle East and the Americas. 2', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.718, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Conclusions', 'content': 'In broad pan-Africanist terms, however, the evidence seems clear that African political and ideological visions were expanded and technical expertise was improved because of colonial African interactions with American blacks.

The themes of African redemption through American black missionaries were another.\nAfricans themselves, however, created the context of their next interaction with American blacks as they matriculated at American, largely Afro-American, schools and attended pan-African conferences and the like. Consequently, many Africans underwent a technical-educationalpolitical experience alien to their colonial world. When they re-entered their own worlds, many felt driven to resolve questions of ideology, cultural definition, educational values, political power, and pan-African unity or consciousness, guided by new perspectives.\nViewed against such an historical backdrop, the numerous pan-African conferences, Tuskegean educational and technical projects, the nØgritude movement and the occasional focus on American blacks in African millen› nial dreams, all illustrate the consistency of the pan-African theme among American and Caribbean blacks. They also show the variability of African responses to the New World overtures and ultimately the shaping by Africans themselves of these overtures to fit African specifications.\nIn sum, the populations of the African diaspora and the motive charac› terizing the many interactions between persons of the first and second black worlds included two visions. One was a vision of the union of religious forces among black populations in Africa and America or the reconstruction of Africa through importation of American and Antillean black technical expertise, initiated at the behest of American blacks. Another reflected the transformation of Africans from predicate to subject during the colonial period. The latter was a vision of the spiritual redemption, social recon› struction, and political reformation of African communities through the repatriation of African personnel and the energizing of African resources. Because of this vision, Africans had been educated in American schools, or sent to participate in technical and commercial activities; others were touched by American black writings or by anti-colonial ventures organized among blacks of the diaspora. This latter vision seemed not so much to discard as simply to vindicate and to reorientate to an African perspective the idealism implied in the earlier vision.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The impact of Africa', 'content': 'Where they could - and where they had no other recourse - Africans and Afro-Americans adjusted to the conditions in which they found them› selves. In a milieu of cultural symbiosis, Africans contributed almost as much to the rest of the society as they accepted from it. Of course, the more they needed and the less they found, the more they became creative as the patois speech pattern of the previously French eastern Caribbean islands and the papiamento of the previously Dutch Antilles reveal. Cre› ativity became especially necessary where a small number of Europeans lived among a large number of Africans as was the case in many colonies of exploitation such as Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Saint-Domingue. Where the European population failed to comprise a critical mass, the Africans had to build a society from a diverse collectivity of individuals who had little more in common than their skin colour and their servility. The adoption of their customs and behaviour by the non-African sector indicated the measure of their success.\nAfricans did not always conform to the society into which they were thrust. For centuries marronage, or the flight from the slave system, existed as an integral aspect of slavery.$^{53}$ In Brazil, the north-east witnessed the establishment of the quilombo of Palmares which lasted almost a century and which was eliminated only with the largest military force ever mounted in the Americas by the Portuguese and Brazilians. Maroon towns existed for equally long periods in Esmeraldas in Ecuador and in parts of the Blue Mountains and the Cockpit Country of Jamaica. Marronage manifested not only the wish to be free, it was an eloquent and visible condemnation of the system of slavery by Africans.\nBy the time African slavery was eliminated in the Americas, the position of the African sector had worsened dramatically from what it had been a century before. The political and economic reconstruction that followed the Civil War in the USA accompanied a movement of legal discrimination and social and economic exclusion of the non-white sector, characterized by segregated institutions, lynchings, and overtly racist societies and organ› izations, which combined until the middle of the twentieth century.$^{54}$ The general conditions experienced by black Americans then compared with those prevailing today in a more extreme way in South Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'Military conquest, 1885-1902 > Why were European powers able to conquer Africa?', 'content': 'European powers were able to conquer Africa with such relative ease because in virtually every respect the dice was so heavily loaded in their favour.

Since the Mediterranean world did not practise an extensive plantation economy, the volume of sub-Saharan Africans fed into the system remained relatively low, probably not exceed› ing several hundreds per year. Within the Ottoman empire large numbers of Africans were employed as soldiers and sailors, eunuchs, concubines, administrators and, in cases such as Abü'1-Misk Käfür of Egypt (d. 968), could even become the effective ruler of the state.

The very atmosphere was electric with the most wonderful schemes—religious, philanthropic, and commercial—for the exclusive benefit of the negro. From platform and pulpit rose a clamour of voices, in which was heard the popular watchwords of the day—civilisation, progress, the good of the negro, legitimate commerce, conversion of the heathen, and other high-sounding phrases, all having relation to the good things to be done for the African. The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation. They never heard now of the trader who went to Africa with the merely selfish object of making his fortune. Each and all became pioneers of civilisation, thinking only of the native first and self afterwards. They spoke as if the good to the native had been enormous, and that their intercourse with him had been a benefit and blessing. They pointed with pride to their sacrifices in the suppression of the slave trade, to their West Coast settlements as centres of secular light and leading; to their missionary stations as stars twinkling in the night of heathendom; to the returns of their trade with every entrance to the heart of Africa, as showing the spread of their beneficial influence. They saw that the work of other nations had been pernicious in the extreme, that they had been brutal in their dealings with native races, and had thought only of their own sordid interests and national aggrandisement—all in marked contrast to their aims and methods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Industrial Education in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Every month's experience justifies more and more the views of the African-Aid Society upon this question—views which they have only not carried into practical operation because, hitherto, there have been no funds for the work. To raise the industrial status of the African people, they must be taught those things which the civilised world has bit by bit acquired. Leave them to themselves, and they will never learn them. Why should they? They have not the same physical necessities that more northern people have. And physical necessity has been one of the great spurs to northern advancement. From a barbarism almost as degraded as that of the African, we have, under its impulse, gradually progressed to our present industrial, scientific, and social elevation. But there is no reason why the Africans should be condemned to a similar tortoise-like advance. The knowledge we have laboriously and tediously gained, in part from earlier civilizations, we could easily and rapidly impart, but it seems to have been almost the last thing thought of. In our anxiety to Christianise we have too much lost sight of the material aid that a spread of the arts, conveniences, and industrial facilities of civilization can bring to the inculcation of moral and religious truth. The African-Aid Society was formed that it might apply and urge the application of what was evidently so much needed. When it expressed its desire to conduct an emigration of coloured people from Canada and the United States to Africa, it was that it might introduce in their persons engineers, machinists, carpenters, blacksmiths, masons, cabinetmakers, brick and tile makers, trained agriculturists, millwrights, wheelwrights, coopers, waggon builders, road makers, &c., &c., &c. The progress of conviction as to the necessity of this has been slow in England. And this is not surprising, because it had not possessed the missionary mind in Africa. Any imaginable sum might be asked for religious missionary purposes in Africa, and it would be obtained. But ask for a small sum to teach the Africans the comforts and decencies, conveniences and industrial appliances of civilised life, and no national sentiment responded to the appeal. This is manifestly wrong. What we have freely received we ought freely to give. We, as a people, two thousand years ago had aid to help us out of our barbarism. The Britons were not left to imagine the utility of roads, and the advantage of clearings through forests: the Romans made roads and clearings for them. They were not left to imagine the advantage and comfort of solidly-constructed and comparatively commodious edifices: the Romans built towns and villages among them. And their work was not intended for mere temporary use alone. Substantial traces of it remain to this day. They are continually challenging our gratitude and admiration. And shall we not imitate in some degree the beneficial example? Shall we not strive to confer solid material benefits upon that Africa we so long assisted to rob of its most valuable possession—its human life; that we so long assisted to plunge deeper and deeper into the thick mire of barbarism, instead of helping her out of it? Our responsibilities toward Africa are far heavier than the public conscience has yet acknowledged. We know all the difference that exists between Great Britain now in Africa, and Rome formerly in Britain. Rome was laying the foundation for a permanent domination. We are not. Nationally, therefore, there is no analogy. But Rome had no such hideous debt of blood to Britain as we have to Africa. And we are Christian, not Pagan. We profess to be governed by higher principles than the Romans knew. We must, therefore, both as Government and people, do more than we have hitherto done for Africa. We must send her other teachers, as well as religious ones. We must establish centres of mechanical and other industry. The missionary mind in Africa is opening to this great truth.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

It is indeed a compendium. It places before us in brief but luminous sketches, and with the aid of sixteen admirable maps and some seventy illustrations, all that is publicly known about Africa and its peoples—their specific peculiarities, character, manners, customs, and condition, physical and moral; with enumeration of its varied products, its trade and commerce. It is an admirable volume for all who desire general information respecting that great continent, into the dense darkness of which the light of civilization and Christianity has begun to penetrate, through the devoted exertions of missionaries and scientific explorers. Africa does not present us with any very pleasing pictures. They are all of barbarism, and for the most part barbarism of the lowest and most disgusting type, and yet such as awakes and impels to active exertion the warmest sympathies and desires of the Christian and philanthropist. Such books as this of Mr. Stanford\'s are particularly valuable in view of the extremely limited degree of information respecting Africa possessed even by the majority of well-educated people in England. So many active agencies are now at work in and for Africa that some more intimate knowledge of it must be desired; while yet the labour of wading through long and dreary books of African travel, with their sadly monotonous succession of pictures of sparsely-inhabited countries, and of ignorance, suffering, cruelty, and moral degradation everywhere, deters most people from seeking it in their pages. This ""Compendium"" meets such desires, and gets rid of such difficulties, offering as a prize to be gained by a few leisure hours\' reading all that it is essential well-educated people should know of this great continent. The degree of knowledge thus to be obtained may lead some whose attention has not hitherto been called in that direction to desires and sympathies with regard to that long-neglected quarter of the world, and its wretched populations. We therefore hail its appearance with great pleasure, and strongly recommend ""Stanford\'s Compendium—Africa"" to our readers.

The textbook highlights instances such as the League of Nations' fact-finding mission to Liberia, which included representatives from eight nations, including Liberia, to tackle issues like slavery and forced labor, demonstrating a coordinated international initiative with both European and African participation. It also notes the involvement of African delegates in pan-African conferences organized by figures like W. E. B. Du Bois, indicating efforts to include African voices in discussions about political rights and self-determination. However, it underscores the limitations of these efforts, pointing out the entrenched colonialism by the 1930s and the divisive European approach that often prioritized European interests over genuine collaboration. Similarly, The African Times articles describe various committees and commissions in places like Sierra Leone, Gambia, and Lagos, which included both European and African members, such as the Hon. T. J. Sawyerr and Dr. David P. Ross in Sierra Leone, and African chiefs in the Native Committee in Accra, reflecting a structured approach to governance and collaboration. Yet, the articles also highlight the dominant European influence in initiatives like the European Conference and the Anti-Slavery Conference.

E. B. Du Bois in various European capitals (Paris, 1919; London, Brussels and Paris, 1921; London and Lisbon, 1923) which dominated the organized pan-Africanist move› ment. Du Bois himself, in turn, dominated these next three Congresses. He convened the first in Paris in 1919, while in France to cover the Paris Peace Conference for The Crisis, to collect information for a proposed 'History of the American Negro in The Great War'; and to lobby for the political rights of 'the Darker races living within the U.S. as well as throughout the rest of the world'.$^{52}$ Among the resolutions adopted at the Paris Congress in 1919 was a resolution calling for self-determination for Africans."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.627, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Pan-Africanism: political and cultural aspects', 'content': ""In keynoting the pan-Africanist 'International Conference on the Negro', convened at Tuskegee in the spring of 1912, Washington stressed the theme of an exchange of techniques and resources between blacks in Africa and America.

For example, a Tuskegee mission to Togoland (now Togo) had arrived in 1901 at the invitation of the German colonial government; the mission was designed to improve African methods of cotton cultivation. Success of the mission led to further invitations for missions to Tanganyika (now Tanzania), Zanzibar and Sudan; and to Washington being invited to set up shop in South Africa.\nRelated Tuskegee/Washington pan-Africanist activities included meet› ings of the Negro Business League in 1908, at which Washington showed his appreciation of pan-Africanism for African/Afro-American interchange.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome.

These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

I have, then, allowed myself to believe that it might be made convenient to you to meet here to discuss and decide in common, with that authority which is yours, the ways to be followed and the means to be employed to plant definitely the standard of civilization on the soil of Central Africa; to decide in what manner the public may be interested in your noble enterprise, and be induced to find the means. For in works of this kind it is the co-operation of many which makes success; it is the sympathy of the masses which one must solicit and know how to obtain. What resources would one not have at disposal if everybody to whom a franc was of no object, would consent to throw their mite into the fund destined to suppress the traffic in the interior of Africa! Great progress has already been effected. The unknown has been approached from many sides, and, if those here present, who have enriched science with such important discoveries would recount to us the principal points, their recital would be to all a powerful encouragement. Among the questions which we have to examine, the following have occurred to me: (1.) To decide upon the bases of operation to be acquired upon the Zanzibar coast, and near the mouth of the Congo, either by agreement with the chiefs or by purchase or hire, according to each particular case. (2.) To determine the routes towards the interior to be opened successively, and to organize scientific and philanthropic stations (hospitalières) as a means of abolishing slavery and establishing peace between the chiefs, &c. (3.) The formation (the work being well defined) of an international and central committee, and national committees, each to carry into execution that which concerns them, and to place the object before the public of every country, and to make an appeal to the charitable, to whom a good cause has never been pleaded in vain. Such are the different points which seem to merit your attention; if there are others they will occur to you in your discussions, and you will not fail to meet them. My wish is to serve, as you may point out, the great cause for which you have already done so much. I place myself at your disposal in this matter, and I cordially wish you a hearty welcome.""'}, {'id': 5348, 'article_title': 'Colonial and Indian Exhibition', 'full_section_title': 'Colonial and Indian Exhibition', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1886#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_04_1886', 'content': ""It is now officially announced that this Exhibition will be opened on Tuesday, May 4th, when the ceremony will be performed by Her Majesty.\n\n### WEST AFRICAN COLONIES.\n\n#### COMMISSION IN LONDON.\n\n**Executive Commissioner.**—Sir James Marshall, Richmond House, Roehampton, S.W.\n\n**Committee.**—The Right Hon.

They suggested an international understanding which would generalise their operation, inasmuch as the slave-trade was now confined to a zone the boundaries of which could be defined with accuracy. They proposed joint action against the maritime trade within this zone and especially between the two shores of the Red Sea, the common punishment of slave-traders whatever their nationality, the appointment of international tribunals to inflict such punishment, the regulated liberation of slaves, and precautions by each Power to prevent the registration of slave-trading vessels under its flag. In regard to the slave-raiders the object of the Conference was to substitute collective for individual action. Next, the Conference would have to consider the means of striking a death-blow to the traffic generally by the suppression of the markets of destination. Last, the Conference would have to deal with the liquor and arms and ammunition trade as affecting the social and moral condition of the natives.\n\nNo Power but Great Britain had drawn up any scheme of action. It was, therefore, left to Baron Lambermont, as President, to lay before the Conference such materials and propositions as he thought fitting. His plan was to deal with the slave-trade in its three manifestations—(1) its inception and the inland traffic, (2) the maritime traffic, and (3) the destination or ultimate market for the slave. The chapters, as the work after its completion now distributes itself, are as follows:— Chapter I.—Places of capture. II.—Caravan routes. III.—Maritime traffic. IV.—Countries of destination. V.—Institutions created for the purpose of insuring the execution of the general Act. VI.—Liquor traffic. VII.—General provisions. VIII.—Revision of the Act of Berlin—i.e., the customs régime in the Congo Valley.\n\nThe modus operandi of the Conference was to deal with the chapters in committees formed of the plenipotentiaries and special delegates of the Powers chiefly interested, to which all the Powers had equal access. These committees drew up reports which were printed and distributed for consideration by the different Governments before the plenary meetings of the Conference were held thereon. Any subsidiary objections could thus be raised at the plenary meeting when the articles were passed.""}, {'id': 6183, 'article_title': 'AFRICANS IN LONDON', 'full_section_title': 'AFRICANS IN LONDON', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_01_1892#article-4', 'issue_date': '04_01_1892', 'content': 'The lot of a Native of West Africa, who may be staying in London for the first time, is not a very enviable one.

The first was in favour of establishing a trunk route, and advocated a survey to select the most suitable bases of operations. Stations would be established on this route, the principal being at Nyangore and Tyi. Civilization and commerce were to be the first consideration, then science. Russia, Austria, and Germany appeared to desire that science should hold the most prominent position in the work and advised the establishment of independent stations. Cameron's route was named as being the best to adopt.\n\nBrussels, Thursday, Sept. 14th.—The Congress has come to a somewhat abrupt termination, possibly owing in some degree to the number of members, and the diversity of opinion on many points, rendering it difficult to arrive at any practical and exact determination. It has, however, been decided to form an International Association, with the view of exploring Africa and suppressing slavery. An international commission will be composed of two members from each country, with the power of nominating additional honorary members; the executive committee shall consist of president, general secretary, and three or four members, and there will be national committees in each country. According to the arrangements at first made, the Congress was to elect the international commission, which was, in its turn, to name the members of the executive committee; but by some apparent oversight the executive committee has been nominated, and with it will rest the duty of electing those under whom it will work. Sir Bartle Frere asked the King to fill the post as president, but his Majesty replied that, although it would be a pleasure to him to accept, yet, in his opinion, it should go by rotation amongst different nations, and should only be held for a term. England, France, and Germany provide the members of the executive committee, Sir Bartle Frere, Dr. Quatrefages, and Dr. Nachtigal, having been chosen. The Marquis de Compiègne and M. Henri Duveyrier gave an account of their travels in Africa, and the conference then closed. The pleasing duty of returning thanks,\n\nto the King for his interest in the matter devolved upon Admiral de la Roncière. His Majesty, in reply, thanked the members cordially for their co-operation, and placed himself at the disposal of the executive committee which sits to-morrow. By this it will be seen that the whole question will now necessarily be conducted by correspondence between the different committees, and that it depends for success upon the zeal shown by the members."", 'last_edit_date': '1876-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1876#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.62, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE ANTI-SLAVERY CONFERENCE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Anti-Slavery Conference has now practically concluded its labours. Its sittings began on November 18, and if the duration of the Conference has been protracted, the work done has been surrounded by difficulties, and the result is of great importance. To understand the scope and bearing of its labours it is necessary to give some few particulars of its objects and origin.\n\nThe opening up of the African continent to European enterprise and civilisation had recalled faults committed of old in similar movements where the unregulated advance of Europeans had led to the moral degradation of the natives and to lowering the standard of conduct among Europeans themselves. The reports, too, of Mr. Stanley and other explorers has roused public opinion and forced Governments to consider the means of co-operating against the Arab slave-raiders. Lastly, the whole coast-line having now been marked out as within the sphere of influence of one Power or another, it had become possible to cut the communication between the places of origin of the slave-trade and the markets for which the raiders destined their captives.\n\nThis was felt in 1885 at the Berlin Conference, where the British Plenipotentiaries brought forward a resolution in favour of joint action in a department of the question which until then it had been impossible to deal with. An article of the Berlin General Act had provided that—""All the Powers exercising rights of sovereignty or any influence in the territories in question undertake to watch over the preservation of the native races, and the improvement of their moral and material conditions of existence, and to co-operate in the suppression of slavery, and especially in the negro traffic; they will protect and favour, without distinction of nationalities or worship, all religious, scientific, or charitable institutions and undertakings, created and organised for this object, or tending to instruct the natives and make them understand and appreciate the advantages of civilisation.""\n\nAt the suggestion of the British Plenipotentiaries a special article was added to extend the international obligation of acting against the slave-trade, not only at sea, but also on land. This was Article 9, which provided that—""In accordance with the principles of the law of nations as recognised by the signatory Powers, the slave-trade being forbidden, and the operations which on land and on sea furnish slaves for the traffic also being considered as forbidden, the Powers which exercise or which shall exercise rights of sovereignty or any influence in the territories forming the conventional basin of the Congo, declare that these territories cannot serve either as a market or as a means of transit of slaves, of whatsoever race they may be.

The Board is convinced that the time has now arrived when her Majesty\'s Government may advantageously take into consideration the subject of the better administration of these regions. I am instructed respectfully to state that after full examination of the subject the Board has been led to the conclusion that the union of the Royal Niger Company\'s territory, the Niger Coast Protectorate, and Lagos in one colony under the control of the Colonial Office would afford the surest basis for the removal of these difficulties. The advantages offered by this arrangement are that the present Customs and boundary troubles would be done away with, that complications with foreign Powers would be minimised, and that great economies would be rendered possible in the cost of administration. Should, however, her Majesty\'s Government find it impracticable to bring about such an amalgamation at present, the Board desires to urge that whatever may be done in the meantime, falling short of this, should be considered to be of a temporary nature, having in view the ultimate consolidation of these territories under one Government. In any case the Board is of opinion that as an interim step the present boundary between Nigeria and the Niger Coast Protectorate should be abolished, the interior customs ports removed, and the two districts placed under the administration of the Colonial Office, or that some other arrangement should be made withdrawing the administrative powers of the Royal Niger Company, equitable compensation being paid to the Company for the large sums of money spent and the great services rendered by it in preserving to the British flag this large and populous tract of Africa.\n\n""If neither of these courses should be thought desirable, it appears absolutely necessary that a Custom\'s Union, to which the three administrations should be parties, should be established with as little delay as possible, with a view to the removal of the difficulties already referred to.—I have, &c.,\n\n(Signed) **Elijah Helm, Sec.**', 'last_edit_date': '1897-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1897#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.609, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICA AT THE MEETING OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the meeting of the British Association, held this year at Newcastle-on-Tyne, the things of Africa came in for a good deal of discussion and consideration.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE AFRICAN INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'An official contradiction has been given to the report that the Association is negotiating with an English company for the construction of a railway between the Lower and Upper Congo regions; and that the administrative staff of the Association is composed in great part of Englishmen.

The first phase lasted from 1880 to the early 1900s, and the second from the early 1900s to the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Each of these phases saw different European activities which produced different initiatives and reactions on the part of the Africans.

Variables included the nature of the polity (whether or not centralized, whether or not dominated by another African power, and whether or not on the upswing or settled and declining), 1 the nature of the leadership provided, the extent of the penetration of European political, religious and economic influences by the 1870s and the experiences gained from this. Another equally important variable was the method adopted by the European imperialists in the establishment of their control over the area between 1880 and 1914.\nThe first phase saw either the use of diplomacy or military invasion, or both, by the Europeans. This was the classical era of treaty-making in practically every nook and corner of West Africa followed in most cases by military invasions, conquests and occupation by armies of varying sizes and discipline. The period from 1880 to 1900 was the high-water mark of European conquest and occupation of West Africa. Never in the known history of the continent has so much military action been seen and so many invasions and campaigns launched against African states and communities (see Fig. 6.1). Particularly memorable were the French campaigns in the Western Sudan, Ivory Coast and Dahomey (now Benin) between 1880 and 1898, and the British campaigns in Asante (in what is now Ghana), the Niger Delta region (Nigeria) and in Northern Nigeria between 1895 and 1903 (see Fig. 6.2).', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.711, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'Conquest and reaction in British West Africa, 1880-1900 > Southern Nigeria', 'content': ""While the Yoruba, by and large, chose the strategy of submission, the rulers of the kingdom of Benin and some of the rulers of the states of the Niger Delta chose that of confrontation.

This, of course, would not be tolerated in that age, and using the killing of the British acting consul-general and five other Englishmen on their way to Benin as an excuse, the British launched a punitive expedition of 1500 men against Benin in 1897. Though the Oba himself would have liked to submit, a majority of his chiefs raised an army to beat back the invasion. They were, however, defeated and the capital was looted of its precious bronze treasures and then burnt. 48 In the Niger Delta, as in many other areas of Nigeria, the British had signed treaties of protection with most of the chiefs by 1884.

Moreover, all of them were insisting on their sovereign rights to regulate trade and to levy duties on British traders. This, the new British consuls, such as Hewett and Johnston, would not tolerate. A typical example of the rulers who stood up to the British consuls and missionaries was Jaja of Opobo (see Plate 6.3). He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order.

Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

Encouraged by Porto Novo itself, a French protectorate was declared over this coastal Aja state in 1863 to check further British advance along the coast to the west. Both the British and the French soon discovered the obvious: that the real value of Lagos or Porto Novo was to be measured in terms of the trade with the hinterland in the Yoruba and Aja interior which the two ports shared. This involvement of both Britain and France in the trade and politics of Lagos and Porto Novo respectively sparked off a spell of dramatic rivalry between the two powers in a bid to control Yorubaland, especially the western parts, and the adjacent Aja-speaking communities.

This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.\nIn the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium. Major Christian missionary bodies such as the Church Missionary Society (CMS) of the Church of England and the Lyons-based SociØtØ des Missions Africaines (SMA) of the Roman Catholic Church each employed a mix of European nationals.

The pioneer SMA Fathers in most parts of the area which became Nigeria were French, just as it was such British missionaries as Thomas Birch Freeman of the Methodists and Samuel Ajayi Crowther of the CMS who pioneered the work of Christian missions in what was to become French Dahomey (present-day People's Republic of Benin).$^{33}$ British, French, German and Portuguese traders set up businesses adjacent to one another and, as the case of Badagry clearly demonstrated, there were residential quarters for diverse European nationals in the major ports all along the coast of the Bight of Benin.\nTraders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': ""As already mentioned, the social effects of foreign rule were far from uniform throughout the continent. With respect to the spread of education, the triumph of the new economic forces, the expansion of urbanization and therefore the rise of the new elites, West Africa would appear to have witnessed the greatest advances, followed by Egypt and the Maghrib, South Africa, East Africa and Central Africa. If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind. And even among the British territories, there was also a differential impact. The British colonies where substantial transforma- tions were registered included Egypt, Gold Coast, Nigeria, Uganda and Sierra Leone, with Kenya and the Rhodesias (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) coming after. And if we take individual colonies we discover that more changes took place in the southern than in the northern parts of Gold Coast and Nigeria. In Francophone Africa, on the other hand, the West African colonies would come first, followed by the North African colonies and then French Equatorial Africa. Within French West Africa, Senegal and Dahomey (now Benin) led the way with the other colonies lagging rather far behind.\nThe fact was that the spread and impact of the forces of change were controlled by more factors than any colonial government or African group was in a position to master completely. First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century.

The ARPS was easily the most active. It was formed to protest against the Land Bill of 1896 which was to give control of all so-called waste or unoccupied lands to the government. As a result of a delegation it dispatched to London in 1898 which met the Secretary of State for Colonies, this obnoxious Bill was withdrawn. From then on, the ARPS sent a series of petitions to the local administration as well as the Colonial Office protesting against various projected Bills. It sent two delegations to England, one in 1906 to demand the repeal of the 1894 Towns Ordinance and the second in 1911 to oppose the Forestry Bill of 1910. It was certainly the most successful of the mouthpieces of the elite and traditional rulers of West Africa and the greatest opponent of colonialism until the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa after the First World War. In French West Africa, the Young Senegalese Club formed in 1910 also actively campaigned for equal rights.\nIt should be evident from this discussion that the peoples of West Africa devised all kinds of strategies and tactics first to oppose the establish› ment of the colonial system and second, after the failure of their early efforts, to resist certain specific measures and institutions of the system.

It appears that there is an impression on the minds of the people in some of the villages where the road-tax had been commenced that the tax is collected from them to make good the streets, &c., of Freetown; because after the tax had been collected from those who could pay, the defaulters were called upon to clean the roads in the best way they could; so that work which was formerly done by the whole of the villagers is thrown upon a comparatively few defaulters.

It commands the mouth of a navigable waterway, along which England's authority might have spread over the whole interior. From want of energy France has been allowed to take the upper waters under its protection; and the result is that the Gambia colony has to be described as small and retrograding. Not much better things can be said of the settlement of Sierra Leone. Its confines might have been expanded to take in the Upper Niger, which has its sources not far from the Sierra Leone boundary. At one time it was practicable to conciliate the friendship of the Mahommedan chief, Samadu, who has been building up an empire inland. The chance was postponed, and now Samadu has placed his kingdom under the protection of France. The colony of Lagos is the sole plantation at which Mr. Johnston can glance without vexation. There, though the Government delays to move the front of the harbour, and though official supineness is answerable for the interposition of wedges of foreign territory between Lagos and the Gold Coast, the spirit of English enterprise is seen.

West African Governors of the present type instruct the natives in the vegetable riches of their own land, and the acclimatisation of useful foreign plants, and they cultivate a fashion among their staffs of learning the native languages.

As must be well known to our readers, this colony was established about a hundred years ago, with the twofold purpose of providing a home, under British protection, for liberated slaves, and at the same time affording a starting-place from which the interior tribes might be reached, and gradually brought under the influence of civilization and Christianity. The improved condition of popular opinion upon the question of the Slave Trade has done away with the need contemplated in the first intention of its founders; but the second and more important part which was to be performed by the founding of this settlement, still remains, at least to a great extent, unfulfilled. In another column will be found some interesting particulars of the present depressed condition of Sierra Leone—a result brought about by the want of purpose manifested by those in charge—and showing the urgent need there is for opening up trade routes between the coast and the interior tribes, who, there is good reason to believe, will be only to ready to enter into commercial relations with the British and native traders on the coast. The Colonial Government—acting, there is reason to believe, on instructions received from the Home authorities—have not been so energetic in this direction as could be looked for, considering the importance of the interests committed to them. It is absolutely necessary for the future well-being and usefulness of the colony that means be taken by which the lawless and uncivilized tribes who surround the settlement should be brought to feel that their mutual jealousies and tribal disputes shall be no longer permitted, by blocking the trade routes through their regions, to interfere with the commerce that would otherwise be carried on between the settlement and the races beyond them. Sir Samuel Rowe's recent action seems to indicate that he is determined to break through precedent where necessary for the well-being of the people under his charge; and though it would appear that he has not met with all the success that was to be hoped for, at least he has shown these lawless tribes that we can and will interfere where necessary for the protection of our interests, and the benefit of the more civilized peoples further away. Some of these races, separated from our colony by this zone of lawlessness, have given evidence more than once of a desire for commerce with our people. Only a short time before the reappointment of Sir Samuel Rowe as Governor, messengers arrived at Freetown from the powerful Chief, named Shahmadoo, of Beri, a place 800 or 900 miles in the interior, beyond Footah. We hear that this Shahmadoo had a large army with him, and had already advanced some distance towards the coast, having expressed his determination, if necessary, to fight the whole way along, and, indeed, that he had already arrived to within a hundred miles of Freetown. He was very desirous that some European officer should be deputed by the authorities to accompany the messengers back with him. His request, however, was not complied with, which is to be regretted, as he professed that his only object was to open up communications between the settlement and his own people, who appear to be a tribe of the Western Soudan. Their country has not been visited by Europeans during the last thirty years, and we are told that they have large stores of gold, ivory, and other commodities, which might be exchanged with profit in Sierra Leone. Taking the account of these people for what it is worth, this, at least, seems to be clear, that there are in the interior races much more highly civilized than those nearer the coast, who will be quite ready directly the opportunity is given them of engaging in commerce with our West Coast settlements, and thus relieving them of the great depression under which they have lately been languishing."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1885#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.741, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The present is a very critical time in the history of the British West African Colonies.

Colonel Niven, Administrator-in-Chief, attended by request of the parties to witness the signing of the treaty of peace between Lahai Bundoo and Gbannah Lehrey, two powerful chiefs, who had been at war with each other for a long time past. Various Consuls were present, and a guard of honour of 200 men of the 1st West India Regiment also attended. The treaties stipulated that the various parties would act peaceably towards each other, and that in the event of any disputes arising the matters should be referred to the British Governor at Sierra Leone, whose decision would be final. There were some 300 chiefs, present with their headmen, &c., and it is expected that the meeting will put an end to the numerous quarrels and conflicts which have occurred in this district. After the proceedings a number of English and other traders addressed a letter to Colonel Niven, requesting him to allow Day Mauro, King of Bullom, and Allimany Sawassi, Chief Medina, to go up to Fort Hokkoh to settle a war then going on between two powerful chiefs and their followers. They believed that the influence of the two chiefs mentioned could be successfully used to put a stop to further fighting. Colonel Niven promised to consider the matter.\n\nIt was officially announced that the blockade at the port of Brass by the English men-of-war would not take place, as the fine demanded by Commodore Richards had been paid by the natives.\n\nThe English schooner, William the Sixth, belonging to Mr. T.

The cablegram says the Governor was stopped by the French and Konnohs at Coongeah, or Loongeah, and that they threatened to kill him. The Governor in question is Colonel F. Cardew, who sailed from Liverpool on February 28 last to take up the administration of the Sierra Leone colony in succession to Sir Francis Fleming. Colonel Cardew appears to have lost no time in going into the interior. The Konnohs are the tribe that attempted to stop the advance of the West India Regiment under the command of the late Colonel Ellis, just prior to the deplorable French and English collision. The West Indians at that time drove the Konnohs before them from place to place, and it was then thought that they had received a lesson that would have lasted them for years. It is therefore feared that they have taken courage at some action of the French, although it is scarcely believed that the French would incite them to oppose the English Governor. It is also not credited here that the threat to kill the Governor was made by the French, but must have been on the part of the Konnohs. Loongeah or Coongeah cannot be located, but there is an important town called Lungay, between Tagreer and Scarciss on the Bullon Shore in the Kaffwee-Bullon district.

It is about 102 years old, thus considerably younger than the Gambia, which almost ranks with Newfoundland as being one of the very first British possessions abroad. Sierra Leone, however, has not much to show for its century of British rule. Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary. Here at present the great Mahommedan Chief Samadu is the actual ruler, and has created one of those African empires which are easily reared by successful robbers with extravagant bloodshed and widespread depredation. Samadu has several times fought the French on the Senegambian frontier, but of late he is said to have concluded peace with them. The productions of Sierra Leone are those of true Western Africa, and the colony is rich and well-favoured in vegetable wealth. It exports palm oil, palm kernels, rubber, gum, camwood, besides skins and benniseed and ground nuts.\n\nLiberia is British in language, and to a great extent in such culture as it possesses, although it enjoys an independent Government. But its native inhabitants, the Kru-boys, are under the delusion that they are British subjects ""of a sort,"" and do not admit any political connexion with the Americanised negroes who claim to govern them. On the east of Liberia, between the frontier and the west boundary of the French Gold Coast, is the Ivory Coast, about 100 miles in extent, and one of the last portions of the African coast, which remains unclaimed, unprotected, and unannexed by any European Power.

The question under discussion is one of those curious points which sometimes arise in treaties relating to countries of which maps can give only an approximately correct idea. For the past twenty-five years France has been gradually closing in upon Sierra Leone, whose sole trade is in the various products which reach the coast from the interior. This trade is now a valuable one, the exports amounting to something like £400,000 a year, and the imports, mostly from England, to a similar sum. In August 1889, a convention was come to between the two countries as to the spheres of influence in the ""Hinterland,"" and it was agreed that the boundaries of Sierra Leone should not extend beyond 11:40 of longitude West of Greenwich and 10 degrees of latitude. Near the borderline was the important native town of Fararma, situated almost at the source of the River Niger. It is here that the native caravans on their way to Sierra Leone from the interior have to cross the river, and it is consequently a place of great commercial importance. On the French maps Fararma is shown well within the French boundary; but accurate observation demonstrates that it is really within the British limits, and the inhabitants of Sierra Leone are anxious to retain this important entrepôt of trade in their own hands. It is the neck of the bottle through which the trade of the colony flows, and this is recognised by the French no less than by the English colonists. France is therefore doing her utmost to obtain such a modification of the Convention above referred to as will give her control over this trade centre. The bait held out to our Government is some concession in that no-man\'s-land, the region around Lake Chad. Meanwhile the inhabitants of Sierra Leone are alarmed at the danger which threatens their trade, and have pointed out to Lord Salisbury and Lord Knutsford that Sierra Leone is of great strategical importance to the Empire, and that the cession of Fararma to France, by enabling the French to deflect the trade to their Senegal and Niger colonies, must result in the destruction of the commerce of Sierra Leone and in its eventually being absorbed into the French colonies, by which it is even now almost entirely hemmed in.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.741, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Although the Lagos Colony extends on paper as far as the right bank of the Benin, no authority is exercised by the Lagos officials further east than Leki.

Consul Blair, with all the white traders, left for the city of Benin on May 6, taking presents to the King from the English Government. The mission was accompanied by fifty Houssa soldiers, and got within twenty-five miles of the city. Here the King had promised to meet the expedition, and to have hammocks and men ready to convey the Englishmen up to his town. Neither the King nor his men, however, put in an appearance, and the Consul despatched a messenger to the city. The latter, however, did not return, having been detained by the King. The Consul himself had in the meantime become ill from exposure to the weather, and after waiting three days the expedition returned on the 12th to Benin. It was the general feeling that the King did not want to see the expedition, and that had they persisted in going up it was likely they would not have been allowed to return. From Brass River the Benguela brings news of a shocking case of cannibalism in which nine men were devoured. The affair occurred some thirty miles up the river. It seems that a powerful Prince called Allagohga, when trading in a native village, was shot at and wounded in the shoulder. The would-be murderer, who fired from behind a tree, was traced to a village some miles away; but there he was lost sight of, and nothing more was seen of him. Then, as he could not be found, the Prince took as hostages nine of the men from the village. At the entreaty of the King the Prince promised that no harm should be done the men if the native who wounded him was given up.

It makes sense, as Boahen has suggested, to see the events of the time and their key actors in terms of diplomacy, pursued independently or backed by force. To appreciate the extent to which diplomacy could go, it is necessary to understand the socio-economic forces operating in a particular society at the time of the encounter. For East Africa, a survey of such factors in the 1890s will be an appropriate setting for the events that followed. But, as R. I. Rotberg and Ali Mazrui state: 'There is no gainsaying that the introduction of Western norms and power and accompanying controls was everywhere in Africa questioned by the people affected'. 2 This questioning, however, took various forms.

Euro-African contacts, which until the beginning of our period had been confined largely to the coastal peripheries, were, in the period under review, steadily extended inland as a result of the Industrial Revolution, largely through the efforts first of explorers, then traders and, finally, missionaries. This steady extension of European contacts and influence inland included not only guns and powder, but also railways, telegraphs, agricultural and mining machinery, the print› ing press, technical education and, above all, finance capital. These new developments created opportunities, but also challenges and dangers. Among the most novel and interesting features of African history during the period were the initiatives and reactions of African rulers and advisers in the face of these opportunities and challenges. It would appear that in most cases the approach of the Africans was not simply one of blind imitation or wholesale substitution but rather one of adaptation and syn› thesis. Instances of this process of modernization in Africa are legion. 56 Egypt built its first printing press at Büläk, Cairo, in 1822; the first printing press was established in Portuguese Luanda in 1841; the first modern mines were opened in Algeria in 1845 and in the Gold Coast in the 1870s. Some of the states, such as Ethiopia and Tunisia, embarked on public works; nearly all the Barbary states, as well as Egypt reformed their monetary systems. Other states, such as Egypt, set up textile and cotton mills, saw mills, glassworks and paper mills, all during the reign of Muhammad 'AIL But more interesting and of far-reaching consequence was the moder› nization process in the military sphere. In the face of steady European encroachment, many African states, especially in North and West Africa, modernized the organization, training, equipment and recruitment of their armies.

As we have seen above, the fundamental issue at stake between the 1880s and the 1900s as far as the African rulers were concerned, was that of sove› reignty, and on this, it was quite clear that nobody was prepared to compromise. Those African rulers who have been mistakenly termed collaborators were those who thought that the best way of safeguarding their sovereignty or even regaining the sovereignty that they might have lost to some African power previous to the arrival of the Europeans was not to collaborate but rather to ally with the European invaders. A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation. But as we have seen, the Africans were all faced with the question of surrendering, retaining or regaining their sovereignty.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.\nThis flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours.

At one time, he would play the two Christian sects, Catholics and Protestants, against Muslims when he thought the latter were becoming too powerful and therefore threatening his control of the country. At another time, he would ally with Muslims against Catholics or Protestants or both depending on who he thought was dangerous to his rule. Thus, Mwanga was adept at the diplomatic game of divide and rule, a tactic which the colonizing powers were able to use so effectively in controlling Africa. When it was necessary, Mwanga resorted to a revival of some old tradition in an attempt to drive out all foreigners as happened in 1888.$^{30}$ On this occasion, he intended to entice all foreigners and their Baganda followers to a naval parade on an island on Lake Victoria. There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome.

The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era.

Largely because of the writings of the djihad leaders and European travellers, we know enough about the complex of forces and ideas that produced the series of revolutionary movements starting from Futa Toro, Futa Jallon and Bondu in the eighteenth century and stretching to the Sokoto, Massina and Dinguiraye djihäds in the nineteenth. We therefore do not need to speculate about the possible contribution to that complex of forces and ideas of European mercantilist influence in the days of the slave trade or capitalist influence in the days of abolition and journeys of discovery. The initiative for the djihäd movements came from within. The djihäd states took a great interest in promoting agriculture, partly through traditional household production, partly also through estates worked by slave or client labour. They also promoted industrial manufacture and trade. They improved trade routes and offered protection to traders and merchants. By far the greatest portion of the traffic on the routes was for local and regional exchange. But the djihad leaders also promoted trans-Saharan trade routes and the pilgrimage route to the Eastern Sudan, the Nile Valley and Mecca. Evidence is building up that these internal trading initiatives had developed trade routes that permitted trans-continental traffic before the new European trade of the nineteenth century.$^{28}$ The Europeans, of course, were quick to note the results of these internal initiatives and were attracted to the possibility of profiting from them.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Introduction', 'content': 'The djihäd movements of Islamic reformation covered the whole of the Sudanic zone of West Africa, and the eastern Sahara up to Cyrenaica, and spread south to the borders of the forest region as their impact reached Senegambia and the Voltaic regions, the southern Mandinka, northern Yoruba and the Edo-speaking peoples. As the European demand for palm oil, peanuts, ivory, sisal and rubber grew and the internal network of long› distance trade routes responded to these demands, trade became a major factor affecting access to firearms and the acquisition of wealth, and hence the rise and fall of states over wide areas of Africa. As a consequence of this expanding European trade and the activities of European and American missionaries, Christianity and European ideas of social and political organ› ization also became factors of change over a wide area stretching from Sierra Leone to Southern Africa and Madagascar.\nWhat stands out most prominently in these different movements is the efforts of various African leaders in the nineteenth century in different parts of the continent to reform their societies. Some of the efforts were inspired by the heritage of cultures in Africa, others by reformist ideas in Islam. In most cases, the leaders were only too ready to take advantage of opportunities offered by the expanding scope of trade and the activities of Europeans, whether traders or missionaries, hunters of game or hunters of concessions. Another feature that stands out just as prominently was how these efforts of African leaders to reform were systematically being undermined by the very activities of European traders, missionaries and hunters that African leaders tried to exploit.\nIt is remarkable how little attention so far has been paid to this feature of the nineteenth century: of internal efforts at reform systematically being aborted by external intervention. Because of the assumption that colonialism and integration into the world economy were necessary con› ditions of modernization, most historians have failed to notice how much the nineteenth century represented an African effort at self-development and to what extent European conquest and colonialism was a subversion of that effort.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Again various societies had had different levels of contact with Europeans or Arabs, the two external forces impinging on East Africa at this time. On the whole, coastal areas had had a longer contact with Europeans and Arabs than the interior areas. Of the interior peoples, three or four groups had had longer contact with the Arabs than the rest. The Akamba in Kenya and the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika were involved in the caravan trade from the interior to the coast - a phenomenon often referred to as long-distance trade.$^{5}$ The Baganda as well as the Wanga in Kenya had also had contact with Arabs trading in ivory and slaves prior to the 1890s. Again the degree of exposure to these outside influences determined the type and extent of resistance put up by various societies.\nApart from these human influences, there were ecological changes taking place in East Africa in the 1890s, which also affected response to foreign penetration. The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all. A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya.

This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

If Neapolitan sailing ships were making for the coast and caught sight of a Tunisian or Tripolitanian flag, their crews were quick to make their escape.

It is doubtful whether African leaders realized until too late how great was the danger that threatened them. They were used to thinking that the European base was far away and that, in the final analysis, they had the advantage of numbers.\nThey continued to act as if they could play off one European power against another. In South Africa, they even believed that they could appeal to the Queen of England and her direct representatives to carry out treaty obligations against the wishes of Anglo-Boer settlers and fortune seekers. Far from any notion of forging a pan-African solidarity similar to that pursued by the Europeans, each African state acted as seemed best in its own individual interest.\nIt appears that, if any factor is to be singled out, the basic explanation for this was to be found not only in the diplomatic abilities of the European strategists, but also in the legacy of wars that was part of the revolutionary situation of nineteenth-century Africa. It was the intensity of the rivalries and the bitterness of the wars that made African rulers slow to realize that tackling the European threat should have taken precedence over their inter› state rivalries, and that they should have united to face it.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 65, 'article_title': 'EXTRACT FROM A JOURNAL KEPT ON THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA.—No. II.', 'full_section_title': 'EXTRACT FROM A JOURNAL KEPT ON THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA.—No. II.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1862#article-19', 'issue_date': '23_12_1862', 'content': '\n\n*Ambriz, August 4, 1843.*—We arrived here on the 29th of last month, and have been hard at work ever since getting our cargo landed. We have not had to build a house, as at Loango, but succeeded to the one lately occupied by the captain of one of T.\'s ships, who has been on this coast sixteen months, and is now ready for departure. The house is a very large one—a single storey, consisting, as usual, of three rooms. We are going to enlarge it still more, and make a private sitting-room and otherwise improve it, and I expect in a month or two it will be a delightful residence, and very picturesque. Ambriz is a beautiful spot, more fertile and lovely than Loango. Every one says it is a healthy country, and I should think so from its appearance—high and cool, exposed continually to a fine sea breeze. To-day I have been left alone. Mr. M. has gone to Mozula, to see about establishing a factory there, and I, having nothing to do, determined to have a long walk, and to think of my own dear, far-off home. Without considering, I naturally and irresistibly was led to the sea-shore. When I go out of our door, the wide ocean is right before me, about a quarter of a mile distant. Could I do else than go towards it? There is, almost without exception, a continual succession of breakers along the coast. The sea breaks first about 300 yards from the beach, in a long line of foam; then that white surf rolls onwards towards you; another breaks and follows, till you see seven or eight parallel wreaths of boiling foam, one succeeding the other to the shore. It is a grand sight to witness, and the deafening sound—equalling the falling of ten thousand houses—is awful. After sitting awhile I went onward, and the land changed its aspect, and became more beautiful—steep and lofty cliffs, white sand, and rock, extend for miles along the coast; and turning more inland, I came to a small green valley. Now, generally, the country here at present appears sterile and bare, white sand being the most prevalent description of ground (though I believe rich earth lies underneath). Well, but here everything was delicious and fresh, and I was not long in discovering the reason: a little spring bubbled up, half hidden with leaves, and, running on, gave life and fertility to the soil. It was a sweet spot, and I could have stayed for hours. I took a drink, and determined that henceforth our water should be brought from there, what we get at present not being very good. I went a mile or two further, and seeing that the sun was going down, I thought it advisable to return, and in trying to cut the road short I lost my way, and got into jungles and long grass that I could not see over; wandering about, first one way and then another, and a fear of wild beasts or snakes crept over me, and I wished myself snug at home. After some time I came again upon the beaten path, and glad I was.—August 23.—Some days ago we had an expedition to visit the King of Ambriz, who has his palace in a small mud village about eight miles distant. It is customary for all who come here for the first time to go and see him, and take some present for his Majesty, by way of insuring his protection and goodwill. A day or two previous to our intended journey we sent him word that he might be prepared for our reception, and not be taken unawares. He then gave us notice that on such a day he would be happy to receive us, not at his own town, but at one nearer, and, as he declared, more suitable. One morning, soon after sunrise, off we set, each reposing luxuriously in a hammock, borne by two men, one trotting before the other. We went along at a tolerable speed, having relays of bearers at certain distances; and in about two hours\' time we made out, from the signs and half-English jabber of our men, that we were near the village where we were to meet the King; and presently we saw peeping through the trees some dark countenances, which we presumed were the inhabitants of the city. We deemed it advisable to call a halt, as our headman and interpreter was some distance behind, and we wished to consult upon the most approved fashion for our progress. So we got out, dived into the depths of a basket for certain good things which we had provided, and waited for the arrival of our guide. In good time he came, and we determined to walk forwards, as we were given to understand it was not etiquette to ride. Mr. M. observed that there must be something wrong, as no one came forth to meet us excepting a few curs and screaming children; and here and there one of the fair sex might be seen running to get out of the way of the ""white man."" Mr. M. declared from these appearances that we were on the wrong scent, or that we were not expected; and we were giving our man a blowing up, and upbraiding him with deceiving us, when half-a-dozen old greybeards came marching along the path to meet us. They shook hands, and were about to apologise, I suppose, but we unceremoniously passed by them and entered the town—I say *town*, but if you want to picture to yourself the appearance of it, fancy a lot of huts, built of wood and mud, with pigsties adjoining, confusedly mixed, without the slightest order. Well, we stepped on at a good pace, gradually collecting a large retinue, and every one singing out in their language, ""White-man, white man!""

Herr Holub and his wife, who had accompanied him, with great difficulty succeeded in making their escape, and he has recently sent to the _Neue Freie Presse_ an interesting account of the catastrophe. He says that he had, after great difficulty, succeeded in reaching the territory of the Maschukulumbe. In this part of Africa it is impossible to obtain porters who are willing to give their services for the whole of the journey. The negroes are unwilling to leave the territory of their own tribe, and, as the villages are independent and often in a state of open hostility with their neighbours, it is necessary to change porters three or four times a day. Some men whom Herr Holub had engaged from the Matokas left him as soon as the expedition had reached the territory of the Maschukulumbe. They feared an attack from this tribe, which Herr Holub regards as the very scum of the negro race. When he reached the country to the north of Suenge he had lost half of his 70 bales of goods. He determined to rest a little in this region. Some of the Maschukulumbe informed him that a Portuguese trader was within a few hours' march, and that he would do well to go and meet him and make arrangements for reaching the Mankvu territory. Herr Holub, leaving his encampment in charge of two blacks who had remained faithful to him, and of two white men, Messrs. Fehete and Sollner, started to meet this Portuguese trader, but when he had gone some distance and could hear no tidings of him he began to suspect he had been betrayed, and hurried back to his encampment. On the way back he met Herr Fehete and the two blacks, who had fled from the encampment, which had been attacked during his absence and Herr Sollner killed. The small band, finding it impossible to return to the encampment, had to travel 400 miles in order to reach the Zambesi, without any baggage or ammunition, and Herr Holub had lost all his equipments and the natural history collections which he had got together at so much cost and labour. After enduring terrible privations he and his scanty band of followers succeeded in reaching the territory of the Matokas, not being able at last to march more than seven miles a day. Herr Holub was suffering from fever, and, to make matters worse, the King of the Matokas at first received him very badly at Mapanze, and refused to give him any assistance. But he changed his mind, and so Herr Holub was able to continue his route, and soon after, at the mouth of the River Tchobe, he got news of the presence of three English travellers, from whom he obtained further relief and whom he asked to forward to Europe this narrative of his sufferings.""}]","[{'document_title': 'Good Relations with Ashantee: How to Restore and Maintain them', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following suggestions on this important subject have been made by one long resident on the Gold Coast.

With this guarantee here, our Administrator could with every safety visit Ashantee, and display, in a dignified and graceful manner, the refined customs of Europe.

""I never clearly understood the object or the organization of the International African Association.

I perceived the justice of these arguments, and I had, moreover, at heart to remedy, as far as I could, the mischief which the Arabs and the population at the Falls had done in destroying the station at Stanley Falls.

The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation. They never heard now of the trader who went to Africa with the merely selfish object of making his fortune. Each and all became pioneers of civilisation, thinking only of the native first and self afterwards. They spoke as if the good to the native had been enormous, and that their intercourse with him had been a benefit and blessing. They pointed with pride to their sacrifices in the suppression of the slave trade, to their West Coast settlements as centres of secular light and leading; to their missionary stations as stars twinkling in the night of heathendom; to the returns of their trade with every entrance to the heart of Africa, as showing the spread of their beneficial influence. They saw that the work of other nations had been pernicious in the extreme, that they had been brutal in their dealings with native races, and had thought only of their own sordid interests and national aggrandisement—all in marked contrast to their aims and methods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'With the present class of trader little fault can be found.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

People feel jealous of being advised by foreigners; they feel that there is an assumption of superiority of wisdom and virtue; and selfish motives are attributed to the advisers. Now, I venture to think that this objection does not apply in the slightest degree to the meeting to-day. Some eighteen months ago her Majesty\'s Government made a proposal, not that we should go and teach other countries what was to be done about the slave trade, but assuming that all European nations are now inclined to carry out principles which have been proclaimed both by treaty and international communications for some seventy-five years. As against the slave trade, the Government felt that the moment had come when other countries desired to give practical effect to that policy. Lord Salisbury selected perhaps the individual who was best qualified for the duty to preside over the Conference of European Powers. I therefore accepted the invitation to come here with very great pleasure. I received a little shock when I saw in the newspapers that objections were made to our meeting by a society for which I have the very greatest possible respect—that important historical society, the Anti-Slavery Society. It is now more than fifty years ago, very soon after the Aborigines\' Protection Society was established, that I entered office under Lord Palmerston. The strongest political feeling Lord Palmerston had was his horror of the slave trade, and his determination to put it down, and no one who was not in the Foreign Office at the time with him could hardly be aware of the immense amount of energy and labour he devoted to the attainment of that object. Under these circumstances I was naturally in communication with the Anti-Slavery Society—and I have at times been in communication with it ever since. I say that any objection from the Anti-Slavery Society, or any communication from it, would come with great authority. I own that if the objection taken had been that our objects were unworthy, I should have been very much shaken. But it is not so; they agree with us entirely in thinking that this question of the supply of arms to the slave-traders and the question of the supply of alcohol to a great multitude of the African population is one of the most serious and dangerous importance. Their objection rests on a question of tactics. They think that there are two questions already brought before the Conference of vital importance, and that they might be endangered by any other question being raised there at all. But on this question I am not sure that the Anti-Slavery Society speak with greater authority than any other body of men. What is our position here? You have heard the first resolution. Other resolutions to be proposed will set out the prominent causes of the mischief, and the final resolution will be ""That copies of the foregoing resolutions be forwarded to his Majesty the King of the Belgians, the president of the International Conference, her Majesty\'s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and her Majesty\'s Minister at the Belgian Court."" There is nothing compulsory in that, and if Lord Salisbury and the King of the Belgians and Lord Vivian are of opinion that no new subject should be brought before the Conference, supposing they think it better to keep these resolutions a little in the background, in what way can our recommendations of today interfere with such a decision? If, they think that these subjects are so closely interweaved that they would not interfere with the general consent of the European Powers. I venture to think that it would strengthen the hands of Lord Salisbury and Lord Vivian, that a meeting under the presidency of the Lord Mayor had passed these resolutions. I said that it was a wise step to ask the King of the Belgians to take the initiative in this matter of the Conference. I think that it is impossible not to recognise why he has the greatest claims and qualifications for the task. In recent years we have seen men of great wealth making magnificent contributions to objects of philanthropy. The King of the Belgians has this pleasant characteristic, but none of the contributions approached in wideness of scope those of the King of the Belgians. We see what he has done, for instance, by the creation of the Congo State. He has not only given time and most anxious care to the affairs of the State—his contributions in a pecuniary sense are perfectly enormous. The official returns show the cost to be about £70,000 a year, and the whole comes from the King of the Belgians, not as Sovereign, but as a private individual from his private means. I have reason to believe that hundreds of thousands beyond that have been spent by him in this great work, and I think it is satisfactory that the King of the Belgians accepted the presidency of the Conference, the object of which is to give practical effect to principles which have really been sanctioned by the whole of Europe for some seventy-five years. I think it is becoming that this meeting we should commence operations by giving a vote of thanks to the King of the Belgians for the part he has taken in this important affair.

They must not if they could, and they ought not even if they wanted. They had laid themselves under an overwhelming load of debt to the African that centuries of beneficial work could never repay, and it would be well if they heard less about high-sounding words, schemes for the suppression of the African slave trade, and more practicable proposals for the stoppage of their equally ruin-working commerce in spirits and weapons of destruction. He might be disposed to join with such as demanded their withdrawal from Africa if it were not that on all sides he saw signs of hope, signs of the approach of a brighter day and of brighter things for the negro.

The chief of the Christian party managed also to offend the King, and this became the signal for the outbreak of a fresh revolution. The Mohammedans attacked the Christians—who were obliged to flee for their lives, two of the chief among the latter being killed. The Mohammedans, supported by the Arabs, were now in the ascendant, new officers of state were appointed, and the missionaries—both French and English—were cast into prison, being after a few days released, and told to leave the country, with the injunction: ""Let no white man come to Buganda for two years. We do not want to see a white teacher back in Buganda till we have converted the whole people to the Mohammedan faith.""\n\nThere is a lesson to be learnt from this case, and what has lately happened to the German East African Company in Zanzibar. In both cases the Arab traders were the instigators, though in the latter case they seem to have had matters simplified for them by the action of the German East African and Imperial authorities. If it be true that the German ships have occasionally been guilty of promiscuously shelling the coast, ""simply to overawe the natives,"" we can hardly wonder at the influence obtained by these Arab traders. In the ordinary way there is not much reason for this alliance between the natives and the Arabs—as the intercourse of the latter is generally confined to kidnapping and enslaving the former. But the presence of a common enemy is sure to drive them into alliance together. And let us remember the native mind does not grasp the difference between one European power and another. It is not in the interests of the Arab to enlighten them—on the contrary, it is clearly to his advantage to persuade them that all Europeans are bent upon their destruction. The Arab influence in East Africa is already immense. The chief obstacle to its further development lies in the hostility of the native tribes, who have trusted Europeans in preference, because they found that these have been just and considerate; but according to latest accounts, the Germans seem bent upon changing all this, and forcing the natives to make common cause with the Arabs.

It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase.

This positive reception and the King's openness to communications with the British Government suggest an improvement in relations, as he expressed a desire for amicable relations with Christian civilization.

In contrast, the General History of Africa does not mention Wilmot's visit or any diplomatic efforts attributed to him, focusing instead on broader European-African interactions, including abolitionist missions and economic shifts in Dahomey.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome.

This was already noticeable in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era. British interests came to be specifically protected visà-vis the interest of other European nationals; British interests were also advanced against those of Africans.

This involvement of both Britain and France in the trade and politics of Lagos and Porto Novo respectively sparked off a spell of dramatic rivalry between the two powers in a bid to control Yorubaland, especially the western parts, and the adjacent Aja-speaking communities.

Its adjustment to changing times was noticeable from the mid-century when, under the influence of a French trading firm, Victor RØgis, King Gezo (c. 1818-58) of Dahomey was persuaded to intensify the trade in palm oil, first as a supplement to the export of slaves and eventually as the dominant factor in the state's export economy.$^{41}$ The transition from slave to 'legi› timate' trade meant a corresponding increase in the need to retain war captives as labour for the maintenance and expansion of the palm oil industry.

The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa.

In 1889, the heir to the throne, Prince Kondo, informed the governor of the RiviŁres de Sud, Bayol, that the Fon people would never accept such a situation. In February 1890, Bayol ordered the occupa› tion of Cotonou and the arrest of all the Fon notables in the town. Prince Kondo, who had begun his reign in December 1889 under the name of Behanzin, reacted by mobilizing his troops. At the time, Abomey had a permanent army which, in peacetime, numbered 4000 men and women. In wartime military service was compulsory for all males, supported by the Amazons, who were dreaded female warriors.\nThe French garrison was attacked at dusk, at the same time as part of the army dispatched to the region of Porto Novo set about destroying the palm trees. According to Behanzin, those economic counter-measures quickly induced the French to sue for peace. On 3 October, Father DorgŁre presented himself in Abomey with proposals for peace. In return for the recognition of Cotonou as a French possession and the right of the French to levy custom duties and station a garrison of troops there, the French were to pay Behanzin an annuity of 20000 francs. The king accepted these terms and the treaty was signed on 3 October 1890. However, to defend the rest of his state, the king started to modernize his army. Between January 1891 and August 1892 he purchased, '1,700 rapid-firing rifles, six Krupp cannon of various bore, five machine-guns, 400,000 assorted cartridges and a large quantity of shell'$^{31}$ from German firms operating in Lome."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Cameroon coast and its hinterland 14', 'content': ""The richest and best known of the Bimbia merchant princes was Bile, known to the Europeans as King William.

In 1833, Bile was able to convince the British representative in Fernando Po, Colonel Nicolls, to recognize him as king of the entire coastal region from Bimbia to Rio del Rey, including its offshore Bubi islands, in return for ceding the same region to Britain as a protectorate. Although the British rejected the voluntary cession, Bile retained the title of king until his death in 1879. The separate polities of Duala and Bimbia thus developed ties in the nineteenth century. Cultural ties were reinforced by Jengu solidarity, as well as by King William's part-Duala ancestry. In commerce, Bimbia and Bell Town traders co-operated in developing the trade of the Rio del Rey area. They developed two major routes. First was the coastal route through the creeks linking the two areas, much as is still the case today. Some Bimbia and Duala traders resided at different villages along the route to receive goods for exchange with the local people. Second was the overland route which served as an alternative when stormy weather and rough seas made the creek route unsafe. This route round Mount Cameroon also tapped the resources of ivory.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858.

In some cases the dominant class emerged stronger as a result of economic and military ties to the slave-traders. Consider relations between the Bemba rulers and the Arab and Swahili traders. Under the leadership of Chileshe Chipela the Bemba had just completed a phase of territorial expansion and political centralization when the foreign traders entered their homeland around i860. As a result, the Bemba kingdom was far more unified and powerful than most states in the region. The geographical position of the Bemba, somewhat removed from the principal trade routes, precluded the growth of a large and potentially seditious merchant community within the core of their kingdom. Equally important, there was no incentive for the Arab and Swahili traders to adopt a hostile posture since the Bemba were not economic rivals. Most of the royal families' wealth came from raiding and tribute in the form of ivory and slaves and they were happy to exchange them for the cloth and other imported goods provided by the coastal merchants. This economic complementarity fostered a harmonious relationship and simultaneously enhanced the internal position of the Bemba aristocracy, which used the foreign commodities to recruit new followers and strengthen their links to subordinate chiefs. The continued demand for captives and ivory also fuelled a new expansionist phase from i860 to 1880, during which Bemba forces conquered most of contemporary north-eastern Zambia. Thus, through ties to foreign merchants, the Bemba rulers gained unprecedented regional power while accumulating a substantial amount of wealth. 43 As in the case of the Bemba, other local chiefs and merchants entered into alliances with the slave-traders that proved extremely beneficial. Throughout the 1870s the Chewa chief, Mwase Kasungu, whose territory straddled the Lake Malawi-Katanga trade route, provided food for the Arab caravans in exchange for guns. These weapons enabled him to withstand the subsequent Mbwela Nguni invasions.$^{44}$ Economic con› siderations also motivated Arab and Swahili protection of the Senga chiefs, who were important suppliers of ivory.$^{45}$ Similar factors help explain Chikunda alliances with the Ambo against the Bemba, and assistance that they provided the Nsenga against the Soli, which occurred in the decade preceding the 'Scramble'.$^{46}$ In all these cases, it is clear that the aliens' strategy was to prevent"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.616, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Somalia', 'section_title': 'The unifying efforts of Emperor TØwodros II > Conflict with Britain', 'content': ""News that the consul had been forbidden to leave Ethiopia had mean› while alarmed the British government.

The former has been very highly received.\n\nThis year being ""The Lorsing,"" or Horse Custom, the usual shade has been made, and to each of the poles that hold up this shade—as I wrote you some time ago—men to be killed for this custom are bound. But one great consolation: instead of using men alone for this custom, the King made use of half of the number, and put actually horses between the men—i.e., one horse after a man; but only the men were killed—he spared the horses! This reduction of men was not caused by insufficiency of men; but God has been directing things in that way, and who knows whether the talk of Commodore Wilmot had something to do with this change? Hence, Mr. Editor, you see the necessity of not neglecting any means necessary towards that object which Christian England has in view with the King of Dahomey, for some good will come out, if proper trial be made. The King of Dahomey is very well disposed towards England; and if that Christian country use all her efforts, what may appear difficult for him to see now in the object of his best friend, the Queen of England, those kind efforts will force him to see; and this is evident from the change of feelings which the visit of Commodore Wilmot has brought about in the few months past. Before this visit we could hear nothing good of the English; nothing but abuse and every attempt to oppose any English movements in his country. We who bear the name of ""English people"" have had a great deal of trouble, but now there is nothing of the kind; every respect is paid to the English people, as the King\'s best friends.\n\nWe are expecting Captain Burton up from Fernando Po to go up to Abomey, Her Majesty\'s ship Antelope having left this station for him.

The Commodore had been waiting some days, expecting the arrival of Mr. Consul Burton (who is charged with a mission to the King of Dahomey), in Her Majesty\'s ship Antelope, from Fernando Po; the Commodore being desirous that Mr. Consul Burton should land with all possible honours, under salute from the Rattlesnake, &c. On the morning of the 4th, three messengers, who had been sent down from Abomey by the King expressly with that object, were conveyed on board the Rattlesnake. The messengers were bearers of the King\'s stick, and charged to compliment the Commodore on his arrival, as well as to present him with a bullock, a goat, some fowls, yams, &c. The King\'s greeting to Commodore Wilmot was ""To his best friend!""\n\nOur correspondent, who had gone on board the Rattlesnake to see the interview, &c., informs us that the scene at the time of the presentation of the ""stick"" was very interesting. None of these people, nor anybody belonging to the King, had ever ventured to go upon the sea before. The compliment was therefore so much the greater, as it was an entire departure from the customs of the country, as hitherto observed. All who have the pleasure of knowing Commodore Wilmot personally, will know how very much is implied when our correspondent says that he received the messengers, with their presents, in a most kind, considerate, and gentlemanly manner. He conducted them all over the ship, and showed, and, as far as possible, explained to them all about her engines. These last were objects of their unbounded admiration and astonishment. These, they said, ""never could have been made by man;"" and added that if any one on shore could have explained such things as those, they would never have been believed. An Armstrong gun was fired for them. This they declared carried the shot six miles—i.e., a distance equal to six English miles. The Commodore feasted them well, made them some handsome presents, and gave them a sufficiency of good wine, and sent them on shore in high good humour. Our correspondent, who saw them afterwards, says that they were too much amazed and delighted with everything that the King\'s best friend, ""the king of the ships,"" had shown them, that they did not know how to express themselves, but went back to Abomey full of wonder and admiration, to tell the King all that they had seen and heard.\n\nThe Commodore, our friend says, sent a good preparatory message to the King, advising him most earnestly, as a friend, to listen to all that Captain Burton would have to say to him. We cannot help thinking that this happy visit on board such a ship as the Rattlesnake will have produced an impression that may greatly aid Captain Burton\'s persuasions, and tend to incline the King to such a change as we desire.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1864#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'My impression is, that England may, by a dignified and generous liberality, in offering the King of Dahomey a bonus for the loss of the pecuniary advantages of the slave-trade; and by assisting him in a well-organised system of cotton culture throughout the country, save an enormous outlay of treasure and of blood, in otherwise hostile movements; secure permanent peace between Dahomey and Abeokuta, and add a fertile region and a hardy, industrious population to her world-wide cotton fields.\n\nIn concluding this too brief and hastily-written letter—considering the moral and political magnitude of the subject—I beg to urge upon your attention a suggestion to which I attach considerable importance. Should Commodore Wilmot have happily succeeded, and, contingent thereupon, should the Government intend to establish in Dahomey any consular or other kind of agency, pray exert your utmost efforts to secure its entire independence of all local authority, and its direct intercourse with the Home Government. The King of Dahomey would not esteem himself honoured by having intercourse only with an authority subordinate to some other on the coast, neither could an agency so situated maintain that dignified position in Dahomey which circumstances would require and demand.\n\nI have been told that the delay in Commodore Wilmot\'s visit to Dahomey arose from his refusing to go unless he could act independently of the authority of the senior officer of the squadron on the coast; and although the delay caused thereby is to be regretted, yet he was, I think, fully justified in the course he adopted.

We are glad, therefore, to have this confirmation of the soundness of our views in urging Her Majesty\'s Government, as the African-Aid Society has done, to send a consul to Whydah.\n\nOur correspondent says that he agrees entirely with what he has heard to be the opinions of Commodore Wilmot, who visited Dahomey in December and January last. He thinks ""that England has not, as a nation, given Dahomey that share of its attention which its peculiar position and circumstances relative to the slave-trade and to Abeokuta has claimed."" ""The more I think,"" he says again, ""of Dahomey, and of Commodore Wilmot\'s recent visit, the more deeply am I impressed with the idea that such a consular establishment as has been suggested is the great desideratum for the present.

It has always strongly recognised her great importance, both as regards the slave-trade—which her conversion to better practices would put an end to in the Bight of Benin—and also as regards the spread and increase of civilising commercial operations on the coast. We firmly believe that the time has nearly come when the great change we so desire, and have so ardently striven to procure, will take place in Dahomey.

The African-Aid Society have especially reason to congratulate themselves on the justness of their views with regard to Dahomey. It is now more than two years since they memorialised Her Majesty's Government to send a commissioner to the King of that country. Although assailed on all sides by doubts as to the personal safety of any person who might be thus sent, they have never wavered, and at every convenient opportunity have reiterated that request. Their information respecting both King and people was too certain to allow them to participate in any fear. They knew that what the King desired in his heart, above all other things, was, that some Englishman, clothed with command, and bringing a direct message from the British Government, should come to him. His pride and dignity were involved in his obtaining this virtual recognition from England, similar to that which his father had received. Their memorial prayed, moreover, that, if necessary, a subsidy might be granted to the King, to cease whenever legitimate trade should have brought him a revenue equal to that he would have abandoned in giving up and assisting us in destroying the slave-trade, at our request.\n\nThe reception of Commodore Wilmot by the King of Dahomey, his chiefs and people, has set at rest the question of the accessibility of that monarch to the remonstrances and counsels of England. Our prestige there is very great. All were jealous of the preference which we seemed to give to Abeokuta. That envenomed the feelings of the Dahomans against the Abeokutans, and the very decided terms in which the former spoke to Commodore Wilmot on the subject show that there is but little chance of peace between the two until the issues of another foray into the Egba country shall have been tried. We deeply deplore that Commodore Wilmot could not obtain an abandonment of the King's designs against Abeokuta. But, notwithstanding the state of isolation from England in which the Abeokutans have placed themselves, by their unjustifiable and offensive rejection of Mr. Vice-Consul Taylor, and their subsequent proceedings, they ought to be perfectly able to protect their town against troops on whom a three weeks' march without commissariat supplies must tell with most enfeebling effect."", 'last_edit_date': '1863-03-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1863#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'DAHOMEY, ENGLAND, AND ABEOKUTA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In the absence of any letter from our Dahomey correspondent, or from Commodore Wilmot, the non-receipt of which we deplore, we especially call our readers\' attention to one dated from the Gold Coast. It is from a person most intimately acquainted with the King and people of Dahomey, and whose evidence respecting them is entitled to great weight. From what we have heard respecting the late embassy we are convinced that the day is at hand when Dahomey will put aside her most flagrant iniquities, and enter resolutely on the path of industrial development. We have so often alluded to her rich and varied resources, that we need not enumerate them here. We shall merely say *en passant*, that there is no doubt she could be a great cotton producer. Why, then, should she not be? We do not hesitate to assert, that if she does not speedily become so it will be our own fault. We are convinced that all will now depend upon prompt and liberal action on the part of Her Majesty\'s Government. The King and people are warm towards us. We must not allow this new-born affection to cool, much less to be extinguished. We hope that immediate preparations will be made for Commodore Wilmot\'s return to Abomey within a short time, and with such presents as he knows that the King desires—presents that will give fresh *éclat* to his mission, and confirm the good impression he has already made. And there can be no doubt that the Government ought to be prepared for immediate action after the Commodore\'s next visit, in making which he must be furnished with ample instructions and powers. We must state it to be our present opinion, that for a rapid and safe change of system in Dahomey it will be both kind to the King, and indispensable to success, that we should act upon his suggestion, if it be repeated, and occupy Whydah.

What remain of the Ishagga prisoners are now employed in agriculture or otherwise in Dahomey, but all doomed to slaughter, unless we come forward in their rescue.

A messenger of the King of Dahomey went to him from Whydah, with special directions to see the Commodore *with his own eyes.* The following is the substance of the message he was charged to deliver: ""The King sends his best regards to the Commodore, and wishes him to come to Abomey. He does not like Captain Burton, and would not make a treaty with him, after having refused his friend the Commodore. The King will tell the Commodore all he wants, if he will come up to Abomey, and will send a message to the Queen of England.""\n\nAs on a previous occasion, the messenger was extremely well received by Commodore Wilmot, who, however, according to our informant, returned a rather severe, though wise and conciliatory, reply. It is understood to have been to this effect:—\n\n""Tell the King that I am glad to hear he is well, and give him my compliments. Tell him further that it is not likely the English Government will send another messenger to Abomey, because the King\'s conduct is not such as to prove that he is sincere. Presents have been made to him, and offers of friendship have been held out to him, with a real desire on the part of England to benefit Dahomey and Africa. We cannot go on in this ridiculous way. The King must give up the slave-trade, or he must prepare to see his ports blockaded, which must very soon have the desired effect, because all those things which are absolutely necessary to him now will be prevented from reaching the shore. He cannot live or feed his people without those things. He will not be able to sell his slaves, because they cannot be shipped. His wars with Abeokuta and others are consuming the strength of his kingdom, because many are killed, many made prisoners, many die—and who can replace them. If I stop his supplies, how can he exist? There is no cultivation and no produce of the soil. He and his people will starve, and his kingdom will be broken up. Tell him that all the kings and tribes round Dahomey are his enemies, and that if once the English blockade his coast they will be glad of the opportunity to rise against him and destroy him. Perhaps Abeokuta will do this. Who can say? Be sure you tell the King truly all that I have said, and that the advice of his best friend is that he should at once send his principal chiefs to Whydah, and make the treaty with me that the Queen of England requires.""\n\nOur correspondent says that the messenger acknowledged that all the Commodore had said was true—and there can be no doubt that he will faithfully report every word of it to the King.

In this number of our journal we have also to record the painful news of an active foreign slave-trade at Whydah—of the shipment of nearly 1,000 poor wretches in one steamer, destined for the disgusting shambles of the modern plantations of Cuba, there to be used up in eight or ten years in the production of sugar for the British market. We cannot forget that, on those 1,000 slaves alone, the King obtains a fancied profit of some 10,000l., which we enable the Cuban planters to send him, through the slave-traders, for the supply of the raw material out of which they manufacture sugar for us. We are compelled to bear in mind that at the rate of duty he levies on palm oil shipped at Whydah—viz., one dollar per puncheon—there must be a very large exportation of produce to compensate him for relinquishing the slave-trade. We have also recently obtained a new insight into the dreadful ""Customs"" of Dahomey—of the supposed obligation on the part of the monarch to continue them during his life; and Aboekuta, though a hard nut, perhaps, to crack, has in its numerous population a delicious kernel for the wholesale butcher and slave-dealer. Nevertheless, we hail with joy this manifestation on the part of the King of a desire to enter into some amicable relations with the Christian civilization of this country. And we do indeed earnestly hope that advantage will be taken of it by Her Majesty\'s Government. We stated in our last that Commodore A. Eardley Wilmott had been furnished by them with the presents that would be requisite should he attempt a visit to Abomey. And we know his earnest desire to detach the King of Dahomey from the slave-trade. We have, therefore, reason to believe that when he receives, by the mail which leaves Liverpool to-morrow, this interesting intelligence, which has been communicated through us, he will lose no time but proceed to Whydah as soon as his other duties will permit. The King asks for the light to be brought to him; and such a desire ought to be immediately gratified. It may be only curiosity on his part, or a desire for the presents which he well knows he will receive; or to raise himself still higher in the opinion of his people, through that acknowledgment of him as king by this great nation; or it may be only a ruse on his part, to lull the Aboekutans into a fancied security, so that they may become an easier prey. Still, his desire ought to be complied with; the wishes, and, if necessary, the demands, of this Christian country ought to be diplomatically placed before him. The person whom he has named as interpreter should accompany the British negotiator. And then, should all fail—should no good result be obtained—we shall have at least the satisfaction that we performed our duty. We are not sanguine of any immediate good result, because we have no reason to believe that the negotiator has any power to promise a subsidy on the part of this country, which might compensate (until legitimate commerce should be largely developed) for the fancied pecuniary loss the King would sustain by the abandonment of the slave-trade. But we might expect to learn the amount of subsidy that would induce such abandonment; and it would then be for this country to determine whether it would be our duty or our interest to pay the price.', 'last_edit_date': '1862-12-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1862#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.697, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LATEST FROM DAHOMEY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Under date of October 3rd, Mr. Bernasko reports to the Committee of the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society his safe return to Whydah, on the 22nd of September, from another visit to Abomey.\n\nThe details of the cruelties witnessed by Mr. Bernasko are, as usual, sickening; but his expostulations with the King were apparently fruitless. Had his father abolished these evil practices, his Majesty said, he would not have resumed them; but as they had not been abolished previously to his entering on the kingdom, he could not venture to set them aside.\n\nMr. Bernasko was much interested in the fate of the remaining captives taken at Ishagga, and hoped to obtain their release; but was informed that they had died from the effects of their diet while in captivity. He put his own construction on this story.\n\nOne hopeful circumstance, however, appeared. The King seemed wishful to receive communications from the Government of England, and disappointed that those which had been opened with his father had not been continued. There seems reason to think that a properly-accredited messenger would not be unwelcome; and should the duties of his mission be judiciously discharged, it is possible that much good might result. The subject deserves the best consideration of Her Majesty\'s Government, with a view to some immediate action that might be instrumental in averting the threatened attack from Abeokuta. The King said that the Queen of England was great among the white people, while he, the King, was great among the black. The King had on a former occasion allowed Mr. Bernasko to take half-a-dozen children from Abomey to Whydah to educate.

It seemed to us so advisable in the interests of African civilisation that he should be not only allowed, but encouraged and assisted to do so, that we have strenuously advocated the measure. In our May number we made some comments on a letter of the late Commodore on the West Coast station; in which, in pursuance, as we believed of orders from home, the King of Dahomey\'s request was refused. Our correspondence from Dahomey shows us, however, that the King has not accepted this reply of the Commodore as a final decision against him, but has applied directly by letter to Her Majesty\'s Government with the same object. In the article in our May number before alluded to we exposed the error and inconsistency of such a refusal as had been given to the King, and endeavoured once again to show how much that change which we so desire for Dahomey and Ashantee might possibly be forwarded by bringing some of the chief men of those countries into immediate personal contact with our advanced civilisation and all the humane institutions to which the blessed precepts of the Gospel of Peace have given rise among us. There is nothing more necessary to be shown to the authorities of those barbarous countries than the value which we attach to human life; and that although unhappily wars have not ceased among so-called Christian nations, human life is, except upon the battle-field, regarded as a sacred thing, in no case to be wantonly taken away, and in all cases to be hedged round by the supreme authority with all possible protections. We do not know what may be the decision of our Government, and what answer may be sent to the King of Dahomey. We have reason, however, to believe that the arguments put forward by us have not been without effect in modifying opinions in quarters where opposition to the King of Dahomey\'s wishes was known to exist. There is consequently reason to hope that a favourable answer may be accorded, at least to the extent of meeting the King\'s wishes that some of his chiefs should come over to this country, by offering those facilities without which it would be difficult, if not impossible, for them to do so. This, and a formal reception of such envoys by Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, are two very different things. If the latter could by any possibility be construed into an approval of, or even into a cessation of protest against, those horrible barbarities by which Dahomey is polluted, especially in those superstitious ""Customs"" in which human life is so wantonly destroyed, we should say at once that such envoys should not be admitted, either formally or informally, to the Royal presence; but if, as we think there is reason to believe, the personal displeasure of our Sovereign at such atrocities, pronounced by herself in presence of those envoys, might have the effect of inducing the King to put an end at once and for ever to his slave wars and to those appalling ""Customs"" for which Dahomey has become so infamously distinguished, we do venture to express the hope that in the event of the envoys arriving here, some means may be devised by which they may thus become assured of Her Majesty\'s abhorrence of things in which the Kings of Dahomey have delighted, and that Her Majesty considers those things in which they have gloried as incompatible with the existence of any friendly understanding, or interchange of courtesies between herself and him. We do think that some means may be devised by which such a Royal Christian effort might be made in the cause of humanity and of Christian civilisation in Africa without any sacrifice of Royal dignity. The end in view is really a great one. The cessation of slave-hunting wars and of ""Customs"" in Dahomey, and the entry of that country, however feeble at first its steps may be, into the ranks of the world\'s advancing Christian civilisation, would have a great effect on the surrounding countries. A new way would be opened through Dahomey into the interior of Africa. And as the Dahoman Government has long since shown itself alive to the importance of good roads between its principal places, more might possibly be done within a short time in that than in any other native African country in establishing improved communications between the coast and the interior. The visit of the Dahoman envoys to this country, and their judicious reception and entertainment here, are therefore much to be desired. It would be absurd, of course, to bring them over at this time of the year, when they would be exposed to the rigours of winter; but we hope that such an answer may be given to the King\'s application, and such instructions be issued and arrangements made, as may lead to the presence of those men among us some time in the months of May or June of next year.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-09-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_09_1866#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.717, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'DAHOMEY: ITS KING AND PEOPLE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""trade and revenue of Lagos.

We were, therefore, glad to see, and we congratulate Sir William Hewett, that there was so strong an expression on both sides in the House of Lords that there could not be any withdrawal of our just demands; and that if his Majesty of Dahomey continue intractable, effective measures should be adopted. Some sort of apprehension has been felt that should it become necessary to proceed to extremities with King Gelélé, there would be something like a renewal of preparations such as preceded the march of our soldiers to Coomassie. But this is a mistake. Abomey is much more easy of access from the coast than is Coomassie. Instead of being 190 miles from Whydah, or from Porto Novo, as Coomassie is from Cape Coast Castle, Abomey, the capital of Dahomey—where the King usually resides, and where the sacrificial atrocities are committed—is not much, if any, more than ninety miles from Whydah or Porto Novo. Unlike Ashanti, which is so densely wooded, Dahomey is, for the most part, an open country; while the roads for many miles around Abomey are broad and good—have been represented, indeed, by European visitors as fully equal to the best English high roads. There is only one difficulty, in the shape of a swamp, through which the paths are narrow, and which is almost impassable during the rainy season; but any advance into the interior on our part would not be made during that season, and the swamp, we believe, may be turned, without any great increase of distance to be traversed. As regards forces, those of Dahomey are not fit in any way to be put in comparison with those of Ashanti which were encountered during the march on Coomassie. With the exception of his Amazons, the King of Dahomey has very few dependable troops, while neither Amazons nor the others are fit to stand five minutes against the well-trained Houssas which we could now send against them, to say nothing of the few hundred blue jackets that the Fleet would furnish. Like the Ashantees, the Dahomans have neither artillery nor rocket tubes, and could not at all contend with such formidable weapons. Our own impression is that in the event of an advance on Abomey, there would be very little bloodshed. With the exception of those who constitute the armed force of Dahomey, the country groans under a tyranny from which it would gladly embrace an opportunity to escape. The Dahomans proper conquered the territories over which they now tyrannize; and the heavy blood tribute they have demanded from the people, with other exactions of the most galling nature, especially those connected with the formation and maintenance of the privileged Amazon corps, has prevented the growth of any real attachment between the governing power and its subjects; and it would not in any way surprise us should the advance of British forces on Abomey, with one defeat of the King's army, be the signal for a general rising of the agricultural population, to wreak their just vengeance on oppressors whose sins against humanity have been of so deep a dye. By the order published in the Gazette of the 23rd May, the blockade of the Dahoman ports by Her Majesty's ships, under the command of Sir William Hewett, will commence on the 1st of July, should the fine imposed by the Commodore not be previously paid. We do not think that the extension of time for payment (the blockade was to have begun on the 1st of June) will bring any additional advantages to the King. There is time, it is true, for the steamer which left Liverpool on Saturday last to land cargo at Whydah, and the other ports mentioned in the Government notice, before the blockade will commence. Merchants, however, we should think—even including Messrs. Regis, of Marseilles—will be more anxious about the safety or safe removal of property they may now have on shore there than to incur the risk of increasing their ventures within the Dahoman territory. We approve, therefore, on every ground of the extension of time thus accorded. It may save the property of British merchants by giving them longer time for its sale or removal; it gives the King longer opportunity for reflection, which, however, as we have above said, we hope he will not be wise enough to turn to good account for his own safety; while, if ulterior measures become necessary, it will enable all requisite arrangements to be made, so that everything shall be in readiness in October, when the rains will have ceased, and the country have pretty well recovered from their effects so far as regards its condition to be traversed by an armed force. We shall now wait the arrival of successive steamers from the Coast with greatly increased interest, but at the same time with a feeling of certainty that whatever may be the course pursued by the King, the blockading squadron, or a subsequent expedition, the ultimate result of the present difficulty will be the creation of additional facilities for the spread of Christian civilization within territories where the blackest rites of the most blood-thirsty of superstitions have been hitherto practised without intermission, hindrance, or remorse."", 'last_edit_date': '1876-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1876#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'DAHOMEY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The latest news from Dahomey brought by the Roquelle steamship, which arrived at Liverpool on the 24th of August, is not of a nature to allay the apprehensions of those who have feared that a ""little war"" might be the result of the fine imposed on the King of Dahomey by Sir William Hewett. We are not of those who had thus feared, but of those who, looking to the future welfare of Dahomey itself, as well as of the countries bordering upon it, have rather hoped that the King would be infatuated enough to give cause for operations against him that would destroy at once and for ever a rule that daily outrages humanity, and is a bitter curse to all that portion of West Africa over which its desolating influence extends. The atrocities committed at Abomey and the desolating kidnapping annual expeditions into neighbouring territories which supply the victims, are not results of the personal character of any one individual Dahoman king, but the unvarying results of a system which will endure so long as the Dahoman rule is continued. On the ground of humanity alone it would well become the British Government to put an end at once and for ever to that rule; but we are not so Quixotic as to suppose for a moment that this could possibly happen. We therefore looked with pleasure on the complications that arose at Whydah, owing to the application of a diluted specimen of Dahoman barbarity to a British subject, who happened to be not so absorbingly a trader as to sink all sense of personal dignity for the sake of pounds, shillings, and pence; but complained of the treatment to which he had been subjected, and appealed to his own Government for redress. The Commodore (Sir William Hewett), as representing that Government, inflicted a fine on Dahomey which we felt convinced the King\'s besotted ignorance and pride would not allow him to pay, or rather order to be paid. The news now brought, justifies thus far our view of the case. The British Government, in most properly sanctioning and adopting the decision of their Commodore, have now gone so far that they cannot recede, but must go much further if the King should continue to brave their power. We hope they will not be deterred by any unfounded apprehension of meeting with a repetition of the difficulties and obstacles which had to be encountered in the advance on the capital of Ashanti. Abomey is only half the distance from the coast that had to be traversed to arrive at Coomassie, or Kumasi; while the country is comparatively open, and, with the exception of a limited tract of swamp (which need not necessarily be traversed, but may be skirted), presents really no obstacles to a rapid march on the capital. Nor is the opposing force, however terrible it may be to neighbouring peoples comparatively unarmed, either in number or quality such as could stand before even a very small number of British soldiers and sailors armed with weapons and accompanied by artillery which modern science has made so terribly destructive. The war, if there be a war, will be a very little one, and very speedily terminated; while the prize to be obtained is one of considerable magnitude, and one that must necessarily, sooner or later, be obtained, because it is indispensable to the beneficial progress of British civilizing rule in West Africa. We may be excused for again reminding our readers that when the Gold Coast Colony, as now administratively existing, was constituted by proclamation after the conclusion of the Ashanti War, we recorded at once our conviction that although there was not any such intention in the minds of the British Government, the inevitable result must be the bringing within the Protectorate of what a writer in the Standard, who has adopted our views, justly designates ""little wrecking, smuggling kinglets"" intervening between our actual Gold Coast territory and Whydah, and the further subjection of the entire seaboard thence to Lagos. The Gold Coast Colony will thenceforward, whenever this absorption has taken place, show commercial and financial results which will astonish those who have been accustomed to oppose all territorial acquisitions in West Africa as worthless and unproductive of aught but trouble. The period of development of a large extent of territory will then fairly commence. Dahomey, once freed from the oppressing, withering rule of its present Government, will offer large results to trade and commerce, Lagos will take high rank in trade, and the Gold Coast Colony revenues will be such as will allow of the construction of works such as have been found effective in other countries for stimulating and increasing production. It will be a great mistake not to make the most of the opportunity which the King of Dahomey now affords the British Government of a profitable extension of territorial rule. There is one point, however, to which we hope due attention will be given should an advance by British forces on Abomey become necessary. The advance would be incalculably facilitated by a public pledge on the part of the British Government to annex and occupy the seaboard as we have suggested. The Whydahs, who have always groaned under the Dahoman yoke, and who even made a movement for emancipation about two years ago, would at once unite their efforts with those of the invading force, if they were certain that they would not subsequently be again handed over to the Dahomans. We could not expect them to give aid and assistance under any other conditions. Since they fell to the Dahomans by conquest, they have realized, alas! but too fully, the weight of their exterminating oppressed people, and later, when they shall have served up.\n**31**', 'last_edit_date': '1876-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1876#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'DAHOMEY: ITS KING AND PEOPLE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The King of Dahomey has not realized the expectations we last month hazarded respecting him. Those expectations were formed on the supposition that he might possess some few grains of common sense, which would place vividly before his mental vision the dangers of collision between an earthen pot and a sledge hammer wielded by an arm of power. It seems to be now past dispute that, instead of disowning the acts of the brutal authorities at Whydah, who showed themselves to be fit servants to such a master, he has put a bold front on the matter, and sent the insolent message that ""he will pay the Commodore in powder and bullets if he will come up to Abomey."" This is the language that might be expected only from a doomed idiot, vapouring among the spiritless slaves by whom he may be surrounded, and who have worshipped him as almost a god, until he believes himself to be quite one. It is clearly full time that both King and people should be undeceived by coming in rude contact with something more than a few European trading clerks and agents, who, naturally enough, in the interests of their trade, submit, uncomplainingly, to everything short of actual plunder and brutal violence. Our opinions and feelings respecting the frantic iniquity of Dahomey are so strong, and our conviction that it is the imperative duty of Great Britain, as the real protecting Power on the West Coast of Africa, to put a final end to its enormities as being a daily insult to humanity, is so unalterable, that all we can say in reply to the braggart King is that we hope he will continue in his present frame of mind, and not be moved to feigned repentance by the blockade of his sea-ports. We do not wish him to repent, and thus save himself and his authority from destruction—unless his repentance should go so far (which it never would do) as to secure his faithful acquiescence in British demands, that he should never henceforth make any inroads into Egba territories in search of victims for his atrocious festivals, and that those festivals of blood should be entirely put an end to. The earth has groaned long enough under this blood-thirsty monster, and the devilish system that he at this time represents. That system is incurable by any other means than the entire destruction of the Power with which it is identified, and of which it is an inseparable part. The late King, and the present also, more than once declared to Europeans who have been on missions to Abomey, that even were he desirous of doing so, he could not discontinue that perpetual series of human sacrifices in which his people delight; that his prestige would be gone, and that he in his turn would be a victim if he ceased to justify by deeds his title of ""Man-slayer."" There is possibly truth in this. The people, like their King, are accustomed to sniff the, to them, intoxicating odour of the reeking blood of victims slaughtered before their eyes, and would object to be deprived of a gratification they have so long enjoyed. Under such circumstances there is only one way of purifying the horribly polluted atmosphere of Dahomey, and that is by bringing a superior force to bear upon King, people, and institutions. As already stated, we have ourselves always held the opinion that it was the duty of a civilized Christian Power such as Great Britain to interfere in the interests of humanity. There are now other interests, in addition to those of mere humanity, urging and impelling to the work. Not only has one of her subjects been grievously maltreated, but the financial interests of the Gold Coast Colony are very prejudicially interfered with by the action of Dahomey as a marauding State. The yearly armed expeditions into the Egba territories, even up to the immediate neighbourhood of Abeokuta, in quest of plunder and victims for sacrifice in the ""Customs,"" inflict very great injury not only on the industrious Egba agriculturists, but also, as a necessary result, on the revenues of Lagos. There is an annual scare in the Egba territories. Farms are deserted, the people take refuge in Abeokuta, and their property is wasted and destroyed. We feel sure that we do not exaggerate when we say that were those marauding inroads to cease, and to cease at the absurd certainty that there will not be any renewal of them, agricultural industry will take so great a development in the Egba countries that the production would be doubled, with corresponding advantage to the', 'last_edit_date': '1876-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1876#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

The Society would sell shares or land rights offered by African petitioners but only to Afro-American or African purchasers. 4 Bishop Turner also later served as an adviser to the International Migration Society (IMS) of Alabama, which sent about 500 emigrants to Africa before it became defunct in 1900. Some of the 500 remained in Liberia; others returned to the United States. Those who remained fared reasonably well; evidently more than a few of them prospered. On the other hand, those who returned told horror stories of poor land, inadequate food and poor living conditions. These stories reduced the likelihood of any large-scale Afro-American emigration movement, even though prospects for blacks in the United States were declining from 1895 to 1900. Nevertheless, numerous Afro-Americans evidently continued to give serious consider› ation to African emigration, just as others in the United States and the Caribbean simply moved away from overt discriminatory practices into other regions near by.\nAfter the turn of the twentieth century, the back-to-Africa baton was picked up by others. For example, one Captain Dean, early in the twentieth century, hoped to engineer the settlement of American blacks in South Africa to fashion a powerful black state there. After the briefest sojourn meant to arrange for this settlement, however, white authorities expelled Dean from the Cape for what were termed 'provocative activities'. And in 1914, Chief Alfred C. Sam, a Gold Coast African, turned up in Oklahoma, persuaded about sixty black farmers that Africa offered them greater oppor› tunities and sailed with them to Saltpond in the Gold Coast. Finding Chief Sam's claims to be exaggerated and encountering restrictions from the Gold Coast officials which inhibited the entry of American immigrants, most of the Oklahomans eventually returned to the United States.

Repatriation began in earnest after 1815, however, when a small group of thirty-eight black Americans led by Paul Cuffe returned to Africa. By 1830, Liberia had become the focus for a general colony of repatriated Africans, mostly ex-slaves, sponsored by the American Colonization Society with the financial support of the Federal as well as many State governments.

After the Civil War, less than 2000 settlers made the trip, despite the rapid deterioration of the conditions of life for Afro-Americans in the USA.\nTwo other sources provided returning immigrants. The first came from the unknown number of maroons and Africans taken from confiscated slave ships during the nineteenth century, and shipped back to Africa by the British in their zealous attempt to terminate the trade in slaves and replace it by 'legitimate' trade. The second source of African returnees came from an even smaller number of missionaries recruited in the Caribbean and southern states of the USA, principally by the Moravians and Presby› terians, to assist in the propagation of the Christian Gospel in West Africa. The most well-known example of this is perhaps the Basel Mission enterprise among the Akwapim hills of Ghana in the 1830s and 1840s, and their decision in 1843 to use Jamaicans as substitutes for German and Swiss missionaries whose mortality in the field proved too high for evan› gelical efficacy."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Conclusions', 'content': 'In broad pan-Africanist terms, however, the evidence seems clear that African political and ideological visions were expanded and technical expertise was improved because of colonial African interactions with American blacks. The much-heralded black emigration schemes trumpeted by Garvey, whose ubiquitous publications reached deep into Africa, were only one example of a leitmotif which brought American blacks within the world view of African peoples. The themes of African redemption through American black missionaries were another.\nAfricans themselves, however, created the context of their next interaction with American blacks as they matriculated at American, largely Afro-American, schools and attended pan-African conferences and the like. Consequently, many Africans underwent a technical-educationalpolitical experience alien to their colonial world. When they re-entered their own worlds, many felt driven to resolve questions of ideology, cultural definition, educational values, political power, and pan-African unity or consciousness, guided by new perspectives.\nViewed against such an historical backdrop, the numerous pan-African conferences, Tuskegean educational and technical projects, the nØgritude movement and the occasional focus on American blacks in African millen› nial dreams, all illustrate the consistency of the pan-African theme among American and Caribbean blacks. They also show the variability of African responses to the New World overtures and ultimately the shaping by Africans themselves of these overtures to fit African specifications.\nIn sum, the populations of the African diaspora and the motive charac› terizing the many interactions between persons of the first and second black worlds included two visions. One was a vision of the union of religious forces among black populations in Africa and America or the reconstruction of Africa through importation of American and Antillean black technical expertise, initiated at the behest of American blacks.

Repatri› ation during the nineteenth century offered few material rewards for Europeans or non-Europeans. But by 1900, the divergence between Africa and the Americas had become too great. Persons of African descent became caught up in the self-consciousness of the age which produced the type of xenophobic nationalism that all but destroyed the appeal of Africa. More› over, the interest in Africa after the end of the slave trade grew from national lusts for power and wealth - and Afro-Americans lacked both political power and the wealth needed to stimulate their own interest, or influence those who were partitioning Africa into colonial spheres. The Afro-American view became focused more on the new developments within their hemisphere. Internal and inter-regional migrations and the quest to establish the good life against new deleterious challenges absorbed their attention. The African connection faded, but did not die. The return-toAfrica movement found individual promoters who could occasionally infuse the movement with new appeal. In 1897, Henry Sylvester Williams, a Trinidadian-born lawyer living in London, founded the Pan-African Association, whose later membership would include George Padmore, Kwame Nkrumah and C. L. R. James. In the 1920s Marcus Garvey founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association, a movement designed to spur African decolonization and unite all Africans wherever they were found.

Only African populations of certain regions were initially involved in inter› action with American and Caribbean blacks. Those regions involved early in our period were the ones which became the focus of American black emigration or evangelism, particularly West Africa, South Africa, and the Horn. Peoples of other regions became involved because of the penetration of their region by pan-Africanist projects, American black writings, folk› lore, and the like, or more importantly, because of the initiatives of school leavers who went, in growing numbers from all over the African continent, to America for higher education.\nPerspectives were undoubtedly affected by direct and substantial inter› action of Africans within a particular black environment or set of influences. Exactly how much is anybody's guess. The effect of colonial African experience with American blacks appears, nevertheless, unique and vital in terms of subsequent social and political activities. For some, the American black component within African nationalist ideology and strategies emerging during the colonial period was striking and unequivocal. In the view of others, for example some African students, interactions within American black arenas were disappointing and unrewarding. The caustic assessment of one such visitor illustrates the latter point: 'One of the things I had decided to find out during my stay in America was the condition of the descendants of former slaves brought here from Africa ... I feel safe in saying that, so far as economic and material progress are concerned the Negro in America is on the average ahead of the West African, but when it comes to integrity and genuine manhood, the American Negro is far below him.' 75 Another view was that many Afro-American missionaries who viewed Africans as 'poor heathen savages' must bear some of the responsibility for perpetuating a distorted and pernicious picture of Africa and Africans in the minds of their fellow American blacks. In other words, in their sedulous campaign to recruit American black workers for foreign missions, missionary churches undoubtedly succumbed occasionally to the tempta- tion of portraying an exotic, erotic and socially inferior Africa much in need of great sacrifice, hard work, and alien redemption."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Back-to-Africa movements', 'content': ""A black rabbi, Arnold Ford, from Barbados (via New York) emigrated to Ethiopia in 1930 and entertained in the Tambourine Club with Negro spirituals before it was 'closed down by the government for discriminating against local Ethiopian clients'.$^{9}$ While in Harlem, Ford became attracted to Garvey's message. It seems, therefore, that although the UNIA depu› tation failed to establish organizational links with the Horn of Africa as with Liberia, it did succeed in orienting a number of prospective American black emigrants towards service there. Possibly more individual Garveyites emigrated to Ethiopia than to Liberia. For despite its greater inaccessi› bility, Ethiopia's antiquity and grandeur might have 'exercised a stronger pull than the bourgeois' - and to Garvey's mind - 'anti-African politics of the Americo-Liberian ruling elite'.$^{10}$ Thus, when Garvey broke openly with the Liberian government, evidently many of his adherents looked fondly toward this new horizon."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Pan-Africanism: political and cultural aspects', 'content': ""However, despite sectarian criticism of himself and of the UNIA, Garvey became the focus of much pan-Africanist interest in the United States, the Caribbean, West Africa, East Africa, Central Africa and, most of all, Southern Africa between 1916 and the mid-ig30s. Indeed, by the end of the First World War, Garvey's militant newspaper, The Negro World under the editorship of Hubert Harrison, a Caribbean journalist living in New York - struck a responsive chord among the black masses in New York, throughout North America, and in Africa. Garvey's message to all was: organize, buy black, support the Black Star Steamship Line (which could take black emigrants to Africa and bring back raw materials), and help drive whites out of Africa. He stressed that: We are the descendants of a suffering people. We are the descendants of a people determined to suffer no longer ... We do not desire what has belonged to others, though others have always sought to deprive us of that which belonged to us ... The other races have countries of their own and it is time for the 400,000,000 Negroes [of the world] to claim Africa for themselves. 55 Whereas Du Bois was a greater pan-African force among black intellectuals outside Africa, and Washington was better known among rural artisan classes, Garvey's influence fell equally upon the submerged black masses of all strata both outside and inside Africa. Garvey received much of his own pan-Africanist inspiration from the Egyptian intellectual, Duse Muhammad Ali, while in England in 1912 and from reading, also in London, Washington's autobiography, Up From Slavery.\nInitially organized around the idea of setting up a Tuskegee-type school in Jamaica, Garvey's UNIA became the organizational link between large numbers of Africans and American blacks outside Africa, and, through The Negro World, achieved substantial pan-African effect within Africa. Between 1920 and 1938, eight UNIA conventions were held. The first five, with Garvey in charge, were held in New York City in August of each year from 1920 to 1924, the next two, following Garvey's deportation from the United States, took place in Jamaica in 1929 and 1934, and the eighth and last, in Canada, in 1938."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Pan-Africanism: political and cultural aspects', 'content': ""Besides these educational exchanges, a series of pan-Africanist organizations and conferences, as well as commercial and literary or cultural activities 47.

The reputation and resources of Tuskegee, however, were brought to Africa by African and American alumni and, often, by numerous African visitors to Tuskegee or correspondents with Washington who had never been matriculated students. Consequently, through the media of numerous international conferences, visitations, and technical missions, many Africans were touched by the 'Tuskegee Spirit' or drew upon Tuskegee's and other American black resources."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Back-to-Africa movements', 'content': ""However, while some American blacks who emigrated to Ethiopia in and after the 1920s were motivated generally by Garvey, the immediate trigger for their actions might have been a chance meeting with Ethiopian students or contact with the occasional Ethiopian delegation that went to New York in the late 1920s 'to solicit trained Negro Colonists for Africa'. 1 1 Moreover, Ford, like Bishop Turner, believed that American blacks bore a special redemptive role vis-à-vis Africa based on their years of suffering and exile. Ford himself answered such a call by a delegation of Fälasa (black Ethiopian Jews) and left for Ethiopia in 1930 where he evidently remained until his death during the time of the Italian-Ethiopian War (1935-6).$^{I2}$ The majority of the American emigrants Ford encountered in Ethiopia when he arrived there were Jamaicans, and, occasionally, other Afro-Caribbean folk. A recent account suggests that 'the West Indians appear to have been more prepared than some of the Americans to make what adjustments were necessary to living in Ethiopia' although both groups suffered discrimination from time to time. 1 3 Of course, even before Garvey's time, other American blacks had emigrated to Ethiopia, but as individual settlers. For example, in the 1890s Benito Sylvain, a Haitian, brought to the Court of Menelik II a plan for a 'Pan-Negro' organization. Clearly, however, the largest waves of American black immigrants came in the late 1920s and early 1930s, that is, after Garvey's break with the Liberians and through the time of the Emperor's accession, with the greatest numbers of these responding to meetings with Ethiopian travellers. In the period immediately following the restoration of Haile Sellassie in 1941, a new trickle of Afro-Americans (possibly twenty) came to Ethiopia. The period, however, falls beyond the scope of this chapter. Suffice it to say that the numbers of black immigrants from the Americas to Ethiopia peaked during activities associated with Garvey, Ford and the Emperor and were not equalled before or after that era. 14"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The impact of Africa', 'content': 'Where they could - and where they had no other recourse - Africans and Afro-Americans adjusted to the conditions in which they found them› selves.

As Frazier saw it, Herskovits' theory could lead to the conclusion that the persistence of African cultural values might be regarded as evidence supporting the racialist argument that blacks cannot be assimilated.

It is therefore not to be wondered at that the projects of emigration to Africa—the return of the African race to the land of their forefathers, from which these were so ruthlessly torn—should be continually gaining new adherents, and be used by the Negroes as a means for improving their *status* and position in the States. We have just now received the account, published in the *New York Times*, of a great emigration meeting of colonial people, held at Montgomery, Alabama, on the 25th September last. In it we read that ""a large procession of coloured men, headed by music, and several hundred men on horseback, carrying portraits of Garfield and Arthur and flags and banners with appropriate inscriptions, marched through the principal streets of the city, making a magnificent display. When they reached the fair grounds, the place of meeting, there were nearly 4,000 coloured men present, all of whom were voters."" The meeting was opened by religious services. The great aim of the speakers was, however, to persuade the people to remain in America. ""Each speaker,"" we read, ""advised the people that it would be to their interest to stay in the country where most of them were born and raised, and where the climate best suited them, provided the Democratic Party would respect their rights as freemen, and not deprive them of the most sacred rights of the American citizen—the right of a free ballot. The resolutions, passed unanimously, contained mainly the same sentiments, and declared most emphatically that the coloured Republicans would give the Democrats one more chance at the Presidential and Congressional election, in November next, and if they were again counted out at that time, then, the resolution says, ""we are unwilling to longer remain in the country where our most sacred rights are so shamelessly disregarded, and we solemnly pledge ourselves to sever our relations with our present fellow-citizens, and go to a country where our rights as citizens and men will be respected."" Another resolution was resolved—""Also, that we have come to the conclusion herein expressed in sorrow and not in anger; that we earnestly hope our appeal will be heeded, and that the sorrow of a separation from life-time friends, old homes, past associations, and the graves of relatives and kindred may thus be avoided. But if it is not heeded, we are determined to execute our purpose at whatever sacrifice of interest, sentiment, and feeling."" One of the resolutions also endorsed every word said by Mr. Paul Strobach, while in New York, concerning the last election farce of Alabama, and especially in his interview with the *New York Times\'* reporter, which was denounced so bitterly by the Democrats here. The following are some of the most conspicuous inscriptions on the banners: ""A Free Ballot and Honest Court, or no Cotton;"" on one side of the banner; on the other, ""Naught is naught, Two is a Figure, All for the White Man, Nothing for the Nigger."" This was signed ""McGhee\'s Switch.""

But even after cupidity had captured the generality there were those who saw that the abnormal relation could not be permanent under the democratic conditions of the law of the land. It was Thomas Jefferson, the writer of the Declaration of Independence, who made the celebrated utterance: ""Nothing is more clearly written in the Book of Destiny than the emancipation of the blacks; and it is equally certain that the two races will never live in a state of equal freedom under the same Government, so insurmountable are the barriers which nature, habit, and opinion have established between them."" For many years the latter part of this dictum was denounced by many good and earnest men. The most intelligent of the coloured people resented it as a prejudiced and anti-Christian conception. But as the years go by and the Negroes rise in education and culture and in proper conception of race gifts, race work and race destiny, the latter clause of that famous sentence is shorn of its obscurity and repulsiveness, and is welcomed as embodying a truth indispensable to the preservation and prosperity of both races, and as pointing to the regeneration of the African Fatherland.\n\nIt was under the conviction of the truth expressed by that statesman that certain gentlemen of all political shades and differing religious views, in 1816-17, organised the American Colonisation Society. Their labours furnished encouragement for persons desiring to free their slaves, giving them the assurance that their freed men would be returned to their Fatherland, carrying thither what Christianity and civilisation they had received.\n\nThe first phase of the Negro problem was solved at Appomattox, after the battle of the warrior, with confused noise and garments rolled in blood. The institution of slavery, for which so many sacrifices had been made, so many of the principles of humanity had been violated, was at last destroyed by violence.\n\nNow the nation confronts the second phase, the educational, and millions are being poured out by State governments and by individual philanthropy for the education of the freedmen, preparing them for the third and last phase of the problem, viz: Emigration.\n\nIt is not surprising that some of those who, after having been engaged in solving the first phase of the problem and are now confronting the second, should be unable to receive with patience the suggestion of the third, which is the emigration phase, when the Negro, shall bid farewell to these scenes of his bondage and betake himself to the land of his fathers, the scene of larger opportunities and loftier achievements.'}]","[{'document_title': 'The Contemplated Immigration of American Africans into Liberia', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The latter have, since their emancipation, greatly falsified the prediction of their enemies, that when the terrors of the ""lash"" should be withdrawn they would cease to labour. The continually increasing production of cotton in those States, throws back the calumny into the faces of the false prophets who uttered it. That the African race has therefore risen in the estimation of the white American people does not, however, so remove the causes of separation between the races as to render the position of the Africans free from all that is calculated to produce bitterness of feeling among them. The difference of colour is a broad line of distinction that can never be obliterated. There may be a proclaimed equality before the law, but the deep-rooted prejudices of the great majority, the thirty-five millions of whites, against the comparatively feeble minority of five millions of coloured people, will, and must for ages if not for ever, make themselves felt to the discomfort and humiliation of the latter. We always therefore felt that the spirit of emigration to Africa would revive, and that the great advantages offered to them by Liberia as a ""Home,"" would not always be disregarded. It has been alone owing to the poverty of the Liberian Government that the indifference to the advantages it has to offer has been owing. If the Liberian Government had possessed the means that would enable it to assist emigration from America, instead of the assistance being tendered by Christian philanthropy in America, the civilized population of Liberia would ere this have been doubled in number. If there be a real and lasting vitality, however, in the present movement of which we are writing, we should rejoice rather than grieve as regards the recent stagnation in emigration. The coloured people who are now turning their attention to Liberia, if we understand aright, are not paupers and destitute, dependent entirely on philanthropic aid for a passage to and settlement in Liberia, but men and women, who have saved of the fruits of their industry, and who are moved by social considerations to seek a country where there will not be any white prejudices arrayed against them, and where they themselves will become part of the governing powers. There is so vast a difference in the two positions of the coloured people in America and in Africa (in Liberia), that as education progresses and the means for comfortable emigration increase among them, the attractions of Liberia must draw thousands and tens of thousands of them to its shores. If by means of the movement now happily begun, the civilized, educated population of Liberia could within a few years be raised to only one hundred thousand souls, Liberia would indeed become a Queen in Africa. The resources offered by coffee cultivation alone ought to attract the number we have mentioned. The distance from Liberia to the United States is a very short one and a very easy one. Should the exodus assume any large proportions, steam would be economically employed, and the ocean would be comparatively bridged over. We observe with pleasure that our ardent, indefatigable friend, Mr. Hazeley, is placing the question of emigration to Liberia before the coloured people in the Southern States of America in all its bearings and in its true light; and deeply interested as we are in all that concerns true progress in Liberia, we rejoice that he is in America at this important period, and engaged in giving a right direction to the aspirations of the coloured people, for that independence and equality which they can never fully obtain where they now are.

It seems to me an extraordinary thing that in all that is said about the impossible situation on the other side of the water, it is constantly lost sight of that these black people were transported thither forcibly and utterly against their will, and that it was only to be expected that an impossible state of things would sooner or later be created. There are two expressions in Mr. Edmondston\'s letter which appear to me utterly to misstate the case. He abhors the idea of \'Anglo-Saxon blood submitting tamely to the oppression of a horde of savage negroes.\' He also says \'there happens to exist within their borders an alien and inferior race.\' Surely, Sir, this is not a correct statement of the case. These American folk did not hesitate to use the labour of the black people without payment until the last war put an end to the bondage, but there are certain points that they must not refuse to consider if they desire to escape the difficulties created by this emancipation. Undoubtedly freedom was given in a sudden moment of enthusiasm and in response to a violent and forcible demand, and it is obvious that full enfranchisement was prematurely afforded. But such methods will not right matters. Two wrongs do not make a right. The determination to keep black people in a state of ignorance, so as to exclude them from the right to vote, is unworthy and impossible. Lynching is not going to meet the situation either. Both are utterly unworthy methods of bullying a weak and maltreated race. The true solution is repatriation. Why talk of planting British Indians in Africa when so many expatriated Africans will colonise it far more satisfactorily? I admit that Liberia has not been a success so far. But I contend that limited repatriation wisely directed can be made a success. Some of the \'back wages\' of these black people in America might well be used for this purpose.

The reports from that country are favourable, and the condition of many of the freedmen is such as to make them discontented and anxious to go somewhere or anywhere. It is not certain that their condition would be very much improved by emigration, though they would be relieved of some of the restraints to which they are now subjected. Their removal would not be of advantage to this country. They are needed where they are to raise cotton and rice, sugar, tobacco, and corn. Negro labour is required for the development of the southern country, and in time coloured people in that section will have their civil and political rights fully recognized. This recognition may come peaceably, by the assent of their neighbours, and a denial of their rights will at the most only postpone it. A large exodus of negroes would be a great calamity to the landowners and business men of the South, as it would cause an advance in the price of labour. While, therefore, the emigrants would gain but little, and the country and more especially the southern portions, would sustain a loss by such an emigration, the coloured people who should remain would be the gainers by it, as their labour would be in greater demand, and they would receive better treatment from employers. It is not probable that the Government will afford any encouragement to an outward movement of a needed class of citizens, even though they ask it, and few of the coloured people can go to Liberia without aid. Those who are able to go are most of them so well off as to be contented where they are, and under the present system of employing negro labour at the South, there is not likely to be a rapid increase of the independent class at present.

Washington's Up From Slavery (1899), because of which he later said he was 'doomed' to become a race leader,$^{6}$ and his encounter with the Egyptian intellectual Duse Muhammed Ali, a staunch critic of Britain and American African policies in his book In the Land of the Pharaohs (1911). Duse himself had earlier travelled and worked briefly as a stage actor and political activist in the United States before settling in London.\nAfter returning to Jamaica, in 1914 Garvey founded his project designed to advance African emigration and related programmes and called it the Universal Negro Improvement and Conservation Association and African Communities League (later simply the UNIA). At the age of 28, Garvey went to the United States attracted by Washington's work, fired by Duse's example, and armed with a programme of race redemption: the establish› ment of industrial and agricultural schools for blacks in Jamaica, a Black Star fleet of ships for commerce between blacks in Africa and the Americas, and, most of all, a 'central nation for the race'.

Few responded, although a group did organize the African Development Society in 1899, the chief objective of which was to encourage Afro-Americans to buy land and settle in East Central Africa. The Society would sell shares or land rights offered by African petitioners but only to Afro-American or African purchasers. 4 Bishop Turner also later served as an adviser to the International Migration Society (IMS) of Alabama, which sent about 500 emigrants to Africa before it became defunct in 1900. Some of the 500 remained in Liberia; others returned to the United States. Those who remained fared reasonably well; evidently more than a few of them prospered. On the other hand, those who returned told horror stories of poor land, inadequate food and poor living conditions. These stories reduced the likelihood of any large-scale Afro-American emigration movement, even though prospects for blacks in the United States were declining from 1895 to 1900. Nevertheless, numerous Afro-Americans evidently continued to give serious consider› ation to African emigration, just as others in the United States and the Caribbean simply moved away from overt discriminatory practices into other regions near by.\nAfter the turn of the twentieth century, the back-to-Africa baton was picked up by others. For example, one Captain Dean, early in the twentieth century, hoped to engineer the settlement of American blacks in South Africa to fashion a powerful black state there. After the briefest sojourn meant to arrange for this settlement, however, white authorities expelled Dean from the Cape for what were termed 'provocative activities'. And in 1914, Chief Alfred C. Sam, a Gold Coast African, turned up in Oklahoma, persuaded about sixty black farmers that Africa offered them greater oppor› tunities and sailed with them to Saltpond in the Gold Coast. Finding Chief Sam's claims to be exaggerated and encountering restrictions from the Gold Coast officials which inhibited the entry of American immigrants, most of the Oklahomans eventually returned to the United States.

Also, by 1892 black applications to the ACS for passage to Liberia had increased rapidly and several hundred black farmers from Arkansas and Oklahoma arrived in New York hoping to be transported to Africa. Moreover, in 1893, when he visited Liberia, Bishop Turner glowingly reported that 'one thing the Black man has here [in Liberia]... is Manhood, freedom; and the fullest liberty; he feels like a Lord and walks the same way'.$^{1}$ And again in 1896 he asserted: 'I believe two or three million of us should return to the land of our ancestors and establish our own nations, civilizations, laws, customs, style of manufacture ... and cease to be grumblers, chronic complainers and a menace to the white man's country he claims and is bound to dominate'.$^{2}$ Through Bishop Turner's efforts, over 300 Afro-Americans emigrated to Liberia in March 1896.

Cre› ativity became especially necessary where a small number of Europeans lived among a large number of Africans as was the case in many colonies of exploitation such as Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Saint-Domingue.

In the USA, the idea of the repatriation of Africans had been mentioned occasionally throughout the eighteenth century, most notably in 1777, when Thomas Jefferson sponsored a report in a committee of the Virginia legislature. Repatriation began in earnest after 1815, however, when a small group of thirty-eight black Americans led by Paul Cuffe returned to Africa. By 1830, Liberia had become the focus for a general colony of repatriated Africans, mostly ex-slaves, sponsored by the American Colonization Society with the financial support of the Federal as well as many State governments. By i860, only about 15000 settlers had returned to Africa. After the Civil War, less than 2000 settlers made the trip, despite the rapid deterioration of the conditions of life for Afro-Americans in the USA.\nTwo other sources provided returning immigrants. The first came from the unknown number of maroons and Africans taken from confiscated slave ships during the nineteenth century, and shipped back to Africa by the British in their zealous attempt to terminate the trade in slaves and replace it by 'legitimate' trade. The second source of African returnees came from an even smaller number of missionaries recruited in the Caribbean and southern states of the USA, principally by the Moravians and Presby› terians, to assist in the propagation of the Christian Gospel in West Africa. The most well-known example of this is perhaps the Basel Mission enterprise among the Akwapim hills of Ghana in the 1830s and 1840s, and their decision in 1843 to use Jamaicans as substitutes for German and Swiss missionaries whose mortality in the field proved too high for evan› gelical efficacy."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Conclusions', 'content': 'In broad pan-Africanist terms, however, the evidence seems clear that African political and ideological visions were expanded and technical expertise was improved because of colonial African interactions with American blacks. The much-heralded black emigration schemes trumpeted by Garvey, whose ubiquitous publications reached deep into Africa, were only one example of a leitmotif which brought American blacks within the world view of African peoples. The themes of African redemption through American black missionaries were another.\nAfricans themselves, however, created the context of their next interaction with American blacks as they matriculated at American, largely Afro-American, schools and attended pan-African conferences and the like. Consequently, many Africans underwent a technical-educationalpolitical experience alien to their colonial world. When they re-entered their own worlds, many felt driven to resolve questions of ideology, cultural definition, educational values, political power, and pan-African unity or consciousness, guided by new perspectives.\nViewed against such an historical backdrop, the numerous pan-African conferences, Tuskegean educational and technical projects, the nØgritude movement and the occasional focus on American blacks in African millen› nial dreams, all illustrate the consistency of the pan-African theme among American and Caribbean blacks. They also show the variability of African responses to the New World overtures and ultimately the shaping by Africans themselves of these overtures to fit African specifications.\nIn sum, the populations of the African diaspora and the motive charac› terizing the many interactions between persons of the first and second black worlds included two visions. One was a vision of the union of religious forces among black populations in Africa and America or the reconstruction of Africa through importation of American and Antillean black technical expertise, initiated at the behest of American blacks. Another reflected the transformation of Africans from predicate to subject during the colonial period. The latter was a vision of the spiritual redemption, social recon› struction, and political reformation of African communities through the repatriation of African personnel and the energizing of African resources. Because of this vision, Africans had been educated in American schools, or sent to participate in technical and commercial activities; others were touched by American black writings or by anti-colonial ventures organized among blacks of the diaspora.

Repatri› ation during the nineteenth century offered few material rewards for Europeans or non-Europeans. But by 1900, the divergence between Africa and the Americas had become too great. Persons of African descent became caught up in the self-consciousness of the age which produced the type of xenophobic nationalism that all but destroyed the appeal of Africa. More› over, the interest in Africa after the end of the slave trade grew from national lusts for power and wealth - and Afro-Americans lacked both political power and the wealth needed to stimulate their own interest, or influence those who were partitioning Africa into colonial spheres. The Afro-American view became focused more on the new developments within their hemisphere. Internal and inter-regional migrations and the quest to establish the good life against new deleterious challenges absorbed their attention. The African connection faded, but did not die.

This is true of Haiti, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Barbados, for example. The second group comprises countries where the proportion of the population of African origin is insignificant in demographic terms.

The second group consists of those countries which have groups of African origin which have not undergone an integration process in the New World, such as Surinam where the Bonis, the Djukas, the Saramacas and the Akwas are found, and Jamaica, Santo Domingo and even Haiti and Cuba, the home of the maroons. Living in the forest, groups in Suriname and in French Guiana have retained more or less intact their fundamental cultural values and a certain social organization. The maroons were communities of run› away slaves who took refuge in the mountains of those countries, thus cutting themselves off from contact with the colonizers. At least a good portion of these communities succeeded in maintaining themselves isolated from the former colonizers. Later on, in Suriname, French Guiana and, to a certain extent, in Jamaica, they held themselves aloof from what could be called the 'national community'.\nFrom the demographic standpoint, the composition of the population of each country should be carefully checked with reference to three main groups: the population of African origin, that of European origin and, lastly, that of local origin - the 'Amerindians'.

Ford himself answered such a call by a delegation of Fälasa (black Ethiopian Jews) and left for Ethiopia in 1930 where he evidently remained until his death during the time of the Italian-Ethiopian War (1935-6).$^{I2}$ The majority of the American emigrants Ford encountered in Ethiopia when he arrived there were Jamaicans, and, occasionally, other Afro-Caribbean folk. A recent account suggests that 'the West Indians appear to have been more prepared than some of the Americans to make what adjustments were necessary to living in Ethiopia' although both groups suffered discrimination from time to time. 1 3 Of course, even before Garvey's time, other American blacks had emigrated to Ethiopia, but as individual settlers. For example, in the 1890s Benito Sylvain, a Haitian, brought to the Court of Menelik II a plan for a 'Pan-Negro' organization. Clearly, however, the largest waves of American black immigrants came in the late 1920s and early 1930s, that is, after Garvey's break with the Liberians and through the time of the Emperor's accession, with the greatest numbers of these responding to meetings with Ethiopian travellers. In the period immediately following the restoration of Haile Sellassie in 1941, a new trickle of Afro-Americans (possibly twenty) came to Ethiopia. The period, however, falls beyond the scope of this chapter. Suffice it to say that the numbers of black immigrants from the Americas to Ethiopia peaked during activities associated with Garvey, Ford and the Emperor and were not equalled before or after that era. 14"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'The persistence and transformation of African cultural values in Latin America and the Caribbean', 'content': 'The problem of colour distinctions arises in different ways, for, according to Roger Bastide, \'whether the colour line is institutionalized, as in the United States, or not, the result is the same.

On the other hand, in Jamaica, with the Sasabonsan cult, of Asante origin, elements of \'African culture\' persisted during that historical period, subsequently vanishing to give way to spirit-based cults involving a large dose of magic, as was the case in 1894 of the \'Jamaica Baptist Free Church\', a sect founded by Bed ward.\nIn those parts of the Americas exposed to the teachings of Catholicism, a form of syncretism based on the co-existence of European and African cultural features arose.

Exactly how much is anybody's guess. The effect of colonial African experience with American blacks appears, nevertheless, unique and vital in terms of subsequent social and political activities. For some, the American black component within African nationalist ideology and strategies emerging during the colonial period was striking and unequivocal. In the view of others, for example some African students, interactions within American black arenas were disappointing and unrewarding. The caustic assessment of one such visitor illustrates the latter point: 'One of the things I had decided to find out during my stay in America was the condition of the descendants of former slaves brought here from Africa ... I feel safe in saying that, so far as economic and material progress are concerned the Negro in America is on the average ahead of the West African, but when it comes to integrity and genuine manhood, the American Negro is far below him.' 75 Another view was that many Afro-American missionaries who viewed Africans as 'poor heathen savages' must bear some of the responsibility for perpetuating a distorted and pernicious picture of Africa and Africans in the minds of their fellow American blacks. In other words, in their sedulous campaign to recruit American black workers for foreign missions, missionary churches undoubtedly succumbed occasionally to the tempta- tion of portraying an exotic, erotic and socially inferior Africa much in need of great sacrifice, hard work, and alien redemption."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.625, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Black American evangelism in Africa', 'content': ""At the Congress, Bishop Turner renewed his advocacy of black emi› gration to Liberia.

Occupation and biological heritage could and did increase class and caste mobility both during and after slavery. An individual or a family could work their way outward and often upward from slavery to freedom, or from free black to mulatto (especially in Brazil and Spanish America), or from mulatto to white (an exceptional achievement requiring a considerable amount of money) when the indices of race were more strongly cultural than biological. By the later eighteenth century some Spanish American planters and merchants, doubtful of their status, bought certificates from the Crown, called limpieza de sangre, which certified that they had no Moorish or Jewish ancestors in at least the preceding four generations. Ultimately, however, internal social mobility and the general quality of life depended on the immediate circumstances of the community: on factors of demography, economy, law, social and political philosophy, and degree of cultural pluralism.

He replied in the negative. I gathered from what he said that the whole matter had been under consideration with the Ministers for some time back, and that the Duke of Newcastle had had much correspondence with the authorities in the West India colonies about it. *The conclusion had been that, on the whole, it might be the means of entangling them in some way or other with the difficulties in the United States, by possible reclamations of fugitives or in some other way—a danger which they were most desirous to avoid.* Hence they should not be inclined to enter upon negotiations, and least of all to adopt the form of a convention. I explained the reasons why we had wished to take this course, *our object simply being to secure for those persons voluntarily disposed to emigrate (and we did not mean to include any others) the enjoyment of the rights to which they could be justly entitled as colonists. His lordship seemed to understand it.* But he remarked that some time ago an agent had been sent from the West Indies to the United States to see if sufficient inducements could be held out to the free negroes to emigrate, but he had found them so comfortable, and earning so much higher a rate of wages than could be obtained at the place he came from, that any transfer of them seemed out of the question. I then referred to an application that had been made to me by a private individual here, named Davis, styling himself the representative of much landed property in the island of Jamaica, to obtain as many as 5,000 families, to whom he would be ready to assign lands if the expense of transportation could be paid for. I had answered the gentleman by referring him to my own Government, and that only after he should have made his own aware of his object and ready to approve it. His lordship said he supposed that the grant of land would be only in consideration of labour. He thought it very likely that many of these people might ultimately find their way over from the United States, but he did not consider it expedient just now to make any provision about it. He expressed a little surprise that Hayti had not been preferred. I observed that efforts had been made in that direction, and some emigrants had actually gone, but the negroes were sluggish to move, and they were deterred by the difference of language and habits. I had always thought that fewer obstacles would be found to removal to the English islands than to any other, after it should once be set agoing. His lordship admitted it as very possible, at least to those of them where there was a sensible deficiency of labour; but the rate of wages, though rising, was still quite low. Under these circumstances, I remarked that it seemed of no use for me to press the point further.

B. F. Porter, President of the Liberian Exodus Association, had just then returned to Charleston from New York, where he had purchased, on account of the Association, a ship named the Azor, which will take over the first emigrants, 250 in number. She was expected to sail about the 25th March for Monrovia. These emigrants are almost exclusively persons already waiting in Charleston to embark. It is further stated that there were about 350 then waiting, two-thirds of whom are able to comply with the main condition of transportation—ability and means to take care of themselves—for the first six months after their arrival. Those who as yet are not in a condition to do this are expected to remain here at work until they accumulate means to do so. The vessel has already a large cargo of provisions, iron, &c., including forty barrels of flour, the same of meal, pork, and beef, some codfish and mackerel, a quantity of salt, potatoes, agricultural implements, a few cases of dry goods and boots and shoes, and a large medicine chest. These things are all the private property of those who propose going on the first trip. A physician, Dr. F. A. Watts, of Washington, will accompany the party. The run to Monrovia is expected to occupy about thirty days.\n\nMr. Porter says, further, that, besides the money already paid for the ship, enough was left to make a good start on the payment of the first instalment on the steamship which they propose purchasing. A large number of persons at New Orleans will, he says, be shortly ready to remit the payments on their shares of stock. This will complete the amount necessary for the payment of the first instalment. The Azor's captain thinks that with fair winds he can make the run to Monrovia in thirty days. He will immediately return for another cargo of emigrants, bringing a small cargo of African products which has already been secured. This will be consigned either to Charleston or Boston. The general plan will be the taking out of people as fast as possible, bringing back on the return trip cargoes of African goods. Mr. Porter asseverates strongly that there are 25,000 coloured people through the Southern States who have a direct financial interest in the scheme, and over 160,000 who are enrolled to go when the opportunity arises.""}, {'id': 6027, 'article_title': 'Repatriation of West African Natives', 'full_section_title': 'Repatriation of West African Natives', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/07_11_1890#article-3', 'issue_date': '07_11_1890', 'content': 'The energetic Governor of Lagos is interesting himself in a movement the results of which may be of doubtful benefit to West Africa. In August last he received at Lagos a representative deputation ""of the Brazilian and Havannah repatriates in the colony of Lagos."" It is not stated whether these representatives are pure negroes or mulattoes; but judging from their names—Senhor Ferreia, Senhor Agost Mendez, Senhor P. F. Da Costa—they seem to be a stage above the ordinary Brazilian negro. Moreover, the conclusion one naturally comes to from the tenour of the report of the meeting is that these representatives are Brazilian born and not emigrants from West Africa; therefore, it seems remarkable that they should be able to speak the language of the people of Yoruba, the country which lies inland from Lagos, and that the traditions and language of West Africa should be still kept up among the negroes on the other side of the Atlantic. In reply to the inquiry of the Governor these representatives assured him that all the negroes of Brazil wished to return to their country, although they admitted that the older men were much more anxious to return than the Creoles. At the same time they stated that the majority were anxious to ""repatriate"" themselves. The Governor immediately concluded that half the negro population of Brazil (1,000,000) were eager to leave the land where many of them had been slaves, and return to a country where, no doubt, they believe they will be absolutely independent. Poverty, the representatives stated, was the only thing that prevented them from carrying out their wishes. The Governor then informed the deputation that he had succeeded in inducing the commercial world to take an interest in this movement. The African Steamship Company have agreed to run their vessel, the Biafra, between Lagos and Brazil, purely, however, as a commercial speculation. The fares for negroes passing to and from Brazil will be as low as possible, while the deck accommodation will be comfortable. But the migration is not to be all on one side. The Governor of Lagos is convinced that negro labour is absolutely necessary to the development of the resources of Brazil, and now that a republic has been established, such labour will be more and more in demand. Moreover, there is already a fair trade between West Africa and Brazil, which is no doubt capable of considerable extension. Sir Alfred Moloney\'s idea, therefore, is not only to encourage the ""repatriation"" of Brazilian negroes but to establish a system of contract labour, by means of which the West African native may go to Brazil for a series of years, and return home with his savings, with habits of industry, and possibly with the knowledge of some handicraft. The Governor is persuaded that this would be good for his colony. At present these West African colonies are dependent upon one commodity, oil, and they have suffered much from recent depreciation in its price. Governor Moloney has done much to induce the natives to attend to other products, natural and introduced. If, therefore, the repatriation of Brazilian negroes will stimulate the stay-at-home native to the industrial development of their country, much good will be done. But that is the question. From the history of Liberia it seems doubtful whether the native will be able to do more than scrape together a bare living. Moreover, it seems very likely that 1,000,000 Brazilian negroes and half-castes are awaiting ""repatriation"" in a country where they would not be half as well off as they are at present. Still, Sir Alfred Moloney\'s experiment is worth making, and everyone will wish that the result may be for the good of the ""repatriates,"" the natives, and the colony generally. It may be remembered that a somewhat similar movement is on foot in the United States; and no doubt if half the present negro population of North America could be deported to Liberia, the Congo, and elsewhere in Africa, it would be a great relief to their present country.—*Times.*'}]","[{'document_title': 'GOOD TIDINGS FOR LIBERIA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There is a movement among the Africans in the United States toward Liberia sufficiently marked to have induced the New York Correspondent of the London daily paper, the _Standard_, to give his version of it.

He says there is a _strong feeling_ in favour of moving over to Liberia; that ""in Charleston alone 2,500 negroes are already enrolled to go to Liberia, and in the State of South Carolina, up to the present time, _thirty thousand_ are enrolled. A grand mass meeting was held in Charleston on the 4th July, at which are reported to have been present between ten and fifteen thousand negroes."" ""In the churches—generally Methodist and Baptist—which are organized separate from the whites, these movements are generally fostered.

This fact having been proclaimed in the Southern States, many negroes have already gone to Liberia; and the reports they have sent back are of so encouraging a character that many others are preparing to follow. A party of four of these negro emigrants passed through Liverpool recently. They were en route for Liberia, having arrived from New York by the Cunard steamer Aurania. They were from the southern portion of Illinois, and they were going to Grand Bassam, Liberia. When questioned as to their object, one of the party, who acted as spokesman, said: ""Three of us are free slaves, including this lady.

It is governed the same as the United States. There is a President and Congress. We also want to get among our own people, for, although we are free in the United States, we have great obstacles to contend with by the white people offering trade opposition to us and trying to put other impediments in our way. We have heard excellent accounts from those of our people who have gone to Liberia. Clubs of coloured people have been formed in the different Southern States to assist, with information, our people to leave places where they are harshly treated, and settle in Liberia. The secretary of the club where we come from is a coloured gentleman, named Hutchinson, a man of intelligence and substance, who resides in Metropolis, in the State of Illinois.

The continually increasing production of cotton in those States, throws back the calumny into the faces of the false prophets who uttered it. That the African race has therefore risen in the estimation of the white American people does not, however, so remove the causes of separation between the races as to render the position of the Africans free from all that is calculated to produce bitterness of feeling among them. The difference of colour is a broad line of distinction that can never be obliterated. There may be a proclaimed equality before the law, but the deep-rooted prejudices of the great majority, the thirty-five millions of whites, against the comparatively feeble minority of five millions of coloured people, will, and must for ages if not for ever, make themselves felt to the discomfort and humiliation of the latter. We always therefore felt that the spirit of emigration to Africa would revive, and that the great advantages offered to them by Liberia as a ""Home,"" would not always be disregarded. It has been alone owing to the poverty of the Liberian Government that the indifference to the advantages it has to offer has been owing. If the Liberian Government had possessed the means that would enable it to assist emigration from America, instead of the assistance being tendered by Christian philanthropy in America, the civilized population of Liberia would ere this have been doubled in number. If there be a real and lasting vitality, however, in the present movement of which we are writing, we should rejoice rather than grieve as regards the recent stagnation in emigration. The coloured people who are now turning their attention to Liberia, if we understand aright, are not paupers and destitute, dependent entirely on philanthropic aid for a passage to and settlement in Liberia, but men and women, who have saved of the fruits of their industry, and who are moved by social considerations to seek a country where there will not be any white prejudices arrayed against them, and where they themselves will become part of the governing powers. There is so vast a difference in the two positions of the coloured people in America and in Africa (in Liberia), that as education progresses and the means for comfortable emigration increase among them, the attractions of Liberia must draw thousands and tens of thousands of them to its shores. If by means of the movement now happily begun, the civilized, educated population of Liberia could within a few years be raised to only one hundred thousand souls, Liberia would indeed become a Queen in Africa. The resources offered by coffee cultivation alone ought to attract the number we have mentioned. The distance from Liberia to the United States is a very short one and a very easy one. Should the exodus assume any large proportions, steam would be economically employed, and the ocean would be comparatively bridged over.

It is not probable that the Government will afford any encouragement to an outward movement of a needed class of citizens, even though they ask it, and few of the coloured people can go to Liberia without aid. Those who are able to go are most of them so well off as to be contented where they are, and under the present system of employing negro labour at the South, there is not likely to be a rapid increase of the independent class at present. They may long for a land of promise, but the hardest of taskmasters, necessity, will hold them where they are.""\n\nA paper published further South says, ""editorially"": ""Before we take the attitude of advisers to those who seem determined to leave the country, we must reassure them as to our friendship and our good intentions.

Its adjustment to changing times was noticeable from the mid-century when, under the influence of a French trading firm, Victor RØgis, King Gezo (c. 1818-58) of Dahomey was persuaded to intensify the trade in palm oil, first as a supplement to the export of slaves and eventually as the dominant factor in the state's export economy.$^{41}$ The transition from slave to 'legi› timate' trade meant a corresponding increase in the need to retain war captives as labour for the maintenance and expansion of the palm oil industry.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

The eventual substitution of French for Portuguese control of the area of the Gulf of Benin west of the Werne still left a residue of Latin culture sufficient to make Brazilians prefer this to the eastern coast, where Latin cultural influence was destined for eventual extinction. Consequently, it was in the area that eventually became French Dahomey that is the western parts of the region under discussion - that Brazilian Africans made their greatest impact. Not only did they co-operate with the French in the latter's successful bid to conquer Dahomey and create their new colony: Brazilians also ranked first and foremost in the colony in taking full advantage of French colonial education, thus making them a crucial factor in the growth of Dahomey as the 'Quartier Latin of French West Africa'. 45 However, this dichotomy in the locational focus of the impact of Saros and Brazilians must not be interpreted as contradictory to the overall development of the Mono-Niger region as an integral whole.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century.

The much-heralded black emigration schemes trumpeted by Garvey, whose ubiquitous publications reached deep into Africa, were only one example of a leitmotif which brought American blacks within the world view of African peoples. The themes of African redemption through American black missionaries were another.\nAfricans themselves, however, created the context of their next interaction with American blacks as they matriculated at American, largely Afro-American, schools and attended pan-African conferences and the like. Consequently, many Africans underwent a technical-educationalpolitical experience alien to their colonial world. When they re-entered their own worlds, many felt driven to resolve questions of ideology, cultural definition, educational values, political power, and pan-African unity or consciousness, guided by new perspectives.\nViewed against such an historical backdrop, the numerous pan-African conferences, Tuskegean educational and technical projects, the nØgritude movement and the occasional focus on American blacks in African millen› nial dreams, all illustrate the consistency of the pan-African theme among American and Caribbean blacks. They also show the variability of African responses to the New World overtures and ultimately the shaping by Africans themselves of these overtures to fit African specifications.\nIn sum, the populations of the African diaspora and the motive charac› terizing the many interactions between persons of the first and second black worlds included two visions. One was a vision of the union of religious forces among black populations in Africa and America or the reconstruction of Africa through importation of American and Antillean black technical expertise, initiated at the behest of American blacks. Another reflected the transformation of Africans from predicate to subject during the colonial period. The latter was a vision of the spiritual redemption, social recon› struction, and political reformation of African communities through the repatriation of African personnel and the energizing of African resources. Because of this vision, Africans had been educated in American schools, or sent to participate in technical and commercial activities; others were touched by American black writings or by anti-colonial ventures organized among blacks of the diaspora.

The Society would sell shares or land rights offered by African petitioners but only to Afro-American or African purchasers. 4 Bishop Turner also later served as an adviser to the International Migration Society (IMS) of Alabama, which sent about 500 emigrants to Africa before it became defunct in 1900. Some of the 500 remained in Liberia; others returned to the United States. Those who remained fared reasonably well; evidently more than a few of them prospered. On the other hand, those who returned told horror stories of poor land, inadequate food and poor living conditions. These stories reduced the likelihood of any large-scale Afro-American emigration movement, even though prospects for blacks in the United States were declining from 1895 to 1900. Nevertheless, numerous Afro-Americans evidently continued to give serious consider› ation to African emigration, just as others in the United States and the Caribbean simply moved away from overt discriminatory practices into other regions near by.\nAfter the turn of the twentieth century, the back-to-Africa baton was picked up by others. For example, one Captain Dean, early in the twentieth century, hoped to engineer the settlement of American blacks in South Africa to fashion a powerful black state there. After the briefest sojourn meant to arrange for this settlement, however, white authorities expelled Dean from the Cape for what were termed 'provocative activities'. And in 1914, Chief Alfred C. Sam, a Gold Coast African, turned up in Oklahoma, persuaded about sixty black farmers that Africa offered them greater oppor› tunities and sailed with them to Saltpond in the Gold Coast. Finding Chief Sam's claims to be exaggerated and encountering restrictions from the Gold Coast officials which inhibited the entry of American immigrants, most of the Oklahomans eventually returned to the United States.

This led not only to an increase in the size of existing eastern Aja settlements such as Badagry, Ajido and Koga; it also brought about the creation of numerous new settlements in the western and south-western parts of the area of the present-day Lagos State and Ogun State of Nigeria. 35 A similar colonization movement was in evidence further east. In Yorubaland, for example, there was a remarkable interpØnØtration and mixing of the several sub-ethnic groups. Here the most spectacular effect was produced by the Oyo, whose diaspora began in the first two decades of the century when the forces of instability were unleashed on the capital of the old empire. By 1830, the main centres in which Oyo migrants settled had included Ibadan, Ijaye and present-day Oyo town, north of Ibadan. However, it was Ibadan imperialist expansion between the 1840s and 1860s that led to the full flowering of the Oyo diaspora. As a result, several Oyo communities moving in from the north-west were established among the Igbomina, Ijesa, Ekiti, Akoko, Ondo, Ikale and Ilaje sub-culture areas of eastern and south-eastern Yorubaland.$^{36}$ Conversely, eastern Yoruba groups such as the Ekiti and Ijeça came as captives or freedmen to Ibadan and several other settlements in Osun, Ijebu and the Egba areas in the west and south.

It seemed to us so advisable in the interests of African civilisation that he should be not only allowed, but encouraged and assisted to do so, that we have strenuously advocated the measure. In our May number we made some comments on a letter of the late Commodore on the West Coast station; in which, in pursuance, as we believed of orders from home, the King of Dahomey\'s request was refused. Our correspondence from Dahomey shows us, however, that the King has not accepted this reply of the Commodore as a final decision against him, but has applied directly by letter to Her Majesty\'s Government with the same object. In the article in our May number before alluded to we exposed the error and inconsistency of such a refusal as had been given to the King, and endeavoured once again to show how much that change which we so desire for Dahomey and Ashantee might possibly be forwarded by bringing some of the chief men of those countries into immediate personal contact with our advanced civilisation and all the humane institutions to which the blessed precepts of the Gospel of Peace have given rise among us. There is nothing more necessary to be shown to the authorities of those barbarous countries than the value which we attach to human life; and that although unhappily wars have not ceased among so-called Christian nations, human life is, except upon the battle-field, regarded as a sacred thing, in no case to be wantonly taken away, and in all cases to be hedged round by the supreme authority with all possible protections. We do not know what may be the decision of our Government, and what answer may be sent to the King of Dahomey. We have reason, however, to believe that the arguments put forward by us have not been without effect in modifying opinions in quarters where opposition to the King of Dahomey\'s wishes was known to exist. There is consequently reason to hope that a favourable answer may be accorded, at least to the extent of meeting the King\'s wishes that some of his chiefs should come over to this country, by offering those facilities without which it would be difficult, if not impossible, for them to do so. This, and a formal reception of such envoys by Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, are two very different things. If the latter could by any possibility be construed into an approval of, or even into a cessation of protest against, those horrible barbarities by which Dahomey is polluted, especially in those superstitious ""Customs"" in which human life is so wantonly destroyed, we should say at once that such envoys should not be admitted, either formally or informally, to the Royal presence; but if, as we think there is reason to believe, the personal displeasure of our Sovereign at such atrocities, pronounced by herself in presence of those envoys, might have the effect of inducing the King to put an end at once and for ever to his slave wars and to those appalling ""Customs"" for which Dahomey has become so infamously distinguished, we do venture to express the hope that in the event of the envoys arriving here, some means may be devised by which they may thus become assured of Her Majesty\'s abhorrence of things in which the Kings of Dahomey have delighted, and that Her Majesty considers those things in which they have gloried as incompatible with the existence of any friendly understanding, or interchange of courtesies between herself and him. We do think that some means may be devised by which such a Royal Christian effort might be made in the cause of humanity and of Christian civilisation in Africa without any sacrifice of Royal dignity. The end in view is really a great one. The cessation of slave-hunting wars and of ""Customs"" in Dahomey, and the entry of that country, however feeble at first its steps may be, into the ranks of the world\'s advancing Christian civilisation, would have a great effect on the surrounding countries. A new way would be opened through Dahomey into the interior of Africa. And as the Dahoman Government has long since shown itself alive to the importance of good roads between its principal places, more might possibly be done within a short time in that than in any other native African country in establishing improved communications between the coast and the interior. The visit of the Dahoman envoys to this country, and their judicious reception and entertainment here, are therefore much to be desired. It would be absurd, of course, to bring them over at this time of the year, when they would be exposed to the rigours of winter; but we hope that such an answer may be given to the King\'s application, and such instructions be issued and arrangements made, as may lead to the presence of those men among us some time in the months of May or June of next year.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-09-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_09_1866#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Tribute to the African-Aid Society', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'WE have been often rather tauntingly asked what the African-Aid Society is really effecting.

But should there be no abandonment of his present practices, we demand in addition the occupation of Whydah and Godomey, and the gradual pushing forward of a good road to Abomey. The slave-trade will then cease in the Bight of Benin. What is now spent in watching and repressing it there may thenceforward be devoted to civilization, through productive works. Let civilization set about its work cautiously, but earnestly, and with a determination that Africa is to repay every farthing spent upon her; and we speak advisedly when we say that the result cannot be doubtful. New civilised states will soon be added to the list of those of which the world can already boast. The millions of descendants of slave-exported Africans will gradually return to Africa with the arts and sciences, the industrial knowledge, the germ of Christianity which they have acquired in other lands; and Africa, instead of being the earth's reproach and shame, will become her glory and her praise."", 'last_edit_date': '1863-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1863#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CIVILIZATION OF AFRICA: ENVOYS FROM DAHOMEY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The mouths of many witnesses, and those his own witnesses too.

But, no—""whenever the King of Dahomey renounces the slave-trade, gives up human sacrifices, and commences in real earnest the pursuit of legitimate trade,"" then, and not till then, ""it will be time to consider his proposal"" to be allowed to send some of his subjects—his nobles—to England. When he has made so much progress in civilized ideas that the visit of his people to England will have become comparatively unimportant, then they may come. If there were not great interests of humanity, civilization, and Christianity at stake, we might laugh at the absurdity; but when we look at the results to be obtained by the civilization of Dahomey and of Ashantee, and see such a policy as that under consideration announced from England, our heart almost fails within us. Those two countries are being annually drenched with the blood of victims of an atrocious barbarism, and that blood flows, for the most part, not because of a wanton exercise of a savage despotic power, but at the behests of a most sanguinary superstition. And we prefer to cure these people by offering them the bribe, that if they will first become good, and righteous, and humane, and enlightened in their ideas, some half-a-dozen or more of them shall really be brought over to England to have the honour of a peep at us! If they will swallow our pill first, we will, perhaps, give them (""it will be time to consider his proposal"") a little jam and honey afterwards. And this is the way in which our Government, as a Government, thinks that African civilization may be accomplished. The English people, as individuals, know better. They do not say to the poor wretched victims of a cherished barbarous superstition, cast off your false religion, acknowledge two or three of the great truths of Christianity, and then we will see, perhaps, what can be done for you. No, they send their missionaries to tell them what Christianity is—to show them the difference between what it inculcates, and the bloody system under which they have been for so many ages the benighted victims. And why does not the English Government act on the same principles? Does official position, does official life, remove the members of a Government out of the sphere altogether of the principles and sentiments which would influence and govern them as individual Englishmen? It seems very much like this. We cannot send our civilization to Dahomey and Ashantee for them to look at it and contrast it with their own barbarism, as missionaries can show them the simple truths of Christianity, and ask them to compare them with the foul teachings of their Fetish priests. All the sample of civilization we can send them, after having encouraged their sanguinary systems for ages by our long and active prosecution of the slave-trade on their coasts, is war ships and cannon engaged in protecting legitimate trade, and putting down that slave-trade we so long encouraged and participated in; that according to the ideas of those people, we have only abandoned it because we do not want it any longer, and, like dogs in the manger, refuse to let others eat of what we do not ourselves require. Traders, eager, of course, as traders must be, in the pursuit of gain, ""guns, drums, trumpets, blunderbuss, and thunder,"" war ships, and an occasional missionary, are all the show of civilization we can make to them in their own lands. The mountain cannot go to Mahomet, but Mahomet can be brought to the mountain. We cannot extend civilization and its fruits to the Dahoman and Ashantee anywhere but in England. They begin to know and feel this, and are not at all so unreasonable as we are. They do not say, send England over here that we may look at it, but, take us over to England that we may see what it is. And we want them to see it, or, at least, we ought to want them to see it. What is there, then, that stands in the way? There is no doubt in our own mind on the subject. It would cost a thousand pounds or two, and a little trouble, to gratify their wish. And so this great and noble nation takes refuge under a false and hypocritical exaction. And, of course, it does not expect to be found fault with. What can be better than the things it asks the Dahoman to do? Renounce the slave-trade, give up human sacrifices, buy cottons, guns, powder, and rum, and sell palm-oil and such other articles as your country produces! Who can find fault with this? Not we; only the demand or advice is not likely to be granted or acted upon. The people want an adequate motive for the change demanded. We try to give them one when we endeavour by our ships to make it impossible for them to sell slaves for export. And they understand this motive, because they feel the power of its working. Why not add another motive? Why not show them England and its civilization? Have we no faith in ourselves, or our civilization, or our religion, so that we fear their being too closely looked at by strange eyes? No, it is not this, it is that ignoble motive of a little money, as if civilised Dahomey and Ashantee would not repay it to the country ten thousand times over. Away with it.

Possibly private efforts might, in the lapse of many hundred years, partially effect the civilisation of this vast, rich, and unknown country. Still, if after seventy years' occupancy of Sierra Leone by Great Britain, the inhabitants do not yet know the plough, or any agricultural labour-saving implement whatever, or practise those arts known and esteemed as essential to civil life, you may form some idea of the number of years which individual effort, aided by a British Colonial Government, may require to bring Africa up to the lowest plane and meanest type of civil man.\n\nProfoundly penetrated with these views—knowing from personal and extended observation that they are founded in truth—I cannot too forcibly urge upon you and all true friends of Africa, to concentrate all of influence we may possess in obtaining united national action upon this great subject.\n\nIf it was ever the duty of civil governments to seek to redeem from savage life barbaric nations, surely it is time that England and America should combine in immediately planting in Africa such permanent institutions as will most speedily and effectually work this change.

By establishing agricultural schools—not a chief but would warmly second their efforts—all would gladly send their children; and by the immediate introduction of labour-saving machines, to some of which you lately alluded, the wonderful productiveness of the soil and climate would largely and speedily repay any advance of capital or outlay that may be made, and peace, and law, and kindness, and plenty will effectually take the place of strife, of crime, force, hatred, and want.

The Catholics were very active in the Betsileo country and among the subject peoples, who developed a kind of people's Christianity alongside the official religion. Furthermore, in reaction to authority, there was a revival of traditional religions, despite the public destruction of sampy that accompanied the spread of Christianity.

It was at a time when Britain appeared - and posed as Madagascar's true friend and ally, and British missionaries in Madagascar were not slow to emphasize this time and again. Through men such as James Cameron, the LMS had given a great deal of technical assistance to the Malagasy, and Rainilaiarivony and his colleagues believed that by embracing the LMS's brand of Christianity they would further cement this friendship. In fact, by embracing Protestantism they would draw closer to Britain as allies who could be expected to take their side should difficulties occur again with the French.

It thus became Radama's first task to subdue these rebels, particularly the Bezanozano of Ambotomanga, many of whom fled to the east. Although Radama succeeded in consolidating his position in Imerina, what he desired most was to reach the sea, as his father had directed him to do on his deathbed. Without direct access to the sea, the Merina felt hemmed in by their neighbours, who even raided them for slaves. Merina traders, increasingly anxious to trade at the ports of Tamatave and Majunga directly with Europeans, especially the British in the Mascarene Islands, were forced instead to exchange their handicrafts, rice, beef and other agricultural produce for European salt and ammunition through Bezanozano, Sihanaka and Sakalava intermediaries. Radama saw territorial expansion as part of the heritage of the Maroseranana that he had taken over and, above all, as a filial duty to respect the wishes of his ancestors and fulfil the predictions of soothsayers. 10 It was to the east - towards the increasingly important port of Tamatave that Radama's eyes were first focused. However, the political situation in the surrounding Betsimisaraka area called for intervention. The confederation organized in the eighteenth century by Ratsimilaho had broken up into a multitude of rival principalities at war one with another, and riddled with internal challengers, generally opposed to the authority of the filoha (ruling chiefs), who invited Radama to intervene. In the midst of this political chaos, Jean RenØ, a mØtis, seized control of Tamatave in 1812.$^{11}$ It was largely Radama's desire to establish a route to this eastern port that dictated his diplomatic contacts with Sir Robert Townsend Farquhar, the Governor of Mauritius. His desire to reach the sea coincided with Farquhar's desire - and that of England - to control Madagascar, or at least to influence events there, since Madagascar was the sole source of the cattle and rice imported to Mauritius as well as an important consumer of Mauritius's manufactured goods.

Mala› gasy traditions and the state's constitution forbade the outright grant of land to foreigners, but the government was willing to lease land on which foreigners could establish plantations or capital mineral resources. The first concession was granted in 1855 by Radama (while he was still a prince) to Joseph Lambert, a French adventurer, which was confirmed in the form of a treaty in September 1862.

But those sixteen months had been an unprecedented period for his subjects. Too much had occurred in too short a period, and people had not had enough time to digest the many rapid changes of policies, which were so different from those pursued by his predecessor. The treaties and the charters he had signed had angered the men who had helped him succeed to the throne; and the influence of the missionaries and other foreigners was growing so fast that many of his influential officials were alarmed. There was such discontent at the new policies that during the Ratnanenjana epidemic, those affected claimed that they were possessed by the spirit of the late Queen Rana valona. The climax came when Radama decided to remove from power Rainivoninahitriniony, the Prime Minister; Rainilaiarivony his younger brother; and Rainijohary. All three were leading members of the two clans of Tsimiamboholahy and Tsimahafotsy which, as we have noted, had assisted Andrianampoinimerina to found the Merina kingdom. Radama's plan was to replace this oligarchy by his friends of younger days who called themselves mena maso (literally red eyes), led by nobles from Vakinisinaony, the area of the older capitals of Merina, who claimed seniority and superiority to the Avaradrano of Antananarivo. 44 Above all, Radama appears to have had more confidence in foreigners $^{v}$ than in the Malagasy in running his government. His mission to Europe to seek recognition was led not by Malagasy officials (as in 1836-^7) but by Lambert, the French adventurer. He relied too much on Ellis for advice and, on the death of Rahaniraka in November 1862, Radama appointed William Marks, an American national, and Clement Laborde, the French Consul's son, as Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs. In this, as also in his decision to rely on the mena maso, the two sons of Rainiharo and their supporters, including Rainijohary, realized that the king was set on eradicating them.

Moreover, Madagascar was important for political and strategic considerations. In particular, the British wanted to secure the support of the ruler for the abolition of the slave trade, since Madagascar was one of the main sources of slaves in the region. It was Sir Robert's desire, therefore, to pursue an active political role in Madagascar. This policy, coinciding as it did with Radama's own determination to expand to the east, was to have, as one writer has put it, 'important consequences for the future of Madagascar'. 12 After several friendly contacts, Farquhar sent a diplomatic mission, led by Captain Le Sage, which arrived in Antananarivo on 21 December 1816. A treaty of friendship and commerce was eventually signed on 4 February 1817 between Radama and Le Sage. But this treaty did not satisfy the Mauritian Governor because it did not mention the slave trade, a matter of considerable importance to Sir Robert. The Governor therefore sent another mission to Radama's capital, this time led by James Hastie, a former Sergeant at Arms in India and more experienced in handling negotiations with oriental rulers.$^{13}$ Hastie brought along with him a number of gifts for the king, including horses, a compass, a map of the world and a chiming clock, all of which greatly impressed the young king and helped Hastie to win his love and confidence. The negotiations, however, stumbled over the British insistence that Radama should outlaw the slave trade in Madagascar. When Radama argued that by doing this he would be com› mitting economic suicide because the slave trade was the major source of his revenue, Hastie had a ready answer: the British would pay the Malagasy ruler an annual sum of 1000 dollars in gold, 1000 dollars in silver, a hundred barrels of gunpowder, 100 English muskets with 100 flints, 400 soldiers' uniforms, 12 sergeants' swords, 600 pieces of cloth, a full-dress uniform for himself and 2 horses as compensation.$^{14}$ Radama considered that he had made a fair deal, especially since the treaty also recognized him as king of the whole of Madagascar.

They sent some young Malagasy either to England or Mauritius for technical education; and at home introduced many technical skills and ideas such as carpentry, building, tannery, the art of modern tin-plating and weaving. The most outstanding missionary who assisted the Malagasy in technical education was James Cameron; he arrived in Antananarivo in 1826 and, except for the few years he spent in exile, remained there until his death in 1875. One of the reasons why the missionaries were so successful was the role played by missionary wives in facilitating contact with Malagasy households, especially the aristocratic ladies, to whom they offered the rudiments of household instruction and provided services such as those of seamstresses. 19 The most important technical assistance that Radama required was a modernized standing army on the British model. He recruited an army of about 15 000 men, equipped with good English guns from the Napoleonic Wars and even some light cannon. They were trained mainly by English instructors, the most important being Hastie and Brady. The resulting army was much better and more effective than those of his adversaries on the island, To sustain professional spirit, Radama I introduced a system of army ranks within the army, based on numbers of'honours', one honour for a private, and up to ten honours for a general.

The Queen and the Andafiavaratra clan in particular and the oligarchy in general could adopt this attitude of resistance to foreigners because, despite sporadic revolts, they were in control ofthe most important provinces, whose economy they controlled, including a monopoly on the beef trade. In this lies their determination to continue to promote Western education and establish industries to produce those goods which they needed but which could not now be imported from outside. In maintaining commercial contacts with the outside world, the Queen used the services of a French national called de Lastelle, who was established at Tamatave, and an American national called William Marks at Majunga. With the support of de Lastelle, sugar plantations were established on the eastern coast, and a factory was installed at Mahela producing sugar and rum.31 The Queen engaged Jean Laborde, a French adventurer, who arrived in Antananarivo in 1832 'as a kind of general superintendent of works'. He first established a factory at Ilafy, 10 km north of Antananarivo before moving to Mantasoa, on the edge of the eastern forest in a region rich in running water but where it was difficult to get the Malagasy to work willingly. At Mantasoa, with official backing, he established an industrial complex employing some 20000 workers. This produced various goods ranging from guns and cannon to glass and soap. Perhaps Laborde's greatest and most lasting creation was the wooden palace of the Queen, later enclosed in stone by Cameron, which now dominates Antananarivo. De Lastelle and Laborde became Malagasy citizens and were incorporated into the ruling oligarchy. 32 Queen Ranavalona continued the expansion which Radama I had begun and consolidated her administration in the conquered territories. The equipment of her army necessitated the prosecution of external trade to obtain ammunition and the encouragement of gun production at Laborde's factory. She levied special taxes for the support of the wars. The town of Fianarantsoa was created in 1831 as a regional capital, and the province of Betsileo was reorganized.

In December 1828 the Ranavalona's govern› ment told Robert Lyall, the new British Resident, that although they would not reintroduce the slave trade, they did not wish to continue with the treaty, nor did they consider his presence in their capital necessary any longer. Trade between Madagascar and the islands of Mauritius and RØunion was banned. General Brady, who had been naturalized as a Malagasy and given noble rank by Radama I, was forced into retirement in 1829. Madagascar's disillusionment with foreign powers was heightened when, in 1829, Charles X's government in France, desirous to raise its prestige at home, ordered the bombardment and occupation of Tintingue and Tamatave, following a series of misunderstandings with the Malagasy over the French presence at Tintingue, opposite the island of Sainte-Marie.

At the same time, a general attack will be directed against all Sakalavas or other native tribes guilty of intriguing with the invaders. The forces at the command of Queen Ranavalona seem amply sufficient for these operations. The regular army now amounts to 20,000 well-drilled troops, partly armed with breech-loaders, besides a horde of 50,000 spearmen, who would be fairly effective on an emergency.

We will preface a few extracts by one from the instructions given by the Governor to the embassy:—\n\nI may here repeat what I have already amply explained, that there is a clear understanding between the English and the French Governments, that no diplomatic step whatever, that may alter the present relations and state of things with Madagascar, is to be taken by either of these countries, without the full knowledge and consent of the other. With this fact in mind, all approach, or appearance of approach, to that point must be carefully avoided, in act and word, by all members of this mission.\n\nThe following from the report seems to dispose of the falsehoods of the French press about Prime Minister Lambert:—\n\nAlthough there is every disposition on the part of the King and his Government to welcome Europeans, and treat them with respect and kindness, there is yet no truth in the report that the King has sought their official counsel, and has appointed one among the European residents to fill an important executive office. Such a step would be entirely opposed to the spirit of the Madagascar Government.\n\nIn reference to the general joy manifested at the presence of the English, it says:—\n\nWe need not look for an explanation of this feeling. The missionary work, initiated thirty years ago, will sufficiently account for it. Nearly all the arts with which the people are acquainted were taught them by the missionaries, and your excellency will see with astonishment with what patience their workmen carry out any given task, and often with implements ill fitted for the performance of it.

The present Queen accepted these as the condition of her accession. The paragraph which we published last month from the French papers was one calculated to cause some inquietude, except that, as our friends of the London Missionary Society justly observe, ""Every communication since the death of the late King, coming through the French medium, has proved to be either greatly exaggerated or wholly unfounded. That a revolution so recent, so sudden, and involving the assassination of Radama, who had been greatly beloved by large classes of the people, should be followed by temporary disorder and acts of hostility on the part of outlying tribes, was naturally to be expected. Such events, we have every reason to believe, have actually occurred. The Sakalavas, for instance, have always been forward to assert their independence, and at least a part of that tribe appears to have seized the opportunity to make inroads and commit acts of plunder upon the property of the Hovas.""\n\nIn the last letter received from the Rev. Mr. Ellis (the only dependable authority), dated July 2, these acts of hostility are alluded to, and it would seem that the danger had passed away, and that representatives from the different native tribes were then in the capital, professing their allegiance to the Queen.""

They have all been most generously treated, admitted to the presence of the Queen, surrounded by all her officers, addressed kindly and encouragingly, as well as gratified by presents of cattle, &c., and are to-morrow to be entertained at a royal banquet at the palace. The affairs of the kingdom constitute now the business of the Government, in which Christians and Hovas are combined, promptitude and activity are everywhere apparent, and all parties are more careful in their public conduct. This state of things is not unfavourable to the Christians. The hereditary policy of the Hovas is \'Things as they have been;\' \'The wisdom of our ancestors cannot be surpassed.\' But so many innovations have turned out improvements and benefits, that the aim now seems to be to adopt what is good in the new, while retaining what they can of the old.

The surrounding country, which is, of course, also ceded, is described as being clad with primeval forests of magnificent timber, and pouring forth plenteously the richest produce of the tropics.\n\n""At the instigation of England, in 1822, the King of the Hovas assumed the title of King of Madagascar, but France energetically protested against the usurpation of the right to reign over an island which belongs to her. In 1840, the Sclavo princes of the north, our old and faithful allies, driven to desperation by English attempts to oust them, came in a body, and offered to cede their territories to Admiral Tell, Governor of the Island of Reunion. This offer was accepted in 1841, and since then France has occupied the islands in the vicinity of Diego Suarez—viz., Mayotte, Noja Bé, and Nossi Comba; and the Bay of Diego Suarez therefore belonged to France already.

THE COMMERCIAL OUTLOOK.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Commercially and industrially speaking, the coast of Madagascar may be divided into five great divisions. The first is the long stretch of east coast from Antongil Bay to Fort Dauphin, forming almost a straight line. It contains not a single really good natural harbour, nor a decently navigable river of any length, and most of its towns are only approached by dangerous roadsteads. From its geographical position it will easily be understood that its foreign element are mostly Mauritians. The natural resources of this coast have been to a great extent exhausted, and the prospects now lie principally in sugar-planting. The Mauritians are naturally acquainted with this industry, and there is a great future before them. Coffee is also a profitable undertaking, but it must not be planted at a lower elevation than 1,500 feet above the level of the sea. Spices of almost every kind can also be cultivated auxiliary to the sugar plantations. The second division is that called the North-east Coast, being that part between Antongil Bay and Cape Amber. It contains two or three harbours, but not very good ones. The forests here are much larger than in any other part, and consequently the natural supplies of India-rubber and gum-copal are still plentiful. This is the most thinly populated part of the island, but exceedingly fertile. Probably in a few more years the natural resources will be exhausted, and foreign residents will then have recourse to agriculture, with better results perhaps than can be obtained on any other part of the East Coast. The third division of the Coast is the North-west, from Cape Amber to Cape St. Andrew, and the part coveted by France. This part contains lignite deposits and valuable woods, and is full of good harbours. Its foreign element consists chiefly of Indians and Muslims, and a few French Creoles. The fourth division is the West Coast, properly called—i.e., from Cape St. Andrew North to St. Augustine South. Full of good harbours and navigable rivers, it is probably the finest part of Madagascar. The foreigners there are mostly Americans and Englishmen, who carry on a trade with the Cape and Natal. The fifth part is the Southern portion, from St. Augustine to Fort Dauphin, about which nothing is really known.\n\nIt will be seen, then, how little is yet known of the vast commercial resources of this island, and of the number of industries that may be opened. The trade of the last few months has been characterised by a little more activity, but at best can only be said to be very slack. The coast merchants are still prevented from exporting such articles as would afford supplies to the French armies, or were prevented up to a very short time ago. The wholesale trade in hides at Antananarivo has somewhat revived, but is far from satisfactory. Cottons are still high, and the American merchants are doing nothing.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-04-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1884#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MADAGASCAR', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The French papers have a constant succession of canards about Madagascar.

Steep mountain slopes and beetling cliffs overhang the sea, and are broken by many long and deep inlets.

Large numbers of native Africans from East Africa are taken over and sold to the Malays. In the port of Isalary alone, where some years ago American whalers made a rendezvous, no less than twenty ships were occasionally at anchor at one time. The Yankees are quite sensible of the advantages presented in the shape of maritime facilities by the many harbours of the western coast, and make good use of them.

471,"Gift-giving was a central diplomatic strategy in African societies, facilitating alliances, negotiations, and social stability through exchanges with both local and European leaders.","The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present differing perspectives on the role of gift-giving as a diplomatic strategy in African societies. The General History of Africa provides limited direct evidence to support the claim that gift-giving was a central diplomatic strategy, noting that no 'gifts' passed between Borno and Kano due to the lack of formal peace, which suggests that gift-giving was a recognized diplomatic practice. However, the textbook does not elaborate on gift-giving as a widespread or central strategy in facilitating alliances, negotiations, or social stability, instead emphasizing other diplomatic strategies such as treaties, alliances, and economic policies. This absence of detailed accounts of gift-giving in the context of European interactions suggests it was not highlighted as a central strategy in the historical narratives provided. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide several details supporting the claim that gift-giving was a central diplomatic strategy, facilitating alliances and negotiations through exchanges with both local and European leaders. The articles mention instances such as the coat of mail given to King Massaba, gifts from Mr. Craft to the King of Dahomey, and valuable presents from the King of Portugal to the King of the Congo. Additionally, the Ashantee messengers received cases of Moselle, and the new King of Ijebu sent sheep as presents to express his desire for friendly relations. These examples highlight the role of gift-giving in diplomatic interactions, aligning with the claim, although the articles do not explicitly discuss the impact of these exchanges on social stability. Overall, while the textbook suggests that gift-giving was not a central diplomatic strategy, the news articles provide evidence of its significance in diplomatic interactions, though they do not fully explore its broader implications for social stability.","The General History of Africa textbook provides limited direct evidence to support the claim that gift-giving was a central diplomatic strategy in African societies.

For instance, the articles mention the presentation of gifts to African kings, such as the coat of mail given to King Massaba, which pleased him and indicated that he was not forgotten in England. Similarly, the King of Dahomey received presents from Mr. Craft, which were repacked and sent up the country for presentation. The articles also describe the King of Portugal sending valuable presents to the King of the Congo, including silver basins, flags, and arms. Additionally, the Ashantee messengers received cases of Moselle after delivering the King's message, and the new King of Ijebu sent sheep as presents to Governor Moloney and other leaders to express his desire for friendly relations. These instances highlight the role of gift-giving in diplomatic interactions, aligning with the claim. However, the articles do not explicitly discuss the impact of these exchanges on social stability, which is an interesting difference from the claim. Overall, the articles provide evidence of gift-giving as a diplomatic tool, but they do not fully explore its broader implications for social stability.",True,471,Diplomatic Relations,Cultural Exchange,"[{'document_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate and Borno', 'section_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80 > Military and diplomatic activities', 'content': ""Finally, on the frontier with Borno, whose western territories had become the embryo emirates of Hadejia, Katagum, Missau and Gombe, the initial failure to reach a compromise (in the celebrated correspondence between Muhammad Bello and Shaykh al-Kanºmi during the djihäd) set the tone for the rest of the century.

These treaties took two forms - those between Africans and Europeans, and bilateral agreements between the Europeans themselves. The African-European treaties were basically of two kinds. Firstly, there were the slave trade and the commercial treaties; these had generated friction, which in turn led to European political interference in African affairs. Secondly, there were the political treaties by which African rulers either purportedly surrendered sovereignty in return for protection, or undertook not to enter into treaty obligations with other European nations.\nThese political treaties were in vogue during our period. They were made either by representatives of European governments or by those of private organizations who later transferred them to their respective govern› ments. If a metropolitan government accepted them, the territories in question were usually annexed or declared a protectorate; if, on the other hand, it suspected their authenticity, or if it felt constrained by the vicissi› tudes of Weltpolitik to exercise caution, these treaties were used for bargaining purposes during the bilateral European negotiations. Africans, on the other hand, entered into these arrangements for a variety of motives, but particularly because of the interests of their people. In some cases, they desired treaty relations with Europeans because they hoped that the prestige of such a relationship would endow them with certain political advantages in dealing with their neighbours. Sometimes a weak African state would desire a treaty with a European power in the hope of using it to renounce allegiance to another African state that claimed sovereignty over it. An African sovereign would also desire a treaty in the hope of using it to keep recalcitrant subject states in line. And sometimes a treaty with one European nation was seen by some African states as a means of preserving their independence which was being threatened by other European nations.$^{42}$ Whatever was the case, the African-European political treaties played an important role in the final partition of Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Central Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'The struggle to maintain independence: the era of confrontation and alliance', 'content': 'African rivalries, moreover, facilitated a strategy of divide and rule which Harry Johnston and other colonial officials employed with consum› mate skill.

The Inhambane Tonga and the Sena helped the Portuguese against their respective Shangaan and Barue overlords, while in the Congo a number of subject people co-operated with the Belgians to free themselves from Yeke and Arab rule or from the slave raiders. In addition, several African leaders recognized that alliances with the Europeans could fulfil their expansionist aspirations and simultaneously strengthen their own internal position. Such considera› tions, for example, motivated Tippu Tib and the sons of Msiri to aid the Congo Free State.$^{28}$ Other African societies, including some which initially opposed the invaders, later allied$^{29}$ with them in exchange for material benefits and promises of improved status in the new colonial order.

As we have seen above, the fundamental issue at stake between the 1880s and the 1900s as far as the African rulers were concerned, was that of sove› reignty, and on this, it was quite clear that nobody was prepared to compromise. Those African rulers who have been mistakenly termed collaborators were those who thought that the best way of safeguarding their sovereignty or even regaining the sovereignty that they might have lost to some African power previous to the arrival of the Europeans was not to collaborate but rather to ally with the European invaders. A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation. But as we have seen, the Africans were all faced with the question of surrendering, retaining or regaining their sovereignty.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains.

In various places, missionaries seeking converts often received a warm welcome from African rulers who, although very jealous of their inde- pendence and not keen to have their people converted, saw in missionary activities a possible access route to European education which might teach literacy and technical skills such as carpentry, printing and, if possible, also the manufacture of guns and gunpowder. The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

There the local matrilineages were able to gain control of the slave trade, at the expense of the royal family, leading to the rapid fragmentation of the state. 69 One by-product of greater commercial interaction was the substantial amount of cultural borrowing that occurred between different societies. The direction of change varied appreciably, depending on such factors as the nature and duration of contact between the trading groups and the host population. Where interaction was substantial, three broad patterns of acculturation occurred. In several instances, isolated bands of merchants and raiders became totally absorbed into the local society, as in the case of the Chikunda hunters, who were incorporated into Nsenga, Ambo and valley Tonga communities.$^{70}$ In sharply contrasting situations, the aliens profoundly altered the host culture. The Chewa subjects of Khota Khota, for example, absorbed aspects of Islam into their religion, adopted Swahili names, Swahili words and phrases, and underwent a major restructuring of their social system.$^{71}$ Similarly, many Yao traders converted to Islam and adopted coastal cultural patterns as a result of their contact with the Arabs. Their participation in long-distance trade also led to the growth of urban centres and the development of rituals and prohibitions designed to ensure the fidelity of Yao women while their husbands were in the interior, 72 suggesting that change also occurred as societies modified internal struc› tures to meet new external conditions. In addition to these two patterns of acculturation, there are indications that the fluid conditions facilitated the development of new ethnic and cultural groups. Several of the bands of Chikunda broke away from the decaying prazo system around the middle of the century and organized autonomous communities in the Luangwa valley. Attracting followers from a variety of disparate ethnic groups, they evolved a culture incorporating diverse Malawian and Shona institutions and values.$^{73}$ A parallel phenomenon occurred in the area of what is now eastern Zaire where the Manyema were transformed from a disparate band of slavers into a coherent social and cultural group. 74', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': 'Viewed from a somewhat different perspective, the unequal value of commodities exchanged reflects the fragile position of the region within the larger international trading system.

Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary.

The reputation and resources of Tuskegee, however, were brought to Africa by African and American alumni and, often, by numerous African visitors to Tuskegee or correspondents with Washington who had never been matriculated students.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

The very atmosphere was electric with the most wonderful schemes—religious, philanthropic, and commercial—for the exclusive benefit of the negro. From platform and pulpit rose a clamour of voices, in which was heard the popular watchwords of the day—civilisation, progress, the good of the negro, legitimate commerce, conversion of the heathen, and other high-sounding phrases, all having relation to the good things to be done for the African. The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation. They never heard now of the trader who went to Africa with the merely selfish object of making his fortune. Each and all became pioneers of civilisation, thinking only of the native first and self afterwards. They spoke as if the good to the native had been enormous, and that their intercourse with him had been a benefit and blessing.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

People feel jealous of being advised by foreigners; they feel that there is an assumption of superiority of wisdom and virtue; and selfish motives are attributed to the advisers. Now, I venture to think that this objection does not apply in the slightest degree to the meeting to-day. Some eighteen months ago her Majesty\'s Government made a proposal, not that we should go and teach other countries what was to be done about the slave trade, but assuming that all European nations are now inclined to carry out principles which have been proclaimed both by treaty and international communications for some seventy-five years. As against the slave trade, the Government felt that the moment had come when other countries desired to give practical effect to that policy. Lord Salisbury selected perhaps the individual who was best qualified for the duty to preside over the Conference of European Powers. I therefore accepted the invitation to come here with very great pleasure. I received a little shock when I saw in the newspapers that objections were made to our meeting by a society for which I have the very greatest possible respect—that important historical society, the Anti-Slavery Society. It is now more than fifty years ago, very soon after the Aborigines\' Protection Society was established, that I entered office under Lord Palmerston. The strongest political feeling Lord Palmerston had was his horror of the slave trade, and his determination to put it down, and no one who was not in the Foreign Office at the time with him could hardly be aware of the immense amount of energy and labour he devoted to the attainment of that object. Under these circumstances I was naturally in communication with the Anti-Slavery Society—and I have at times been in communication with it ever since. I say that any objection from the Anti-Slavery Society, or any communication from it, would come with great authority. I own that if the objection taken had been that our objects were unworthy, I should have been very much shaken. But it is not so; they agree with us entirely in thinking that this question of the supply of arms to the slave-traders and the question of the supply of alcohol to a great multitude of the African population is one of the most serious and dangerous importance. Their objection rests on a question of tactics. They think that there are two questions already brought before the Conference of vital importance, and that they might be endangered by any other question being raised there at all. But on this question I am not sure that the Anti-Slavery Society speak with greater authority than any other body of men. What is our position here? You have heard the first resolution. Other resolutions to be proposed will set out the prominent causes of the mischief, and the final resolution will be ""That copies of the foregoing resolutions be forwarded to his Majesty the King of the Belgians, the president of the International Conference, her Majesty\'s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and her Majesty\'s Minister at the Belgian Court."" There is nothing compulsory in that, and if Lord Salisbury and the King of the Belgians and Lord Vivian are of opinion that no new subject should be brought before the Conference, supposing they think it better to keep these resolutions a little in the background, in what way can our recommendations of today interfere with such a decision? If, they think that these subjects are so closely interweaved that they would not interfere with the general consent of the European Powers. I venture to think that it would strengthen the hands of Lord Salisbury and Lord Vivian, that a meeting under the presidency of the Lord Mayor had passed these resolutions. I said that it was a wise step to ask the King of the Belgians to take the initiative in this matter of the Conference. I think that it is impossible not to recognise why he has the greatest claims and qualifications for the task. In recent years we have seen men of great wealth making magnificent contributions to objects of philanthropy. The King of the Belgians has this pleasant characteristic, but none of the contributions approached in wideness of scope those of the King of the Belgians. We see what he has done, for instance, by the creation of the Congo State. He has not only given time and most anxious care to the affairs of the State—his contributions in a pecuniary sense are perfectly enormous. The official returns show the cost to be about £70,000 a year, and the whole comes from the King of the Belgians, not as Sovereign, but as a private individual from his private means. I have reason to believe that hundreds of thousands beyond that have been spent by him in this great work, and I think it is satisfactory that the King of the Belgians accepted the presidency of the Conference, the object of which is to give practical effect to principles which have really been sanctioned by the whole of Europe for some seventy-five years. I think it is becoming that this meeting we should commence operations by giving a vote of thanks to the King of the Belgians for the part he has taken in this important affair.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains.

The themes of African redemption through American black missionaries were another.\nAfricans themselves, however, created the context of their next interaction with American blacks as they matriculated at American, largely Afro-American, schools and attended pan-African conferences and the like. Consequently, many Africans underwent a technical-educationalpolitical experience alien to their colonial world.

One was a vision of the union of religious forces among black populations in Africa and America or the reconstruction of Africa through importation of American and Antillean black technical expertise, initiated at the behest of American blacks. Another reflected the transformation of Africans from predicate to subject during the colonial period. The latter was a vision of the spiritual redemption, social recon› struction, and political reformation of African communities through the repatriation of African personnel and the energizing of African resources. Because of this vision, Africans had been educated in American schools, or sent to participate in technical and commercial activities; others were touched by American black writings or by anti-colonial ventures organized among blacks of the diaspora.

Only African populations of certain regions were initially involved in inter› action with American and Caribbean blacks. Those regions involved early in our period were the ones which became the focus of American black emigration or evangelism, particularly West Africa, South Africa, and the Horn. Peoples of other regions became involved because of the penetration of their region by pan-Africanist projects, American black writings, folk› lore, and the like, or more importantly, because of the initiatives of school leavers who went, in growing numbers from all over the African continent, to America for higher education.\nPerspectives were undoubtedly affected by direct and substantial inter› action of Africans within a particular black environment or set of influences. Exactly how much is anybody's guess. The effect of colonial African experience with American blacks appears, nevertheless, unique and vital in terms of subsequent social and political activities. For some, the American black component within African nationalist ideology and strategies emerging during the colonial period was striking and unequivocal. In the view of others, for example some African students, interactions within American black arenas were disappointing and unrewarding. The caustic assessment of one such visitor illustrates the latter point: 'One of the things I had decided to find out during my stay in America was the condition of the descendants of former slaves brought here from Africa ... I feel safe in saying that, so far as economic and material progress are concerned the Negro in America is on the average ahead of the West African, but when it comes to integrity and genuine manhood, the American Negro is far below him.' 75 Another view was that many Afro-American missionaries who viewed Africans as 'poor heathen savages' must bear some of the responsibility for perpetuating a distorted and pernicious picture of Africa and Africans in the minds of their fellow American blacks. In other words, in their sedulous campaign to recruit American black workers for foreign missions, missionary churches undoubtedly succumbed occasionally to the tempta- tion of portraying an exotic, erotic and socially inferior Africa much in need of great sacrifice, hard work, and alien redemption."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The western diaspora: background to the nineteenth century', 'content': 'Before 1600, the Americas were truly the hegemonic preserve of the Iberians, and so the Spanish and the Portuguese divided the Africans who came to the New World during that time, with the Spanish getting about 60 per cent, or more than 125 ooo.$^{38}$ Those Africans helped maintain social viability, while the new diseases introduced by the incoming Europeans and Africans decimated the local indigenous Indian populations, especially in the highlands of Mexico and Peru.$^{39}$ Considering the later history of the African in the New World, it is interesting to note that at the end of the sixteenth century, Africans in general considered themselves superior to the local Indians, and treated them with the same arrogance and con› descension that their fellow Spanish did in Spanish America. 40 About a million and a half Africans came to the Americas during the seventeenth century. Of this number, 41 per cent went to Brazil, 35 per cent went to the fledgling British, Dutch and French colonies (mainly in the circum-Caribbean region), and 22 per cent went to Spanish America. This was the period in which the fully organized, highly capitalized transAtlantic slave trade began. The annual average importation rate rose from about 1800 Africans during the sixteenth century, to more than 17 000. The declining relative participation of the Spanish reflected the demographic recovery of the mainland Indian populations. But the slack in the Spanish sector was more than compensated for by the increasing demand for labourers in the expanding Brazilian sugar zones of the north-east, and the developing socio-economic complex based on sugar production in the eastern Caribbean islands.\nThe eighteenth century constituted the apogee of the African migration to the Americas. Both the plantation societies in the Americas and the slave trade which supplied the manpower needs reached their fullest maturity. Between 1700 and 1810 more than half of all the Africans ever to come to the New World arrived: perhaps far more than 6 million Africans.

Living in the forest, groups in Suriname and in French Guiana have retained more or less intact their fundamental cultural values and a certain social organization. The maroons were communities of run› away slaves who took refuge in the mountains of those countries, thus cutting themselves off from contact with the colonizers. At least a good portion of these communities succeeded in maintaining themselves isolated from the former colonizers. Later on, in Suriname, French Guiana and, to a certain extent, in Jamaica, they held themselves aloof from what could be called the 'national community'.\nFrom the demographic standpoint, the composition of the population of each country should be carefully checked with reference to three main groups: the population of African origin, that of European origin and, lastly, that of local origin - the 'Amerindians'. The demographic survival of each group as such and the result of cross-breeding between several different groups, as the case may be, should also be considered."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A common pattern of the movement of cultural forms and their concrete manifestations, the incident provides an apt model of survival, even renewal of cultural values in the face of religious and other more socially intensive forms of domination.

In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers.

But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories.

In some cases, the influences from Africa were strong enough and pervasive enough to forge a genuine Afro-American culture competing with, and sometimes complementing the Europeanderived culture.\nIn the USA the political-structure imposed a rigid dichotomy between black and white in the population, relegating any individual with any degree of African ancestry to the category of black.$^{51}$ By contrast, throughout the rest of the hemisphere a three-tiered social categorization prevailed, corres› ponding to the dominant groups of black, mixed, and white. The relatively small number of white persons at the top of the social pyramid in most societies afforded the dominant African majorities the opportunity to impose their values and their cultures on the rest of the society.\nWithin the three-tiered structure each caste had its own set of legal rights and social privileges based on a combination of wealth, colour and occupation. In the sugar and plantation-based economic zones of Brazil, the Caribbean, and the lowlands of Mexico, Colombia and Peru, the rights of slaves as well as free persons of colour tended to be circumscribed in direct proportion to the overall demands of their labour.

The expedition, about 300 strong, was under the command of the Company\'s officer, Mr. Charles Macintosh, who had with him a staff of two or three other Europeans; a part of his convoy consisted of the Houssa troops of the Company, and the remainder was made up of porters bearing food and equipment for the party, together with a liberal supply of presents for the monarch whom it was hoped to propitiate. The whole party were fully armed, but their instructions were to regard themselves as a strictly peaceful mission, and to take every precaution to avoid bloodshed. As the country between the Benue and Lake Tchad was unknown, food was taken for the whole journey. A draft treaty between the Niger Company and the Sultan of Bornou was confided to the diplomatic care of Mr. Macintosh to negotiate if possible. The party left Ribago, on the Benue, in October, and struck in a due northerly direction for Kouka. The distance as the crow flies is something less than 250 miles, not so far as from London to Durham. It was traversed at the rate of ten or twelve miles a day, and after three weeks\' travelling, the expedition arrived at the Court of Bornou. Scientific observations of the country were taken on the way. The natives, from whom nothing was requested, were not otherwise than friendly. At Kouka, which is a considerable town, with a population of about 120,000, and regarded as the western terminus of Mohammedan civilisation in Central Africa, the arrival of Europeans created no small sensation. The Embassy was well received by the Sultan, who assigned it quarters in the town, and was pleased to accept as a preliminary to negotiations some portion of the presents which were offered to him. Two months of Oriental dilly-dally followed, during which time the officers of the Company made use of their opportunity to acquire political and commercial information relating to Bornou and its sister States. Arabs from all quarters thronged about them, and the Houssa language, which is the _lingua franca_ of the Central States, served as a medium of communication. Political factions abound at the Court of Kouka as elsewhere; but the result left in the minds of Mr. Macintosh and his companions after prolonged discussion with the various leaders is that all factions unite in a determination to repel the approach of Western civilisation. Bornou draws all its knowledge of the outer world from the reports of pilgrims and caravans travelling to Mecca and other centres of the East. The Mahdist disturbances in the Soudan, which have forced pilgrims to Mecca, to pass by way of Cairo, have had the effect, as regards Bornou, of keeping it better informed than it was before of the progress of the world\'s affairs, and have contributed to weld it and the neighbouring States more closely to the Eastern and Mohammedan as opposed to the Western and Christian system. The power and influence of Senousism in the Central States have not been, so far as the Niger Mission was able to ascertain, in any sense over-estimated by general report. Religious fanaticism supported by the sword is the prevailing spirit of government in Bornou. A well-established current of trade with the East and long-standing political traditions at present serve to combine all interests against European intrusion. It is neither England nor France nor Germany which is feared, but the European as European, the revolution of steam and enlightenment and liberty as against the camel and ignorance and despotism. The persistence of the European is well known, but while he presents himself in the peaceful guise of a trader only arms will suffice to drive him back. There is not a caravan which comes across the desert that does not bring evidence of the fact that, whether in Egypt, or Tripoli, or Turkey, the European, once admitted, reduces the Oriental to submission. The East has but one story. Bornou is of the East, and it stands in the position of a man who has never tasted wine and who sees his neighbour drunk. He realises all the consequences; he has never experienced the force of the circumstances which have produced them. The Sultan of Bornou and his advisers say in their pride, ""The evil has all come from having dealings with the West. We will have no dealings with the West, unless they are imposed upon us by force of arms.""', 'last_edit_date': '1891-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1891#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.634, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE AFRICAN PROBLEM', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In the fifteenth century the Congo country was the scene of extensive operations. Just a little before the discovery of America thousands of the natives of the Congo were baptised by Catholic missionaries, and the Portuguese devoted themselves to the work of African evangelisation and exploration. They knew then as much of interior Africa as is known now after the great exploits of Livingstone and Stanley. There is a map in the Vatican, 300 years old, which gives the general physical relief and the river and lake systems of Africa with more or less accuracy; but the Arab geographers of a century before had described the mountain system, the great lakes, and the course of the Nile. Just about the time that Portugal was establishing a great empire on that continent, America was discovered, and it became the seat of Portuguese Power. Neither Egyptian, Carthaginian, Persian, or Roman influence was allowed to establish itself on that continent. It would seem that no solution of the African problem was to come from alien sources. Africans were not to share the fate of other dark races who have come in contact with the European. Europe was diverted to the Western Hemisphere. The energies of that conquering race were spent in building up a home for themselves on this side. Africa followed in chains.\n\nThe Negro race was to be preserved for a special work in the future. It is probable that if foreign races had been allowed to enter their country they would have been destroyed. So they were brought over to be helpers in America and at the same time to be preserved. Slavery would seem to be a strange school in which to preserve a people; but God has a way of salting as well as purifying by fire. The Europeans found in America an aboriginal race unable to co-operate with them in the labours required for the construction of the new civilisation. The Indians would not work, and have suffered the consequences of that indisposition: they have passed away. To take their place as accessories in the work to be done, the African was brought, who could work and would work, and could endure the climatic conditions of a new southern country, which Europeans could not. If Europe brought the Negro, Africa furnished the hands for the work which has been achieved. But when the new continent was opened Africa was closed.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

He did not marry the daughter of Mirambo, as has been stated, but a negress whom he rescued from slavery. He was formerly employed at Zanzibar, but subsequently took to travelling in Africa and carrying on the ivory trade. The English often tried to purchase his services, but without success, for he does not like them. However, forced by necessity, he has accepted their offers, and is now conducting a caravan of merchandise for the English.\n\nAs regards one of the monarchs of Africa, the Abbé says: ""Mirambo enjoys in Europe a reputation far beyond his merits. He is a cruel tyrant, whose caprice is the only law known. His army reckons scarcely more than four hundred men. If he does not make the Europeans pay the right of passage, he knows how to make up for it in another and far more advantageous way. He proposes to every white man who crosses his country the pact of blood.

He says: ""The English occupy Mpapona, which is a strategical position of the first order. All the routes which lead to Unyamezi pass by it. It is not six months that they have been there, and already four handsome stone houses have been built. A clergyman, a mason, and a carpenter compose all the personnel of the station. They are eminently practical men. The English have founded another station in the Ukereone, a third in the Uganda, and a fourth at Ujiji. The power of the Arabs in these parts is decreasing daily. The ivory trade no longer satisfies their wants, and as the slave-trade is prohibited, they will soon be forced to leave the colonies which they have founded in the interior of Africa, and the English will take their place.', 'last_edit_date': '1879-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1879#article-26', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.634, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE PARTITION OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'most advanced of the Native States of the African continent, whose territory had been the prey of outside Powers, and he showed that the dawn of African exploration and partition commenced with the Phoenicians, who navigated the Mediterranean for an unknown period, and founded the city of Utica about 1,100 B.C., nearly 300 years before the foundation of Carthage. The Phoenicians treated the part of Africa which they colonised as the British would, as the foundation of trade and commerce. The Phoenicians were followed, about 650 B.C., by the Greeks, who founded their first African colony Cyrene, on the coast of Tripoli. Then came the Carthaginians. They and the Greeks carried on a busy commerce all along the Mediterranean coast, far down to the Atlantic coast, to the mouth of the Red Sea. These were followed by the Romans, who continued an active career on the African coast until the decay of the Roman Empire.\n\nMr. Scott Keltie showed how little was known of the interior of Africa up to 150 A.D. by Ptolemy\'s map being thrown on to the sheet in the darkened theatre. This map, which was filled up haphazard fashion, gathered up, the lecturer said, all the knowledge of the continent which had accumulated during this long period of commercial activity — a knowledge which amounted to very little beyond the coasts and the Nile Valley. The next important period dealt with was the period of Arab invasion and the spread of the tenets of Mohammedanism — namely, from the seventh to the fifteenth century. In the early part of the fifteenth century commenced the ""glorious"" period of Portuguese activity, which lasted for some sixty years, during which the contour of the coast of Africa was completely laid down. This began the real modern partition of Africa, and the lecturer dwelt upon the effect which could be traced to Portuguese occupation of African territory — that occupation being marked by ruin rather than by enterprise. He rapidly traced the occupation of points of territory by Portuguese, Spanish, French, English, Dutch, Danish, and Germans, whose commerce was in ivory and slaves. He held that the opening up of the continent of Africa might be said to have begun with Bruce\'s travels in Abyssinia in the latter part of the eighteenth century. From that time until 1850 nearly the whole map of Africa became gradually filled up, and from 1850 down to the present day the southern half of the continent had received increasing attention at the hands of explorers until it also had had its main features laid down.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills. Ivory has all but disappeared. Ebony and other woods are increasing in volume, and cocoa quickly rising into importance, as well as rubber.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MR.

They must not if they could, and they ought not even if they wanted. They had laid themselves under an overwhelming load of debt to the African that centuries of beneficial work could never repay, and it would be well if they heard less about high-sounding words, schemes for the suppression of the African slave trade, and more practicable proposals for the stoppage of their equally ruin-working commerce in spirits and weapons of destruction.

England, France, Portugal, Germany, and Italy are attempting to obtain titles to the country. England has made annexation of the coast lying adjacent to her colony of Sierra Leone; France is forcing her way on the Senegal and toward the head-waters of the Niger; she threatens to annex the coast from the Gaboon to the Congo, some 250 miles, and is running her lines on the Upper Congo. Her Chamber of Deputies has granted the De Brazza mission, by a vote of 449 to 3, a credit of a million and a quarter of francs. The Portuguese Government has appointed explorers and examined the Congo country, and assumes to exercise control over all the territory at the mouth of the Congo. The German Reichstag has increased its annual appropriation for the exploration of Africa. Italy has despatched a party to Abyssinia for geographical and mercantile purposes. She has also concluded treaties which promise to make Assab a centre of commerce. The Sultan of Morocco has authorized Spain to take possession of Santa Cruz del Mar, and the Sultan of Zanzibar has purchased six superior steamers to constitute a regular coast service, in the interest of commerce and for the suppression of the slave-trade. The International African Association, which owes its origin to the philanthropic initiative of Leopold II., King of the Belgians, has received large subscriptions and pushed forward exploring expeditions to start and equip the line of hospitable and scientific stations which are to bound the East and West Coast, and form a civilizing girdle around Central Africa. And the results following the explorations of Livingstone and Stanley and De Brazza are attracting the attention of the civilized world. What was a \'Dark Continent,\' by the indomitable energy of these explorers, seems likely to prove the richest quarter of the globe. Not only does the land produce, with slight persuasion of tillage, admirable crops of cotton and coffee, but the soil is rich in diamonds on its southern coast, and in iron on its northern.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa.

It is an admirable volume for all who desire general information respecting that great continent, into the dense darkness of which the light of civilization and Christianity has begun to penetrate, through the devoted exertions of missionaries and scientific explorers. Africa does not present us with any very pleasing pictures. They are all of barbarism, and for the most part barbarism of the lowest and most disgusting type, and yet such as awakes and impels to active exertion the warmest sympathies and desires of the Christian and philanthropist. Such books as this of Mr. Stanford\'s are particularly valuable in view of the extremely limited degree of information respecting Africa possessed even by the majority of well-educated people in England. So many active agencies are now at work in and for Africa that some more intimate knowledge of it must be desired; while yet the labour of wading through long and dreary books of African travel, with their sadly monotonous succession of pictures of sparsely-inhabited countries, and of ignorance, suffering, cruelty, and moral degradation everywhere, deters most people from seeking it in their pages.

494,"Symbolic gestures, such as the sending of a golden axe, played a crucial role in Ashanti diplomacy and military strategy, reflecting a rich cultural tradition that intertwined ritual with political relations, and were pivotal in interactions with the British.","The observations from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles together provide a nuanced understanding of the role of symbolic gestures in Ashanti diplomacy and military strategy. While the textbook does not explicitly mention the sending of a golden axe, it underscores the importance of symbolic objects and rituals in Ashanti culture, particularly highlighting the Golden Stool as the embodiment of the Asante soul and a symbol of their national survival. The British governor's demand for the Golden Stool, which led to the Asante uprising of 1900, illustrates the critical role of symbolic gestures in Ashanti interactions with the British. In contrast, The African Times articles specifically mention the golden axe, detailing its use as a diplomatic and military symbol.

But the last straw that really precipitated action was the demand of the British governor, Arnold Hodgson, for the Golden Stool to be sent to him so that he could sit on it. The Golden Stool was the most sacred object of the Asante, which they considered as the embodiment of their soul and a symbol of their survival as a nation. That demand, therefore, could not but touch off an instantaneous rebellion of nearly all the principal states under the leadership of the Queen of Edweso, Nana Yaa Asantewaa (see Plate 6.2). 64 The Asante forces attacked the Governor and his party who had to seek refuge in the fort at Kumasi which the Asante then besieged. When the governor and his party escaped from the fort, the Asante fought several pitched battles with the British which lasted from April to November 1900 when Yaa Asantewaa was arrested and deported with other Asante generals to the Seychelles.\nSimilar revolts, pitched battles and guerrilla warfare raged in the Ivory Coast in response to the brutal methods including forced labour and high taxation used by that cruel Governor, Angoulvant, for the consolidation of French rule and the exploitation of the colony. This resistance by the Baule which broke out in 1908 continued until 1910 when, using the notorious search and destroy tactics, the French suppressed all remain› ing opposition with a brutality and wickedness unparalleled in the annals of African resistance (see Plate 6.5a).

There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': ""The third category of states included geographically and culturally distant peoples such as the Dagomba, the Mamprusi and the Gonja. They were viewed by the Asante authorities primarily as having to contribute to the economic development of the metropolis. These non-Akan states to the north were subjected to military and political control because of their economic resources. They also supplied, in the form of tribute, a large part of the manpower used in Asante wars and agriculture.$^{13}$ This significant distinction has been contested on the grounds that economic and political motivations existed in all the Asante wars. In a similar vein, references have been made to the presence of Asante representatives in all types of states and also to the introduction of substantial Asante features into the Dagomba army or interventions by the Asantehene in Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes. 14 It is obvious nevertheless that the mandates of the Asante regional commissioners varied according to the situation. In the Akan regions they had to ensure that disputes were settled by enforcing observance of the Asantehene's oath so as to emphasize his sovereignty over these territories.

In non-Akan regions, the com¬ missioners strove to strengthen the terms of the 'treaty' between the Asantehene and the Dagomba, for example,16 concerning the tribute. On the other hand, we have no evidence confirming the presence of Gonja or Dagomba contingents in the Asante army or of payment by these countries of the Asante war tax (apeatoo). The settlement of the Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes must therefore be considered as a political act with economic motives: peace in these territories guaranteed payment of the tribute, as well as the introduction of Asante institutions into the Dagomba army.

He had a twofold objective: to keep Asante at bay and to bring the coastal peoples under his control. He therefore had a tripartite FanteBritish-Asante treaty signed whereby the parties recognized the inde› pendence of the coastal countries south of the Pra river, agreed to bring any conflict before the British party and undertook to keep trade routes open. Maclean tried gradually to acquaint the Fante with English legal principles through a hierarchy of courts ranging from the chiefs' courts to those over which he himself presided.

Less effective were embargoes on the export or import of items such as horses, weapons, salt or types of cloth, while an indiscriminate blockade of towns or areas was difficult to sustain, not least because smuggling offered high profits. But the disruption in the normal flow of caliphal trade caused for example by Ningi and Mbutawa raids was serious enough to require a remedy. Indeed their own experience of severe food shortages and the interruption of the grain trade during the djifiàd had made men like Muhammad Bello acutely aware of the importance of encouraging traders by keeping roads open, establishing markets and enforcing the laws regulating fair trading. In consequence, as the caliphal economy became relatively more efficient and neighbouring peoples depended more heavily on caliphal trade and traders, economic policy was increasingly a more effective instrument of power than warfare.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.624, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'The Nguni invasion', 'content': 'and build up centralized political entities.

First, we were told that three armies were marching towards the protected territories (one towards Cape Coast; the second to attack Agyemang, chief of a part of Akim, who was fighting with the other Akim chief, Ata, in 1859-60, and retired westward to Soedru; and the third towards the river Volta). Soon afterwards a messenger from Kumassie arrived at Kyebi in due form (i.e., with a gilt sword, as a sign that he is sent by the King of Ashantee), who said that \'the Ashantees will not fight with Ata—they are not Ata\'s enemies.\' But the Akim do not believe him, and keep a strict watch at the frontiers, as it might be a ruse. The messenger further stated: \'Agyemang (the chief of Soedru, who was in former times under Ashantee rule, but withdrew to Akim, and is therefore not a good friend of Ashantee, but attached to the English Government) has killed an Ashantee man, and has stigmatised others by cutting marks in their faces, as the Donkos have them (which are slaves in our country), and has sent them back to Ashantee. He intended to hint to the King of Ashantee that he considers him not better than a despised Donko. This made Kwako Duah, King of Ashantee, angry, who has sent his warriors to catch Agyemang. But this wicked man has run away to Fantee. Therefore Kwako Duah has sent a messenger to Ata, to tell him that he has nothing to fear.\' This is the message.

On the 18th January an Ashantee Prince, who had escaped from Coomassie, entreated British protection; next day a messenger from the King of Ashanti, bearing his gold axe and accompanied by Ambassadors, one being Saibee Enguie, who signed the Treaty of Peace with Sir Garnet Wolseley at Fomannah, requested an audience, when they demanded that the refugee should be given up to them. I declined; whereupon Enguie, supported by the other, stated that if I did not surrender the man the King of Ashanti would attack Assim. I called Enguie’s attention to the Treaty (Articles I. and III.), and warned him that the consequences of breaking them would be very serious. The messenger and suite then left, but I subsequently instructed them to remain at Cape Coast until to-day, considering it best to put my reply to the King’s demand in writing. The refusal of a demand from Ashanti, accompanied by the gold axe, means war on the part of Ashanti—that they will cut their way to the accomplishment of their purpose. The gold axe was sent down in 1873, and war followed. All chiefs, public officers, and respectable merchants warned me to prepare for war with the Ashantees, and that it is imminent.

Their message is to delivered officially at Elmina, but on the 17th inst. they had an unofficial interview with Sir Samuel Rowe, at which he was made acquainted with the purport of the message in question. The interview was strictly private, but it is understood that the King throws the blame of the present complication on Lieutenant-Governor Griffiths' haste in acting on a misinterpreted message, and declares that the warlike intentions imputed to him are merely the slander of his enemies. The mistake having been made by a messenger sent by him, however, rather than disown his own messenger, he is prepared to take the consequences, and entreats the Governor to intercede for him with the Queen of England. With regard to terms, he leaves himself in the Governor's hands. It is reported that, while asking the Governor's intercession, the Ambassador knelt down and embraced the Governor's knees—a sign of great and entire submission. The other chiefs and messengers are reported to have spoken to the same effect. The message is to be delivered at Elmina. At the request of the Ambassador himself, all the chiefs of the colony are being summoned to Elmina to hear it.

On the 26th of October last, the day on which the poor Queen Affracooma died, the Djuabeng Royal Stool, for which she had contended with her father, Assafo Adgaye; (the little niece, Ammah Sewah, daughter of the late Queen\'s sister, is still a war prisoner in the hands of the King of Ashanti;) the deceased\'s property and Adgaye\'s two principal chiefs, named Achiapong Acquasie and Banarhenne, were taken to James Fort and locked up through Mr. ——\'s devices to the late Governor, Mr. Ussher. Consequently, on the 26th November, Mr. —— despatched from this place three respective messengers, one of whom was the same man whom Mr. —— suborned in the palaver with Adgaye to give evidence against Adgaye. Mr. ——\'s message to them to deliver to His Majesty the King of Ashanti was this: ""That he has accomplished the task which he undertook to do for him; and, to show the King that his pretences are not delusive, he has subtly had the Kings Amoakoo Attah, of Eastern Akian, and Tackie, of Accra, and Adgaye transported by the Governor. The Governor is now willing that the King should take back all his runaway subjects, the Adansis included, and whomsoever the King chooses to have. The Governor has also secured on hand for the King to send for at once the Djuabeng Royal Stool, which the late Queen, in contention with her father, Adgaye, about it, had died in consequence. However, through his devices for the benefit of the King, the Governor has taken it for the King, and the late Queen\'s body, which he has interred in his father\'s house to effect the disinterment thereof easily, together with all I have before mentioned, and the Adansis."" These messengers delivered the message in a large assemblage on Thursday, the 13th January last, which being the next day after the great annual yam feast day, Coomassie was, especially for the hearing of these messages, thickly crowded, (and through this the new refugee, Owoosoo Tassey Mandee, easily effected his escape from Coomassie). Whatever might be the King\'s decision as to the course he should take to carry out the advice of Mr. —— in seizing at once the Adansis was given secretly, but happily in three or four days afterwards the report reached him of Owoosoo\'s escape. This Owoosoo Tassey Mandee and the other, Owoosoo Brempong, I mentioned in my last letter are half-brothers, sons of the King\'s late uncle, Osei Quargoe. On hearing this report the King, having been already dignified by the false message of Mr. ——, thought that he had reached the might of his ancestor, Osei Essipey, whose nickname he flatters himself with (""Bonsoe,"" the ""Whale""). He sent down the gold axe, which has been noted as an emblem since the Ashanti invasion of Anamaboe in 1808 to cut down the wood to punish his slaves, the Fantis. ""If you don\'t do what I demanded of you I would come down and chastise you."" It is a fact that when I heard that I feared, from the fact that I know, according to Mr. ——\'s message to the King of Ashanti, that the late Governor had sold me and mine to the King of Ashanti in the manner in which he (the late Governor) dare to do it, what was dictated to him by Mr. ——. From the fact that Mr. ——, in my own sound hearing, has sent such a scandalous message to the King to send for his runaway subjects and the Adansis, even the body of a queen who has died and been buried, and whomsoever the King likes. The fact of the late Governor, through the devices of Mr. ——, having ventured to transport without a cause, but simply for the benefit of the King of Ashanti, the Kings Amoakoo Attah, Tackie, and Adgaye—in the matter of the latter two kings without the privilege of a trial—I summed up conclusively, that if King Mensah has promised the Lieutenant-Governor that on his refusal to surrender up Owoosoo, he would come down and chastise the Assins, my allies, he will surely make an access on me. From these circumstances, I beg to urge that my fears are not groundless, and Mr. —— professing to have prophesied, as he stated in his aforementioned letter, that ""the King of Ashanti has done what he has all along predicted the King would do"" was false and a great falsehood; he has forgotten that he had told us one great falsehood beforehand. Just at the beginning of the alarm that it was 6,000 men whom the King of Ashantee has sent down to make funeral customs for his deceased families, and General Nanchuie, of Ashanti, whom he has disgracefully victimized by his swindling charms, and the late Queen Affracooma and the late Governor Ussher were those seen by the Assins, which they reported to the Lieutenant-Governor that the Ashantees are invading the Protectorate, not knowing that since the alarm was made we are aware that he has sent one Appiah, the King\'s State keys carrier, to Coomassie (to reach in four days) and tell the King to abandon every measure he is taking in pursuance of the message, as the Governor is making firm war preparations against him; whereupon the King ceased and withdrew any plans he might have formed to seize the Adansis suddenly, which now Mr. —— in his shame glories and boasts of, that ""the King of Ashanti has done what he has all along predicted that he would do."" I am astonished at his scandalous pretences to be a prophet. The real cause why the King withdrew his intentions so abruptly was this last message which Mr. —— sent him by Appiah, which reached him before he heard from his messengers whom he sent with the gold axe, and the message of his coming down on the Governor\'s refusal to deliver up Owoosoo, to chastise the Assins, what the mission has imminently caused. The King, of course, on receiving the message per Appiah, became convinced that the message of November was delusive, and inferred from a case which happened in the year 1853, in which two Assin chiefs, named Chiboo and Jaipee, deceived the late King Quacoo Duoh, and similarly received several hundred ounces of gold dust from King Quacoo Duah in order that the King might send to take the Assins and Dencherahs, which resulted in the invasion, commanded by Assamoa Guantah. Mr. ——\'s statement, that 6,000 men were coming for the funeral customs, was a pretext which he intended merely to blindfold us that the enemy, if they truly mean to harm us, may gain time to overwhelm us; and it was but for the speedy measures taken by the Government that the Adansis and Assins are now once more saved. Time does not permit me to finish, but (D.V.) I shall write you more by the next. Trusting you will do me the favour of giving me a space in your next.—I am yours faithfully,  \n**G. M.

Prince Ossoo Ansah is the only one of the six who can speak English, and is appointed to act as interpreter and spokesman.

It seems that the relations of Great Britain towards Ashanti have, with the sanction of the French Government, assumed somewhat new features, as it has been recognised as falling within the British sphere of influence. With the increased assurance of protection thus afforded, British traders have extended their operations in the country, which is extremely fertile in general produce, and especially rich in gold.

Then there is the difficulty the  \nKing has placed in the appointment of a British Resident at  \nCoomassie. Our relations with the Ashantees have almost at all  \ntimes been of an unpleasant character. A warlike and barbarous  \npeople, their policy has invariably been an aggressive one,  \nand the tribes within the British Protectorate seem to be  \nthe victims of their lust for war and spoliation.

Upon this the Ashantees invaded Fanti territory and were  \nagain victorious. It is alleged that the then Governor-in-Chief  \nof the Gold Coast made formal acknowledgment that ""by right  \nof conquest, Fanti, including Cape Coast and every other town  \nin the neighbourhood, belonged exclusively to the Empire of  \nAshanti, with the reservation of a judicial authority by the  \nCompany over such towns as stood in the vicinity of the castles.""\n\nIn 1821 Parliament abolished the African Company and  \ntransferred its forts and possessions to the Crown.

The personal aspect of the matter is to us of little significance; and, probably, it is so to Dr. Horton himself, of whose personal merits the letter is not an unimportant record. Its chief value consists in unfolding of the laws and institutions of the powerful Negro kingdom, a feature which shows that the power of that kingdom is not based entirely upon a blind reverence for bodily strength and martial prowess. The Ashantees acknowledge the advantage of encouraging every virtue, the direction of which is to advance the interest of the country, by enlisting amongst the nobility any person who distinguishes himself in the patriotic display of every such virtue. It is no wonder that their warriors fight to death, with true Spartan bravery, when they know that the meanest subject may, by valour—which now furnishes the chief means for patriotic advancement of the interests of the kingdom—create for himself a position equal to that of the best born of the land. This system of ennobling the meritorious as a reward for public services, prevails somewhat amongst the Dahomans. It is a mistake, therefore, to suppose that it is the fear of death alone, from an enraged monarch, that moves either the Ashantee or Dahoman soldier to court death by brave deeds in war, rather than return home under an ignominious sense of defeat to meet a more ignominious death. Skertchly, in his book on Dahomey, states that he was made a peer of the realm by Gelele for his services in teaching the native soldiery the use of certain guns.

Meantime, we repose the utmost confidence in the British General, officers, and soldiers; and we cherish the hope that we are about to emerge at an early date, and on good terms, from the conflict."" The address from which this extract is taken, is one of great power and intense interest, shadowing forth, as it does, changes of extreme importance to the whole British community, and which must influence materially the future destinies of the country. Nor have we any fault to find with the above observations relative to the Ashanti War, except in the paragraphs as to ""the establishment of friendship with the Ashantees,"" and ""the duty of avoiding in future the first entrance into equivocal and entangling engagements."" The latter is a fine phrase, meaning nothing, and copied out of Mr. Bright\'s textbook—a bad volume for a Minister to study as regards foreign relations. Should equivocal and entangling engagements appear to be necessary in the future, for forwarding some great object of Imperial policy, they will be entered into then as they have been entered into in the past. One unacquainted with the history of our connection with the Gold Coast countries, would imagine that, by some act of official stupidity, we had recently entered into engagements which had led to this Ashanti War. Nothing can be farther from the truth. Our engagements with the Gold Coast at this time—those engagements which have forced us into the present Ashanti War—are the unavoidable legacy of the foreign slave trade we ruthlessly carried on there for more than a century, and the efforts since made by the conscience-stricken British nation to put a final end to that abominable traffic. We were thus naturally led to, and detained on, the Gold Coast. We could not remain there without being supreme, and asserting and exercising our supremacy. In the exercise of this supremacy, we became naturally the protectors of the Gold Coast against enemies by sea or land. We consequently took upon ourselves the direction of its external relations, among the chief of which were those with Ashanti; and if there is now a war between us and Ashanti, that war is not the result of Fantee action, nor of ""our having entered into equivocal engagements,"" but of a culpable neglect and mismanagement on our part, the responsibility for which does not attach to the present Administration alone, but to many successive Administrations, which have chosen to shut their eyes to, and take no efficient measures to prevent, results which every unofficial person connected with those countries could foresee. Then, as regards friendship with Ashanti, as a result of the present advance on Kumasi. Should the Ashanti power survive the victory which we are bound to obtain over it at whatever cost, there could not be any friendship between it and us, except by a total change in its principles, customs, and character. Kumasi is a charnel-house, a slaughter-pen, where the blood of innocent human victims is incessantly flowing. Hitherto we have not been responsible for this, save that by a national effort, such as Ashanti has now forced upon us, we might have put an end to it. But if we entered into relations with it (after having conquered it) that would re-establish and perpetuate it, we should be responsible, and guilty as a nation, before God and man. Friendship between light and darkness is not less impossible than friendship, under such circumstances, between Christian Britain and the Ashanti which has been known of up to this present time. But our own opinion, expressed at the commencement of the present operations, and which we still retain, is that there will not be any danger of our falling into such a snare of guilty complicity with a murderous superstition, because the Ashanti power, losing all its prestige by our successful advance on Kumasi, will fall in pieces. It has only existed hitherto through the mutual jealousies of divers people, whom it has played one against another, while using them all for its aggressive operations. We may be mistaken; but this, we repeat, is our confirmed opinion; and it will be well for the Administration of which Mr. Gladstone is the head that this contingency should be maturely considered, in order that they may be able to deal in the most advantageous manner with the emergency should it arise.', 'last_edit_date': '1874-01-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_01_1874#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE END AND PURPOSE OF THE ASHANTI WAR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Peace, to large and populous countries of the interior of Africa. We cannot conceive any reason why those countries should not contain some of those to-be blessed people, of whom we have thus made mention; and if they do so contain them, and these are to be reached only by the prostration and destruction of that most awfully blood-stained kingdom, this war will be made an instrument for opening the way to those who will willingly set forth with the glad tidings. Again, if they do so contain them, and they are only thus to be reached, the honour which God thus offers to our beloved country is in our eyes so great, as to outweigh a hundredfold any temporary pecuniary outlay, or any sacrifices far more painful, that the procuring of it may involve. And while we look at the progress of events during the last fifty years of our relations with the Gold Coast countries, we cannot avoid the conviction that there has been a gradual Divine preparation for Great Britain, of this honour which she has sought to repudiate and to avoid, even to the very verge of national dishonour. We believe that, however nations, and especially so-called Christian nations, may desire to live and act for their own ends, interests, and purposes alone, an overruling Divine Governor shapes that selfish life and purposes to the accomplishment of His own great supreme designs as regards the children of men. In the pursuit of that abominable object—the carrying on of a foreign slave trade, a cruel dealing in human flesh for gain—several European nations, and among them Great Britain, obtained sea-side settlements on the Gold Coast. We need not enter here upon any detail of the causes and events which led to the final extinction of that sinful trade there carried on. Suffice it to say, that by conquest and purchase, Great Britain became, with the Dutch, the only possessors of sea-coast dominions there; and that, finally, so late as 1872, the Dutch, compelled by native African pressure—which Great Britain not only did not aid or assist, but condemned and opposed—were glad to abandon all the posts they occupied, upon the mere payment to them by Great Britain of the money value of the stores they left behind them. A few words will suffice to show how important a difference was thus made in the position and responsibilities of Great Britain as regards the Protected Territories and Ashanti. The Ashantees are the hereditary and deadly enemies of the people of the Protectorate, whom they have long regarded as their rightful prey, and have sought to annihilate, that they might themselves enter into undisputed possession of these countries, and their coveted sea-coast. While the Dutch were joint possessors with the English of the sea-board of the Gold Coast, the latter were greatly restricted in their action. The Dutch were always friends and allies of the Ashantees. They had still a little slave trade of their own under another name, the victims of which were brought down from Ashanti. Whenever the Ashantees made an invasion of the Protected Territories, they received ammunition and arms, and all necessary supplies, through the Dutch towns. By the retirement of the Dutch last year, this was all changed, and we were brought face to face with Ashanti. In the furtherance of a most short-sighted and selfish policy, the British Government had of late years openly proclaimed that the people of the so-called Protectorate must in future depend upon themselves alone for their defence against their deadly enemy. This, too, while they still retained solely in their own hands the conduct of all relations with that enemy, which became thus British relations, and not theirs; while, too, they exacted obedience to all behests, so far as they chose, throughout the entire Protectorate; levied, collected, and retained for their own use the entire import duties, amounting, in 1872, to above 50,000l.; and not only refused to allow, but put down an effort at native union for defence against the Ashantees, for making roads and educating the people; and this, as it seemed to us, chiefly because it would necessarily involve their apportioning to the Fanti Confederation a share of the revenues they levied, and the formation of a native organized military force, not immediately under the command of the British Administrator. The Ashantees saw and knew of all this; they could not fail to do so, because the British administrative voice was continuously loud that all the people of the Protectorate could expect from them in any future invasion was a small supply of arms and ammunition. Was not this an encouragement by Great Britain to the Ashantees to invade the territories which she thus declared she would neither herself protect, nor allow the natives to organize efficiently to protect? It was such an encouragement, and was followed by just such results as might have been anticipated. We knew, of course, that, in the event of a formidable invasion, the British Government would be forced to take the field, sooner or later, against the aggressors, though the Ashantees believed that they would not; being encouraged therein by the British authorities treating for the ransom of the German missionaries whom they had kidnapped within the bounds of the Protectorate. And the British local authorities seem to have been of the same opinion; having, if we may judge by the course pursued, adopted Sir Charles Adderley's principles and ideas, that the British Government occupied their positions on the Gold Coast merely for purposes of trade; that it was quite indifferent to them whether the trade was with Fantees or Ashantees, and consequently that there was no reason why the Ashantees should not be allowed to annihilate the natives, and occupy their territories, provided always they respected those British positions, and would pay the Customs' duties levied there. The Ashanti monarch therefore sent the vanguard of his army across the River Prah early in December, 1872. They commenced by destroying the villages in their route. The King of Akim dispatched messengers in hot haste to Colonel Harley at Cape Coast, informing him of what had happened, of the imminent danger, and requesting a supply of arms and ammunition, that he might attack the invaders. Colonel Harley, however, was too fully imbued with Sir Charles Adderley's principles and ideas, to view these things in the same light as they appeared to the King of Akim. Instead of sending the prayed-for supplies, he ordered the King of Akim to abstain from all hostilities, unless he chose to incur the heavy displeasure of Her Majesty's Government. The result was what might have been expected. Encouraged by the absence of all opposition, fortified by Colonel Harley's pacific dispositions, in their belief that the Fantees were to be entirely given up to their tender mercies, the Ashantees flooded in. Time came, when their large army was within thirty or forty miles of Cape Coast (having destroyed some fifty or sixty villages), that Colonel Harley could not regard them any longer as ardent traders, coming down to fill the colonial chest with Customs' duties; but, still true to the Adderley principles and ideas, in sending up a couple of officers with some Houssas to inspect and report, he is understood to have ordered that under no circumstances should they fire a shot against the invaders. The Fantees had then advanced a large force against them. Those officers, with the Houssas, saw the Fantees overpowered in fight by them, yet abstained from giving any aid. Is it a matter of surprise that the Ashantees should at last have believed that not only had the British abandoned the Fantees to them, but that, with a little pressure, they would give up Elmina and Cape Coast Castle also, and leave the Gold Coast to their sole possession? We are merely showing how this Ashanti War has come about; that Great Britain has brought it entirely on herself, through the prevalence of dishonouring administrative principles and ideas, and the dignified incompetence of her local executive head; that she is forced into it against her will, through neglect of sacred and obvious duties; and that, as thus now acting in opposition to her own wishes and desires, she is—if she will now perform her duty adequately, persistently, and inflexibly—an instrument in the hands of an overruling Providence for working out a great intent. Ashanti has been a standing Satanic outrage against God and man. Her soil—and especially that of her capital town, Kumassie—is saturated with human gore—the incessant blood tribute relentlessly poured forth at the behests of a beastly superstition. Great Britain, though full of contempt and disdain for such a feeble and savage enemy—totally wanting in adequate military organization and armament to oppose her, and only difficult to conquer because the country to be traversed is without roads, furnishes none of the means of subsistence, and has a deleterious climate—has been compelled to enter the lists against her. Forced thus into action, let her beware how..."", 'last_edit_date': '1873-11-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_11_1873#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Journey to Kumasi, the Capital of Ashanti.

On Tuesday I therefore prepared to start, and, while so doing, was told that on account of the rains that had been pouring during the night, Ashantees on their way to Kumasi had had to return, because the rivers could not be crossed. I was told it was impossible to travel that day, and, not being able to help myself, said we must wait till the morrow. On Wednesday morning we left Bogyawai at six o'clock. We had travelled six hours when we again met two messengers from the King. He still said that we must remain at Bogyawai until Thursday week. I answered that this was impossible, that I should travel as far as Kasi, a village half an hour's walk from Kumasi, and that they must return to tell the King of it. I again urged that if the King detained me too long, I should be obliged to remain in Kumasi the whole of the rainy season, which I was determined not to do. The next day they brought me a message somewhat more satisfactory. I had permission to enter Kumasi on Monday. I had, therefore, to wait only three days at Kasi. Sunday evening, just as I was preparing for evening service, a woman was brought to me in tears and in great distress. She said she had come from Amoaful, for me to save her sister. The King had that day sent messengers to the chief, telling him that her sister, who was of the family of the King of Juabin, must be first sacrificed at the commencement of a custom just about to be kept for the slain chiefs during the war. She was already in log, and if I did not interfere she would soon be killed. The poor woman entreated so much, saying that she had a few days before seen her aged mother sacrificed, that I felt greatly moved. I sent for the King's two messengers who were with me, and told them I wished one of them to go to the King at once, and ask him for my sake to spare that woman. The King acceded to my request, a messenger was sent after the woman, and in three days she was brought to me in Kumasi. Her two children, one three years of age and the second a babe at the breast, had been taken from her, and she was very uneasy about them. After much difficulty I had them brought and restored to the mother the very day I left Kumasi. On Monday, April 10th, at nine A.M. we started for Kumasi. We were conducted into a new path recently cut through the bush, but by which I was told all Europeans had to enter Kumasi. This path brought us to the end of a long and wide street leading to the palace. Here we sat till we received intelligence from the King as to our future movements. After waiting half an hour, a messenger came to say that the King wished me to go to our lodgings, and take breakfast before the reception. I lodged in Prince Ansah's hut, which is quite near to the Mission grounds. Soon after our arrival some Elmina men, who had been some months trading in Kumasi, came to pay me their respects. They gave me a most horrible account of human sacrifices during the preceding week. There had been some every day, and the number on Saturday, when the King went to Bantama, was twenty-six! Sixteen were killed at Bantama, and when the King returned to town ten were killed in the market place. At three P.M. I was told the King was ready to give me a reception. Stepping out of doors, I was half-startled, but much amused, by being confronted by a foolish-looking fellow with a peacock's tail outspread on the top of his head, and covered with gold plates and ornaments from head to toe. In his hand was a gold-handled sword, which indicated that he was to be my guide. We followed him in single file, all my carriers walking before me. We were conducted through the market-place, then down another street, leading past the Stone Palace, now in ruins, then, turning to the left, went up another street, at the top of which is a large open space, where sat the King, his chiefs, with their captains, and numerous armed attendants; also the Queen-mother and a large company of women. They were all seated in a half circular line, each chief being under a large umbrella. I walked along the whole line, being introduced and shaking hands with all the chiefs and captains, more than one hundred in number. The King was seated about ten yards in the rear of the middle of the line, with a large number of attendants on either side of him. To him I simply raised my hat, while his attendants shouted his honours, even calling him the Possessor of Heaven and Earth. Having paid him my respects, I was conducted to another place, where I had to sit and receive theirs. They came in procession. Each of the chiefs was preceded by beating of drums and followed by armed men. They were carried in baskets on men's shoulders to within a few yards from me, when they alighted, and walked past me, each shaking hands. The scene became somewhat altered when the King approached. The tumbling and dancing and shuffling and shouting of those who went before him was almost bewildering, and rendered it almost impossible for me to keep my seat, and, fearing to be knocked over, I stood. It became more pleasant as these passed on, and the King's musical bands approached, followed by men carrying golden and silver bells, golden smoking pipes, and other jewels. Then came the King on foot, and surrounded by some fifty attendants. He wore a golden crown on his head, his body and arms were covered with gold ornaments, on each of his fingers were one or two massive gold rings, his sandals were richly decorated with gold, and round his waist was a most magnificent silk cloth. As he drew near he commenced dancing in a most wild and awkward manner,—men taking hold of his legs and holding his body, as if unable by himself to stand,—flung his arms about most curiously, and distorted the features of his countenance by making the most horrid grimaces. Just for one moment he smiled and waved his hand, then taking his sceptre from an attendant, signalled for the procession to move on. When the Queen-mother passed, I took hold of her hand to shake hands; two or three women caught them, and held them. I afterwards asked what this meant, and I was told it was to prevent my fetishes doing her any harm. It was seven o'clock when the reception was over, and I returned to my quarters."", 'last_edit_date': '1876-05-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1876#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ASHANTI WAR OPERATIONS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'explicit and urgent directions for the protection of health.

The order speaks encouragingly of the climate of the interior, and assures the men that the operations beyond the Prah will last only a few weeks. It concludes as follows: ""When once a position has been gained, it is to be held resolutely. In warfare of this nature, there must be no retreats. No village or camp is to be set on fire except by order of the major-general commanding; officers and men are reminded of the danger and delay which occur if a village is set on fire before all the ammunition and baggage have made their way through it. All plundering and unnecessary destruction of property are to be strictly repressed; officers are to be strictly responsible that, when a village or camp is occupied, their men are kept together, and prevented from dispersing to seek plunder. The importance of kindness from all ranks to the friendly natives, who are employed as carriers, is strongly urged: if the carriers are ill-treated, the troops run imminent risk of being left without food and ammunition. It must never be forgotten by the soldiers that Providence has implanted in the heart of every native of Africa a superstitious awe and dread of the white man, that prevents the negro from daring to meet him face to face in combat. A steady advance or a charge, no matter how partial, if made with determination, always means the retreat of the enemy. Although, when at a distance, and even when under a heavy fire, the Ashantees seem brave enough, from their practice of yelling and singing and beating drums in order to frighten the enemies of their own colour with whom they are accustomed to make war, they will not stand against the advance of the white man. English soldiers and sailors are accustomed to fight against immense odds in all parts of the world. It is scarcely necessary to remind them that when in our battles beyond the Prah they find themselves surrounded on all sides by hordes of howling enemies, they must rely upon their old British courage and discipline, and upon the courage of their comrades. Soldiers and sailors, remember that the black man holds you in superstitious awe.

Few responded, although a group did organize the African Development Society in 1899, the chief objective of which was to encourage Afro-Americans to buy land and settle in East Central Africa. The Society would sell shares or land rights offered by African petitioners but only to Afro-American or African purchasers. 4 Bishop Turner also later served as an adviser to the International Migration Society (IMS) of Alabama, which sent about 500 emigrants to Africa before it became defunct in 1900. Some of the 500 remained in Liberia; others returned to the United States. Those who remained fared reasonably well; evidently more than a few of them prospered. On the other hand, those who returned told horror stories of poor land, inadequate food and poor living conditions. These stories reduced the likelihood of any large-scale Afro-American emigration movement, even though prospects for blacks in the United States were declining from 1895 to 1900. Nevertheless, numerous Afro-Americans evidently continued to give serious consider› ation to African emigration, just as others in the United States and the Caribbean simply moved away from overt discriminatory practices into other regions near by.\nAfter the turn of the twentieth century, the back-to-Africa baton was picked up by others. For example, one Captain Dean, early in the twentieth century, hoped to engineer the settlement of American blacks in South Africa to fashion a powerful black state there. After the briefest sojourn meant to arrange for this settlement, however, white authorities expelled Dean from the Cape for what were termed 'provocative activities'. And in 1914, Chief Alfred C. Sam, a Gold Coast African, turned up in Oklahoma, persuaded about sixty black farmers that Africa offered them greater oppor› tunities and sailed with them to Saltpond in the Gold Coast. Finding Chief Sam's claims to be exaggerated and encountering restrictions from the Gold Coast officials which inhibited the entry of American immigrants, most of the Oklahomans eventually returned to the United States. But no one made so deep an impression as an advocate of emigration on Africans and American blacks alike as did Marcus Garvey who was born in Jamaica in 1887."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Economic and social change in Liberia and Ethiopia, 1915-35 > Ethiopia', 'content': 'the medical field, mainly by missionaries, notably the United Presbyterian Church of North America, the Seventh Adventist Mission, and the Italian Catholic Mission, all of which operated hospitals in Addis Ababa, while the Sudan Interior Mission ran a leprosarium at Akaki.$^{75}$ Other developments included the creation of a small civil service, partly formed with students returning from abroad, which received salaries instead of the revenues from fiefs, and the increasing replacement of tribute in kind by taxes in cash.

However, this change did not amount to much and both countries therefore remained economically backward and socially undevel› oped.

Repatri› ation during the nineteenth century offered few material rewards for Europeans or non-Europeans. But by 1900, the divergence between Africa and the Americas had become too great. Persons of African descent became caught up in the self-consciousness of the age which produced the type of xenophobic nationalism that all but destroyed the appeal of Africa. More› over, the interest in Africa after the end of the slave trade grew from national lusts for power and wealth - and Afro-Americans lacked both political power and the wealth needed to stimulate their own interest, or influence those who were partitioning Africa into colonial spheres. The Afro-American view became focused more on the new developments within their hemisphere. Internal and inter-regional migrations and the quest to establish the good life against new deleterious challenges absorbed their attention. The African connection faded, but did not die. The return-toAfrica movement found individual promoters who could occasionally infuse the movement with new appeal. In 1897, Henry Sylvester Williams, a Trinidadian-born lawyer living in London, founded the Pan-African Association, whose later membership would include George Padmore, Kwame Nkrumah and C. L. R. James. In the 1920s Marcus Garvey founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association, a movement designed to spur African decolonization and unite all Africans wherever they were found. Garvey's organization had branches in Canada, the USA, the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa.$^{57}$ By the time that Garvey's organization collapsed in 1927, Africa, and especially the Ethiopian question, had already begun to assume paramount importance in world affairs."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.621, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': 'The outcome of the Scramble and partition for Liberia and Ethiopia', 'content': ""One of the main reasons for the survival of both Liberia and Ethiopia was the very strong belief of the peoples of both countries that they were destined by the Almighty God to survive, a belief which very much strengthened their determination to resist all European encroachments and aggression. Growing largely out of the experience of involuntary servitude in the New World, there was imbedded within the Liberian consciousness a firm faith in a Divine Being as controller of the destiny of the Nation. Several Liberian presidents were ministers of the gospel. Indeed, Liberians have always viewed each major event in their history as the result of divine intervention. It is this same belief that underlies the much-quoted expres› sion of Emperor Menelik of Ethiopia in 1893 that 'Ethiopia has need of no one; she stretches out her hands unto God', as well as the passage from his letter to Queen Victoria in August 1891 and his proclamation of September 1895 on the eve of the battle of Adowa quoted in the first chapter of this volume.$^{78}$ There is no doubt that this firm belief on the part of the peoples of these countries filled them with a determination that should go some way to explaining their successful opposition to all the European onslaughts.\nThe second main reason for the survival of Ethiopia and Liberia was diplomatic. On the one hand, both were able to play one European power against the other and were able to resist by diplomacy the more indirect pressures of the colonial powers. Menelik certainly succeeded in playing Italy, France and Britain off against each other. Having relied on French arms to defend himself against the Italians in 1896, he made use of the British in 1902 when the French attempted to obtain excessive control over the Djibuti railway. Menelik's objective, de Castro states, was simply to make use of the technological achievements of Europe without succumb› ing to it politically. 'If Europeans came into our house to bring us civiliza› tion', the Emperor is said to have reasoned, 'we thank them very much, but they must bring it without us losing our sovereignty. We know how to profit from whatever aspects of their civilization are most helpful to us'.$^{79}$ Liberia also constantly played off France against Britain, and Britain against Germany, while she did not hesitate, whenever the going was tough, to bring in the United States to make the necessary threatening noises to ward off any of these powers."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.596, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The expression of African nationalism and politics', 'content': ""Social organizations which contributed to the expression of African nationalism and anti-colonial politics included the several branches in Africa of Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association which had been founded in America in 1917.

They claimed that it was often the result of 'superstition' and that peoples otherwise content to accept colonial rule had been worked upon by 'witch-doctors'. Many European critics of colonialism, sympathetic to African protest, nevertheless also accepted that Africans had little in their 'traditional' patterns of thought which helped them to come to an effective or practical response to attacks on their way of life. The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ...

For mainly economic reasons, Germany, France and Britain were not prepared to see any one of them in sole control of Liberia since the traders of each of these countries were active there. For sentimental reasons, the United States was bent on ensuring the survival of Liberia. Thus, from October 1862 when a formal Treaty of Commerce and Navigation was signed and ratified by the United States Congress, United States military gunboats continued to appear periodically in Liberian waters to put an end to the resistance of the indigenous peoples to Liberian rule and at the same time to moderate French and British ambitions to carve up Liberia on the pretext that Liberia was unable to police her borders.$^{80}$ At other times, the United States employed diplomatic means to warn Britain and France of the moral judgement of history should either of them make any attempt to end the independence of Liberia. Thus in 1879 and 1898, the United States warned France and Germany not to annex or establish a protectorate over Liberia.$^{8}$ ' In the same way, for mainly strategic reasons, Britain, France and Italy were not prepared to see any one of them in sole control of Ethiopia. It is significant that when in 1906 the imperial powers of Britain, France and Italy felt that Menelik's failing health would be followed by the dis› integration of his empire, all three of them came together to secretly sign a tripartite Convention in which Ethiopia was divided among them, a move which was exposed by Menelik even before his death. 82 However, in the case of Ethiopia, there is one unique and crucial factor that should be cited in explanation of her survival, and which also explains the fact that she was able to extend her territorial limits during the period under review, and that is her military strength. Had Menelik lost the battle of Adowa, Ethiopia would undoubtedly have become an Italian colony in 1896. But as shown above, thanks to her military strength which was far superior to that of Italy in Africa, Ethiopia won that battle and thereby maintained her independence.

It seems, therefore, that although the UNIA depu› tation failed to establish organizational links with the Horn of Africa as with Liberia, it did succeed in orienting a number of prospective American black emigrants towards service there.

Cre› ativity became especially necessary where a small number of Europeans lived among a large number of Africans as was the case in many colonies of exploitation such as Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Saint-Domingue. Where the European population failed to comprise a critical mass, the Africans had to build a society from a diverse collectivity of individuals who had little more in common than their skin colour and their servility. The adoption of their customs and behaviour by the non-African sector indicated the measure of their success.\nAfricans did not always conform to the society into which they were thrust. For centuries marronage, or the flight from the slave system, existed as an integral aspect of slavery.$^{53}$ In Brazil, the north-east witnessed the establishment of the quilombo of Palmares which lasted almost a century and which was eliminated only with the largest military force ever mounted in the Americas by the Portuguese and Brazilians. Maroon towns existed for equally long periods in Esmeraldas in Ecuador and in parts of the Blue Mountains and the Cockpit Country of Jamaica. Marronage manifested not only the wish to be free, it was an eloquent and visible condemnation of the system of slavery by Africans.\nBy the time African slavery was eliminated in the Americas, the position of the African sector had worsened dramatically from what it had been a century before. The political and economic reconstruction that followed the Civil War in the USA accompanied a movement of legal discrimination and social and economic exclusion of the non-white sector, characterized by segregated institutions, lynchings, and overtly racist societies and organ› izations, which combined until the middle of the twentieth century.$^{54}$ The general conditions experienced by black Americans then compared with those prevailing today in a more extreme way in South Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.6, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: North Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The economy of North Africa in the first quarter of the twentieth century did not develop at the same pace or pass through the same stages in all constituent countries (Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Libya, Egypt and Sudan), because they were not colonized at the same time (see Fig. 17. i).', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.597, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Central Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'The struggle to maintain independence: the era of confrontation and alliance', 'content': 'African rivalries, moreover, facilitated a strategy of divide and rule which Harry Johnston and other colonial officials employed with consum› mate skill. The annals of the struggle for the retention of the African\'s independence and sovereignty are replete with examples of Africans who not only, submitted but aided the colonial powers in"" an effort to avenge past abuses perpetrated by their neighbours. The Inhambane Tonga and the Sena helped the Portuguese against their respective Shangaan and Barue overlords, while in the Congo a number of subject people co-operated with the Belgians to free themselves from Yeke and Arab rule or from the slave raiders. In addition, several African leaders recognized that alliances with the Europeans could fulfil their expansionist aspirations and simultaneously strengthen their own internal position. Such considera› tions, for example, motivated Tippu Tib and the sons of Msiri to aid the Congo Free State.$^{28}$ Other African societies, including some which initially opposed the invaders, later allied$^{29}$ with them in exchange for material benefits and promises of improved status in the new colonial order. Thus, once the Yao were defeated, they helped to conquer the Mpeseni Nguni who, in turn, were used by the Portuguese to defeat the Barue. , ·;/-.,-, Without African allies and mercenaries, it would not have been possible for the Europeans to impose their rule at such a minimal cost in man› power. More than 90% of.the Portuguese armies which finally \'conquered\' the Zambezi valley in 1902, for example, were African levies.$^{30}$ Although not as extreme, a similar pattern existed in Angola. To the north, the Congo Free State army consisted of African levies with some Zanzibari and Hausa mercenaries. Only, the officers were Europeans.

Few societies that effect any permanent good are grand in their beginnings. Precociousness in them, as in children, is fatal to real power. Fiction alone starts into complete existence; while the realities of life build up gradually the individual and general structures of human history. Error is glittering; nothing is easier than to dazzle and win with it. Truth is the reverse of this; and struggles amid difficulty and hardship into appreciation and favour. Look at our great missionary societies. Consult their early records. The Church Missionary Society was at first very coldly received. During some years its income fluctuated from three or four hundred to a thousand pounds a-year. People who could not, or did not, care to see, or were unable to grasp the great principle of its existence, sneered at it, no doubt. It was doing nothing, of course. No one could perceive any rich fruit of its exertions; and yet it had sown and gathered something in from the first seed—and yet it was from the first moment gradually advancing toward the great harvest of its present utility—and yet it had securely laid the foundation of its present goodly edifice. The germ of its actual vigorous life was swelling amid the cerements of the national apathy, anon to throw out its roots, to raise high its head and spread wide its branches; to fatten and flourish in the rich soil and sunshine of popular wealth and favour, and cast around the precious leaves of Christian truth appointed for the healing of the nations.\n\nIt would justly be thought presumptuous in us to liken the African-Aid Society, now struggling through the diseases and feebleness of infancy, with that veteran society whose efforts have been crowned with much success. But there is no presumption in comparing the actual infancy of the one with the remote infancy of the other. All societies of slow development are subject to the same early maladies. The future alone can determine whether the African-Aid Society will pass safely through those to which it, in common with others, has been subject. But we fearlessly maintain that if actual service performed entitles to success, the African-Aid Society has established its claim.\n\nWhat was and is its self-imposed mission? To grapple with the material evils that oppress and degrade Africa, and its people—to hasten the annihilation of the atrocious slave-trade, which drains the African continent of its life's blood—and to aid and stimulate the development of the industrial resources which God has there so lavished.""}, {'id': 277, 'article_title': '1863 AND 1864, AND THE AFRICAN-AID SOCIETY.', 'full_section_title': '1863 AND 1864, AND THE AFRICAN-AID SOCIETY.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1863#article-14', 'issue_date': '23_12_1863', 'content': ""In this the last number of the African-Aid Society's journal for the year 1863, dated almost on the eve of the feast of the Nativity, we tender our heartfelt greetings to our friends and readers, wishing them, in the name of Him whose advent we commemorate, health, joy, and perfect peace.

When Mr. Fitzgerald, the Managing Honorary Secretary, left England for a visit to the Continent at the end of March last (previous to which he had assumed the proprietorship of the *African Times*, as the only means of securing its continued existence), the Society had about 200l. in hand, and its only debt was 30l., for rent to fall due May 11th. The society was not therefore compelled to close for want of funds, as the expenses, including rent, were only 130l. a-year. The dissolution was brought about by parties who, including the Chairman, only contributed 4l. a-year to its funds, if we except Sir John Boileau, a subscriber of 5l. per annum, a gentleman for whom we entertain the highest respect, and who, on the resignation of the Chairman at the second meeting, and no successor being found, was induced to second the motion for that purpose. Mr. Banner, who in the early days of the Society had given a donation of 10l., but who had for some years been a declared enemy of the Society; Ex-Governor Pine (Cape Coast), who felt deeply aggrieved by the *African Times*, and other enemies and lukewarm friends, took part in the business. As we presume that a general meeting, so called, possessed legitimate power to close the Society, we can only deplore the result. But we can, and do, object to two things—viz., the payment for Mr. McLeod, out of the funds, of 20l. owing by him to Mr. Banner, and the grant of 50l. also to Mr. McLeod for his able assistance in destroying the Society. For this, and for this only, the said 50l. was given, the *testimonial* being only an after-thought, Mr. McLeod having been formerly paid for any special services rendered by him, and not having had any part in the management for some years past.\n\nThe protest of Mr. Fitzgerald being alluded to in the advertisement, we append it. Mr. Fitzgerald arrived in time to attend the last meeting, but declined to take any part in proceedings, of which he entirely disapproved, a course in which he was joined by Mr. Gladstone, a subscriber of 20l. per annum, Mr. Fitzgerald's only act being to offer 12l. for the furniture, after it was stated that 11l. was the most any broker would give. But the broker's 11l. was preferred to Mr. Fitzgerald's 12l., as appears by the accounts; and this was the only *recognition* of Mr. F.'s services.""}]","[{'document_title': 'ADDRESS BY THE EDITOR TO SUBSCRIBERS AND FRIENDS OF THE ""AFRICAN TIMES.""', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A combined and powerful attack has been lately made upon the African Times, to destroy its existence, if possible, and deprive the educated African people and their less advanced countrymen of that power of appeal to the public opinion of Great Britain which they now possess through its columns.

We had the happiness of knowing and of loving him; we therefore mourn our loss in his departure, while rejoicing at his great gain.\n\nThe late Mr. Ferguson represented the ancient city of Carlisle in Parliament during the years 1852 to 1857. Lamenting the great prevalence of intoxication among the operatives of Carlisle on Sundays, he zealously endeavoured, while building and endowing schools and places of worship for the people, to obtain the closing of all public-houses on that day. This incited the public-house interest against him, and he was not re-elected. Such a defeat was glorious, not humiliating. He was munificent in his gifts for purposes of which his heart and conscience approved. From early life he devoted one-tenth of his income to works of Christian usefulness and progress; at a later period he increased this to one-fifth part. But even then he drew no rigid line, and often passed that limit when he found there was some great and pressing need.\n\nMr. Ferguson was the first donor to, as well as one of the most liberal after supporters of, the African-Aid Society. He may, therefore, be said to have laid its pecuniary foundation-stone. The difficulties attending its early progress did not discourage him—his hand was ever open for it—and in one of the last conversations we had with him, a short time before he quitted his sphere of earthly usefulness, he expressed his strong conviction that it would prove to be one of the great instruments in God’s hands for the world’s good, and soon win its way to a far greater measure of public support than it has hitherto received. We who know its great aim in promoting the industrial regeneration of a Continent hitherto almost torpid in everything but what is evil, hope and believe that the spirit of prophecy, as well as of zeal, was at that moment resting upon the aged, single-hearted, ardent, humble-minded Christian, who did all “to the glory of God.”\n\nThe late Mr. Ferguson was interred at Carlisle on Thursday, the 26th ult. The shops of the ancient city were nearly all closed, the Corporation attended in state, and the Lord Bishop of Carlisle conducted the funeral service at the tomb of his departed friend.

His views for the industrial regeneration of a portion of the world we have so assisted in debasing by the slave-trade to our colonies and elsewhere were large and noble; and believing that in Africa alone the children of Africa could attain to real equality with other free people, his anxiety to forward the emigration of free coloured persons from America to Africa was very great.\n\nSir Culling Eardley was eminently a worker in the great fields of religion and humanity. He really gave himself no adequate rest; day and night he was engaged in his noble and useful labours; and it is believed that this self-devotion led to a premature exhaustion of his physical powers, and thus exposed him to the attack of that disease which removed him from among us.\n\nSir Culling Eardley had already made preliminary arrangements for a great African meeting at Bedwell-park, in the ensuing autumn, by which it was expected that the funds of the African-Aid Society would have largely benefited.

One man got up and said he would give two guineas; another, who had given me seven guineas before, gave 20l; another, who before, had given 6l. 6s., gave twenty-three guineas. This sent some of the people almost off their heads; but when the uproar had ceased promises came thick and fast.

European abolitionists found, for example, that to stop the slave trade and the wars in the interior, they had to reckon not just with the coastal rulers but also with the different power bases in the interior. Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome. Similarly, British peace› makers involved in resolving aspects of nineteenth-century Yoruba warfare had to travel virtually throughout the length and breadth of the culture area.\nUnfortunately, the European approach was divisive, tending towards politically structured differentiation. This was already noticeable in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era. British interests came to be specifically protected visà-vis the interest of other European nationals; British interests were also advanced against those of Africans. We have already drawn attention to the penetration of the Benin kingdom from the Niger delta and the resultant whittling down of Benin's trading hinterland to the extent of the eventual abandonment of Ughoton, Benin's traditional port. Further west, suspicion of British political intentions grew in 1851 when Lagos was bombarded by the anti-slave trade squadron."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.\nThis flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours.

Its adjustment to changing times was noticeable from the mid-century when, under the influence of a French trading firm, Victor RØgis, King Gezo (c. 1818-58) of Dahomey was persuaded to intensify the trade in palm oil, first as a supplement to the export of slaves and eventually as the dominant factor in the state's export economy.$^{41}$ The transition from slave to 'legi› timate' trade meant a corresponding increase in the need to retain war captives as labour for the maintenance and expansion of the palm oil industry. Slaves also came to be used more for transporting goods from the interior to the coast and vice-versa than as commodities for export. By the time of the French conquest of 1892-4, the foundation of Dahomey's new economy - the monoculture of palm produce - had already been laid. Developments in Dahomey mirrored those in other parts of the MonoNiger region where, as in Yorubaland, war captives who otherwise would have been sold for export overseas came to be used extensively as labour on farm plantations, or for transporting trade goods to and from the coast."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The new changes resulted from a combination of factors, including the nineteenth-century wars which, as in Yorubaland, had the effect of ren› dering the coastal areas relatively safe and attractive to migration from the hinterlands in which most of the fighting took place; the sea-borne trade which was rendered permanent by the transition from slave to 'legitimate' trade, thereby conferring a definite economic advantage on the coastal regions; and the steady growth of European interest, which enlarged the traditional role of selected coastal towns such as Lagos, Porto Novo and eventually Cotonou to take on new and increasing responsibilities not only as ports but also as political capitals of emergent colonial states and their independent African successors.\nIn all these changes, however, the economic factor would appear to have been the most dominant, especially with reference to the European presence. Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation.

Largely because of the writings of the djihad leaders and European travellers, we know enough about the complex of forces and ideas that produced the series of revolutionary movements starting from Futa Toro, Futa Jallon and Bondu in the eighteenth century and stretching to the Sokoto, Massina and Dinguiraye djihäds in the nineteenth. We therefore do not need to speculate about the possible contribution to that complex of forces and ideas of European mercantilist influence in the days of the slave trade or capitalist influence in the days of abolition and journeys of discovery. The initiative for the djihäd movements came from within. The djihäd states took a great interest in promoting agriculture, partly through traditional household production, partly also through estates worked by slave or client labour. They also promoted industrial manufacture and trade. They improved trade routes and offered protection to traders and merchants. By far the greatest portion of the traffic on the routes was for local and regional exchange. But the djihad leaders also promoted trans-Saharan trade routes and the pilgrimage route to the Eastern Sudan, the Nile Valley and Mecca.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence.

If Neapolitan sailing ships were making for the coast and caught sight of a Tunisian or Tripolitanian flag, their crews were quick to make their escape.

In some cases the dominant class emerged stronger as a result of economic and military ties to the slave-traders. Consider relations between the Bemba rulers and the Arab and Swahili traders. Under the leadership of Chileshe Chipela the Bemba had just completed a phase of territorial expansion and political centralization when the foreign traders entered their homeland around i860. As a result, the Bemba kingdom was far more unified and powerful than most states in the region. The geographical position of the Bemba, somewhat removed from the principal trade routes, precluded the growth of a large and potentially seditious merchant community within the core of their kingdom. Equally important, there was no incentive for the Arab and Swahili traders to adopt a hostile posture since the Bemba were not economic rivals. Most of the royal families' wealth came from raiding and tribute in the form of ivory and slaves and they were happy to exchange them for the cloth and other imported goods provided by the coastal merchants. This economic complementarity fostered a harmonious relationship and simultaneously enhanced the internal position of the Bemba aristocracy, which used the foreign commodities to recruit new followers and strengthen their links to subordinate chiefs. The continued demand for captives and ivory also fuelled a new expansionist phase from i860 to 1880, during which Bemba forces conquered most of contemporary north-eastern Zambia. Thus, through ties to foreign merchants, the Bemba rulers gained unprecedented regional power while accumulating a substantial amount of wealth. 43 As in the case of the Bemba, other local chiefs and merchants entered into alliances with the slave-traders that proved extremely beneficial.

When he ascended the throne in 1894, he seemed to be suspicious of Europeans, mostly missionaries at that time, so he sought to restrict his people's interactions with them. Those among the Baganda who had embraced the Christian faith and who would not obey his orders were put to death as traitors.$^{29}$ Today, Christians regard them as martyrs. Mwanga was, however, violently resisting attempts by British agents to take over his country even though disguised as mission› aries. But his diplomatic ability also became apparent in the way he handled various, often warring religious sects. At one time, he would play the two Christian sects, Catholics and Protestants, against Muslims when he thought the latter were becoming too powerful and therefore threatening his control of the country. At another time, he would ally with Muslims against Catholics or Protestants or both depending on who he thought was dangerous to his rule. Thus, Mwanga was adept at the diplomatic game of divide and rule, a tactic which the colonizing powers were able to use so effectively in controlling Africa. When it was necessary, Mwanga resorted to a revival of some old tradition in an attempt to drive out all foreigners as happened in 1888.$^{30}$ On this occasion, he intended to entice all foreigners and their Baganda followers to a naval parade on an island on Lake Victoria. There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler. Later, however, in 1889, Mwanga managed to regain his throne only to be exiled to Kisimayu, as already indicated, in 1899, where he died in 1903."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.62, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""However, as Professor Adu Boahen has correctly pointed out, it is a distortion of African history to see it in terms of heroes and villains. This approach fails to consider the prevailing circumstances under which various groups or individuals operated. The options available to them and their interpretations of these options may have been different from those imposed on them by politicians and scholars alike. It makes sense, as Boahen has suggested, to see the events of the time and their key actors in terms of diplomacy, pursued independently or backed by force. To appreciate the extent to which diplomacy could go, it is necessary to understand the socio-economic forces operating in a particular society at the time of the encounter. For East Africa, a survey of such factors in the 1890s will be an appropriate setting for the events that followed. But, as R. I. Rotberg and Ali Mazrui state: 'There is no gainsaying that the introduction of Western norms and power and accompanying controls was everywhere in Africa questioned by the people affected'. 2 This questioning, however, took various forms. 'The response to the in› vasion was determined by the structure of each society at the time. Though all societies were determined to preserve their sovereignty, the reaction to invasion was not uniform.'$^{3}$ Variations occurred in accordance with the social cohesion or otherwise of a given society.\nIn the 1890s - the period that preceded European occupation of East Africa - the societies of the region had achieved differing stages of social organization.$^{4}$ Some, such as the Baganda and the Banyoro in Uganda, the Banyambo in Tanganyika (now Tanzania) and the Wanga in Kenya, had achieved a high degree of centralized government (see Fig. 7.1). In such societies, response to foreign penetration tended to be dictated by the king or the leadership as a whole. What had existed in Europe at one time - 'The religion of the king is my religion' - sums up the attitude well. Other societies, such as the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika or the Nandi in Kenya were in the process of forming centralized governments. This process is often referred to as state formation.

For this purpose a combined caravan of some 1,500 men stationed at Kwa-Sundu [later Mumia] was marched upon them.

They had less direct or even indirect dealings with the foreigners from the coast; in fact in many cases they were unwilling to welcome these foreigners into their societies, although they were willing to sell foodstuffs to caravans on the stopping stations.

It was Sir Robert's desire, therefore, to pursue an active political role in Madagascar. This policy, coinciding as it did with Radama's own determination to expand to the east, was to have, as one writer has put it, 'important consequences for the future of Madagascar'. 12 After several friendly contacts, Farquhar sent a diplomatic mission, led by Captain Le Sage, which arrived in Antananarivo on 21 December 1816. A treaty of friendship and commerce was eventually signed on 4 February 1817 between Radama and Le Sage. But this treaty did not satisfy the Mauritian Governor because it did not mention the slave trade, a matter of considerable importance to Sir Robert.

When Radama argued that by doing this he would be com› mitting economic suicide because the slave trade was the major source of his revenue, Hastie had a ready answer: the British would pay the Malagasy ruler an annual sum of 1000 dollars in gold, 1000 dollars in silver, a hundred barrels of gunpowder, 100 English muskets with 100 flints, 400 soldiers' uniforms, 12 sergeants' swords, 600 pieces of cloth, a full-dress uniform for himself and 2 horses as compensation.$^{14}$ Radama considered that he had made a fair deal, especially since the treaty also recognized him as king of the whole of Madagascar.

It seemed to us so advisable in the interests of African civilisation that he should be not only allowed, but encouraged and assisted to do so, that we have strenuously advocated the measure. In our May number we made some comments on a letter of the late Commodore on the West Coast station; in which, in pursuance, as we believed of orders from home, the King of Dahomey\'s request was refused. Our correspondence from Dahomey shows us, however, that the King has not accepted this reply of the Commodore as a final decision against him, but has applied directly by letter to Her Majesty\'s Government with the same object. In the article in our May number before alluded to we exposed the error and inconsistency of such a refusal as had been given to the King, and endeavoured once again to show how much that change which we so desire for Dahomey and Ashantee might possibly be forwarded by bringing some of the chief men of those countries into immediate personal contact with our advanced civilisation and all the humane institutions to which the blessed precepts of the Gospel of Peace have given rise among us. There is nothing more necessary to be shown to the authorities of those barbarous countries than the value which we attach to human life; and that although unhappily wars have not ceased among so-called Christian nations, human life is, except upon the battle-field, regarded as a sacred thing, in no case to be wantonly taken away, and in all cases to be hedged round by the supreme authority with all possible protections. We do not know what may be the decision of our Government, and what answer may be sent to the King of Dahomey. We have reason, however, to believe that the arguments put forward by us have not been without effect in modifying opinions in quarters where opposition to the King of Dahomey\'s wishes was known to exist. There is consequently reason to hope that a favourable answer may be accorded, at least to the extent of meeting the King\'s wishes that some of his chiefs should come over to this country, by offering those facilities without which it would be difficult, if not impossible, for them to do so. This, and a formal reception of such envoys by Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, are two very different things. If the latter could by any possibility be construed into an approval of, or even into a cessation of protest against, those horrible barbarities by which Dahomey is polluted, especially in those superstitious ""Customs"" in which human life is so wantonly destroyed, we should say at once that such envoys should not be admitted, either formally or informally, to the Royal presence; but if, as we think there is reason to believe, the personal displeasure of our Sovereign at such atrocities, pronounced by herself in presence of those envoys, might have the effect of inducing the King to put an end at once and for ever to his slave wars and to those appalling ""Customs"" for which Dahomey has become so infamously distinguished, we do venture to express the hope that in the event of the envoys arriving here, some means may be devised by which they may thus become assured of Her Majesty\'s abhorrence of things in which the Kings of Dahomey have delighted, and that Her Majesty considers those things in which they have gloried as incompatible with the existence of any friendly understanding, or interchange of courtesies between herself and him. We do think that some means may be devised by which such a Royal Christian effort might be made in the cause of humanity and of Christian civilisation in Africa without any sacrifice of Royal dignity. The end in view is really a great one. The cessation of slave-hunting wars and of ""Customs"" in Dahomey, and the entry of that country, however feeble at first its steps may be, into the ranks of the world\'s advancing Christian civilisation, would have a great effect on the surrounding countries. A new way would be opened through Dahomey into the interior of Africa. And as the Dahoman Government has long since shown itself alive to the importance of good roads between its principal places, more might possibly be done within a short time in that than in any other native African country in establishing improved communications between the coast and the interior. The visit of the Dahoman envoys to this country, and their judicious reception and entertainment here, are therefore much to be desired. It would be absurd, of course, to bring them over at this time of the year, when they would be exposed to the rigours of winter; but we hope that such an answer may be given to the King\'s application, and such instructions be issued and arrangements made, as may lead to the presence of those men among us some time in the months of May or June of next year.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-09-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_09_1866#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'A Consul at Whydah', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'One of our best and most dependable authorities on the West Coast in questions relative to Dahomey writes strongly by the last mail, urging upon us to persevere in our endeavours to obtain that a consul be accredited to the King of Dahomey, to reside in the British Fort at Whydah.

We are glad, therefore, to have this confirmation of the soundness of our views in urging Her Majesty\'s Government, as the African-Aid Society has done, to send a consul to Whydah.\n\nOur correspondent says that he agrees entirely with what he has heard to be the opinions of Commodore Wilmot, who visited Dahomey in December and January last. He thinks ""that England has not, as a nation, given Dahomey that share of its attention which its peculiar position and circumstances relative to the slave-trade and to Abeokuta has claimed.""

It would involve no idea of *force* or *coercion*, and lead to no political complication."" He thinks the presence of a British consul there would rapidly lead to important agricultural and commercial results, which would soon weaken the *prestige* of the slave-trade in the minds of monarch and people, by opening to them other and better sources of national wealth.\n\nThe African-Aid Society has laboured continually for opening Dahomey to civilization and progress. It has always strongly recognised her great importance, both as regards the slave-trade—which her conversion to better practices would put an end to in the Bight of Benin—and also as regards the spread and increase of civilising commercial operations on the coast. We firmly believe that the time has nearly come when the great change we so desire, and have so ardently striven to procure, will take place in Dahomey.

The general messenger who came down here as usual reported no more on this occasion than that the King had arrived at Abomey, and that he was going out again. We did not even hear the name of the place that he had unsuccessfully attacked, but we know that he had taken very few captives—not sufficient for his next annual Custom; the consequence of which was that his Majesty was in such a horrible temper, that his people entreated him to lead them to the attack of some other place. What this place is we know not; but we know that he has gone upon this second expedition, and is expected back very shortly. He left Abomey for this new outrage some ten days ago. These expeditions injure legitimate trade very much, and are fast ruining the country.\n\nAnd now to show you what a strange country this is. Since the King last left, the Prime Minister from Abomey and the Governor of Whydah have been trying their hands at a new arrangement of trade at Whydah, by endeavouring to fix their own rate of prices for merchants' goods, &c. They have thus been doing great harm to trade, and have put everything in confusion. Rum has been of late the only article for trade at Whydah. A French ship arrived in the Roads with a cargo. They seized this opportunity, the King being absent, for obtaining their advantage. They compared all the measures in use here, and, finding the French measure rather larger than the others, they made this the standard. They then decreed that some 30 per cent. more rum than heretofore should be given for a certain quantity of oil, and that those whose measures had not been equal to that of the French should each pay a fine of a pipe of rum. Traders not acceding to these terms were to be excluded from the market. The meeting at which this determination was made known lasted some hours. No one was allowed to speak against it, and no decision was come to. Seeing they did not get on in this way with their project, they secretly influenced the Frenchman to give about 15 per cent. more rum, instead of 30 per cent. The traders were then all summoned to say what they would do. Some offered to do as the Frenchman had done. This was refused at first, but finally accepted.\n\nHaving thus far succeeded as regards rum, they proceeded to make demands as regards other articles, clothes of different kinds, roll tobacco, &c., &c. No conclusion has yet been arrived at in these matters, and we are hoping the King will soon return and give his attention to trade affairs, putting an end to all this injurious nonsense. You see this is a curious Government; and that they venture sometimes to do things without the King's knowledge, in order to obtain some advantage.\n\nI think I told you in my last that Mr. Craft, the agent of the Company of African Merchants, had opened the new school.

The former has been very highly received.\n\nThis year being ""The Lorsing,"" or Horse Custom, the usual shade has been made, and to each of the poles that hold up this shade—as I wrote you some time ago—men to be killed for this custom are bound. But one great consolation: instead of using men alone for this custom, the King made use of half of the number, and put actually horses between the men—i.e., one horse after a man; but only the men were killed—he spared the horses! This reduction of men was not caused by insufficiency of men; but God has been directing things in that way, and who knows whether the talk of Commodore Wilmot had something to do with this change? Hence, Mr. Editor, you see the necessity of not neglecting any means necessary towards that object which Christian England has in view with the King of Dahomey, for some good will come out, if proper trial be made. The King of Dahomey is very well disposed towards England; and if that Christian country use all her efforts, what may appear difficult for him to see now in the object of his best friend, the Queen of England, those kind efforts will force him to see; and this is evident from the change of feelings which the visit of Commodore Wilmot has brought about in the few months past. Before this visit we could hear nothing good of the English; nothing but abuse and every attempt to oppose any English movements in his country. We who bear the name of ""English people"" have had a great deal of trouble, but now there is nothing of the kind; every respect is paid to the English people, as the King\'s best friends.\n\nWe are expecting Captain Burton up from Fernando Po to go up to Abomey, Her Majesty\'s ship Antelope having left this station for him.

Of all desire for such enterprises Tonquin has cured them for a long time. They know too well the hardships and sufferings that are implied to echo the warlike wishes of the country. They know too well how many suffer and are worn out without recompense, how many have to struggle in obscurity after the conquest seems at an end, to encourage France with a light heart to enter upon enterprises of this kind so long as a really patriotic interest is not at stake. Henri Rivière was actuated by a personal ambition which urged him to adventures in Tonquin. This strange country, which it was thought could be conquered with fifty men, and which has not been subdued with 50,000, was more attractive than the miserable and deadly Dahomey. No; it is not the soldiers, not the seafaring forces, who favour an attack on Dahomey. You will be surprised when I tell you that it is the commercial houses established on the coast who desire to involve France in this enterprise, and who employ the most extraordinary means to accomplish their ends. It is not the first time that such things have happened. We have seen them in Senegambia and elsewhere at work in the same way. It is sometimes missionaries, sometimes employés on the coast, who have lost their way as if by accident in the interior, and who almost provoke their capture, who enable the trading houses to make a great noise and to call for the intervention of the mother country, and who involve it in a war of conquest. They do so because by this means their fortunes are increased a hundredfold, for a factory worth 10,000f. on a coast under savage rule is worth 1,000,000f. on one which has become French.\n\nNow, on the coast of Dahomey the most important business house is at the same time the one most skilful in pushing its interests by the most varied means. The firm is now Monte & Fabre, but in reality it is simply the old house of Régis, the first settled on the coast. Curious stories are told of its early doings. It is said that it began by collecting shells which the King of Dahomey used as money. Goods were purchased with them, about which statements are made which it would now be difficult to verify. In our time the shells are no longer used as coin, and the merchandise is one of a kind now difficult to remove. Accordingly the old house of Régis, young again in its successors, would not object to a change enabling it to carry on business not on Dahomian but on French territory, or on territory protected by France.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1890#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Hope in Dahomey', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'she has been so richly endowed by nature. In this number of our journal we have also to record the painful news of an active foreign slave-trade at Whydah—of the shipment of nearly 1,000 poor wretches in one steamer, destined for the disgusting shambles of the modern plantations of Cuba, there to be used up in eight or ten years in the production of sugar for the British market. We cannot forget that, on those 1,000 slaves alone, the King obtains a fancied profit of some 10,000l., which we enable the Cuban planters to send him, through the slave-traders, for the supply of the raw material out of which they manufacture sugar for us. We are compelled to bear in mind that at the rate of duty he levies on palm oil shipped at Whydah—viz., one dollar per puncheon—there must be a very large exportation of produce to compensate him for relinquishing the slave-trade. We have also recently obtained a new insight into the dreadful ""Customs"" of Dahomey—of the supposed obligation on the part of the monarch to continue them during his life; and Aboekuta, though a hard nut, perhaps, to crack, has in its numerous population a delicious kernel for the wholesale butcher and slave-dealer. Nevertheless, we hail with joy this manifestation on the part of the King of a desire to enter into some amicable relations with the Christian civilization of this country. And we do indeed earnestly hope that advantage will be taken of it by Her Majesty\'s Government. We stated in our last that Commodore A. Eardley Wilmott had been furnished by them with the presents that would be requisite should he attempt a visit to Abomey. And we know his earnest desire to detach the King of Dahomey from the slave-trade. We have, therefore, reason to believe that when he receives, by the mail which leaves Liverpool to-morrow, this interesting intelligence, which has been communicated through us, he will lose no time but proceed to Whydah as soon as his other duties will permit. The King asks for the light to be brought to him; and such a desire ought to be immediately gratified. It may be only curiosity on his part, or a desire for the presents which he well knows he will receive; or to raise himself still higher in the opinion of his people, through that acknowledgment of him as king by this great nation; or it may be only a ruse on his part, to lull the Aboekutans into a fancied security, so that they may become an easier prey. Still, his desire ought to be complied with; the wishes, and, if necessary, the demands, of this Christian country ought to be diplomatically placed before him. The person whom he has named as interpreter should accompany the British negotiator. And then, should all fail—should no good result be obtained—we shall have at least the satisfaction that we performed our duty. We are not sanguine of any immediate good result, because we have no reason to believe that the negotiator has any power to promise a subsidy on the part of this country, which might compensate (until legitimate commerce should be largely developed) for the fancied pecuniary loss the King would sustain by the abandonment of the slave-trade. But we might expect to learn the amount of subsidy that would induce such abandonment; and it would then be for this country to determine whether it would be our duty or our interest to pay the price.', 'last_edit_date': '1862-12-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1862#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Sir,—I learn from Whydah that the King of Dahomey has sent invitations for all the residents to attend the annual custom at Abomey.

Ships and troops are to hand, which are certain ultimately to overcome resistance; and treaties get signed, which confer fresh privileges and facilities on the merchant.

On the Dahomey coast a French firm of old standing flourishes, of a kind which would gain rather than lose by the intervention of the arms of the Republic in Dahomey. The suggestion from Paris is that the house could not object to a course likely to issue in the extension of French rule, or a French protectorate, to Abomey and Whydah. With this idea, subordinates appear to have entered rashly upon expeditions likely to place them in the position of hostages. In such cases inconveniences which white men have subjected themselves to have been exaggerated into outrages. Any factory is sure to have on hand an amount of honest recklessness sufficient to arouse a conflagration of civilised and savage prejudices. Without intention of self-deception, merchants advise according to their private inclination. The charge thus brought against its countrymen is very serious, and ought to put the Government of France on its guard against appeals for armed redress.

But, no—""whenever the King of Dahomey renounces the slave-trade, gives up human sacrifices, and commences in real earnest the pursuit of legitimate trade,"" then, and not till then, ""it will be time to consider his proposal"" to be allowed to send some of his subjects—his nobles—to England. When he has made so much progress in civilized ideas that the visit of his people to England will have become comparatively unimportant, then they may come. If there were not great interests of humanity, civilization, and Christianity at stake, we might laugh at the absurdity; but when we look at the results to be obtained by the civilization of Dahomey and of Ashantee, and see such a policy as that under consideration announced from England, our heart almost fails within us. Those two countries are being annually drenched with the blood of victims of an atrocious barbarism, and that blood flows, for the most part, not because of a wanton exercise of a savage despotic power, but at the behests of a most sanguinary superstition. And we prefer to cure these people by offering them the bribe, that if they will first become good, and righteous, and humane, and enlightened in their ideas, some half-a-dozen or more of them shall really be brought over to England to have the honour of a peep at us! If they will swallow our pill first, we will, perhaps, give them (""it will be time to consider his proposal"") a little jam and honey afterwards. And this is the way in which our Government, as a Government, thinks that African civilization may be accomplished. The English people, as individuals, know better. They do not say to the poor wretched victims of a cherished barbarous superstition, cast off your false religion, acknowledge two or three of the great truths of Christianity, and then we will see, perhaps, what can be done for you. No, they send their missionaries to tell them what Christianity is—to show them the difference between what it inculcates, and the bloody system under which they have been for so many ages the benighted victims. And why does not the English Government act on the same principles? Does official position, does official life, remove the members of a Government out of the sphere altogether of the principles and sentiments which would influence and govern them as individual Englishmen? It seems very much like this. We cannot send our civilization to Dahomey and Ashantee for them to look at it and contrast it with their own barbarism, as missionaries can show them the simple truths of Christianity, and ask them to compare them with the foul teachings of their Fetish priests. All the sample of civilization we can send them, after having encouraged their sanguinary systems for ages by our long and active prosecution of the slave-trade on their coasts, is war ships and cannon engaged in protecting legitimate trade, and putting down that slave-trade we so long encouraged and participated in; that according to the ideas of those people, we have only abandoned it because we do not want it any longer, and, like dogs in the manger, refuse to let others eat of what we do not ourselves require. Traders, eager, of course, as traders must be, in the pursuit of gain, ""guns, drums, trumpets, blunderbuss, and thunder,"" war ships, and an occasional missionary, are all the show of civilization we can make to them in their own lands. The mountain cannot go to Mahomet, but Mahomet can be brought to the mountain. We cannot extend civilization and its fruits to the Dahoman and Ashantee anywhere but in England. They begin to know and feel this, and are not at all so unreasonable as we are. They do not say, send England over here that we may look at it, but, take us over to England that we may see what it is. And we want them to see it, or, at least, we ought to want them to see it. What is there, then, that stands in the way? There is no doubt in our own mind on the subject. It would cost a thousand pounds or two, and a little trouble, to gratify their wish. And so this great and noble nation takes refuge under a false and hypocritical exaction. And, of course, it does not expect to be found fault with. What can be better than the things it asks the Dahoman to do? Renounce the slave-trade, give up human sacrifices, buy cottons, guns, powder, and rum, and sell palm-oil and such other articles as your country produces! Who can find fault with this? Not we; only the demand or advice is not likely to be granted or acted upon. The people want an adequate motive for the change demanded. We try to give them one when we endeavour by our ships to make it impossible for them to sell slaves for export. And they understand this motive, because they feel the power of its working. Why not add another motive? Why not show them England and its civilization? Have we no faith in ourselves, or our civilization, or our religion, so that we fear their being too closely looked at by strange eyes? No, it is not this, it is that ignoble motive of a little money, as if civilised Dahomey and Ashantee would not repay it to the country ten thousand times over. Away with it.

Some anti-slavery journals appear to deprecate the use of force towards that monarch. They think that persuasion and entreaty should be brought to bear on him, with a view to induce him to desist from his practices of sacrificing human beings and engaging in slave-hunts. Persuasion, argument, and entreaty, have been repeatedly used on this present King of Dahomey and his predecessors, and used in vain. These kings tell us that it is the custom of their nation to hunt for slaves and to sacrifice human beings. He who is king is obliged to do these things. It is with him just as much a duty as the abiding by the advice of responsible ministers is with the Sovereign of Great Britain. If he abstained from these practices, his subjects would turn him out, and set up another man in his place, who would carry them out in accordance with immemorial usage. In order to put down these barbarous practices, only one course will avail—to use physical force. The British Government must say to the Dahomians, \'Sir, you are unwholesome in your habits and troublesome in your ways and practices. You won\'t live and let live.

The French nation has not shown much interest in this war: which has not even provoked enough criticism to be made a weapon of party controversy. They seem generally to have found no less difficulty in understanding its use or reason than the King of Dahomey himself whose request to President Carnot for enlightenment was published some weeks ago. And the French Ministry knows little more about it than the rest of the world. The popular belief has been that the Admiral on the West African station, and the military forces employed in garrison duty in the same district have tried to diversify their monotony by picking a quarrel. The account now published, if true, relieves them of the burden of such a reproach. Neither officers nor men have any inclination to force their country into speculative enterprises in such a region as the Slave Coast. Personally they are not likely to win glory thereby; and for the State the consequences of such a contest are both painful and unprofitable. For the ascertainment of the source of this inglorious business attention must be directed to a very different quarter. Arms and commerce are proverbially at strife. Everyone sympathises with the trader's complaint of the confusion which warfare introduces into his affairs. He is the natural advocate and friend of peace, at least when his relations are with communities as advanced and well-regulated as his own.

Those expectations were formed on the supposition that he might possess some few grains of common sense, which would place vividly before his mental vision the dangers of collision between an earthen pot and a sledge hammer wielded by an arm of power. It seems to be now past dispute that, instead of disowning the acts of the brutal authorities at Whydah, who showed themselves to be fit servants to such a master, he has put a bold front on the matter, and sent the insolent message that ""he will pay the Commodore in powder and bullets if he will come up to Abomey."" This is the language that might be expected only from a doomed idiot, vapouring among the spiritless slaves by whom he may be surrounded, and who have worshipped him as almost a god, until he believes himself to be quite one. It is clearly full time that both King and people should be undeceived by coming in rude contact with something more than a few European trading clerks and agents, who, naturally enough, in the interests of their trade, submit, uncomplainingly, to everything short of actual plunder and brutal violence. Our opinions and feelings respecting the frantic iniquity of Dahomey are so strong, and our conviction that it is the imperative duty of Great Britain, as the real protecting Power on the West Coast of Africa, to put a final end to its enormities as being a daily insult to humanity, is so unalterable, that all we can say in reply to the braggart King is that we hope he will continue in his present frame of mind, and not be moved to feigned repentance by the blockade of his sea-ports. We do not wish him to repent, and thus save himself and his authority from destruction—unless his repentance should go so far (which it never would do) as to secure his faithful acquiescence in British demands, that he should never henceforth make any inroads into Egba territories in search of victims for his atrocious festivals, and that those festivals of blood should be entirely put an end to. The earth has groaned long enough under this blood-thirsty monster, and the devilish system that he at this time represents. That system is incurable by any other means than the entire destruction of the Power with which it is identified, and of which it is an inseparable part.

He saw the British as an ally whom he could use to extend his influence over the whole of western Kenya, by helping him to defeat his neighbouring adversaries such as the Iteso and the Luo with whom he had been at loggerheads for quite some time. Wanga kings had a tradition of employing mercenaries to fight for their cause. Thus, in Mumia's thinking, the British were simply another group of mercenaries to be used. Likewise, the British saw in Mumia a willing agent to help them to extend their control over the whole area. Indeed, the British occupation of western Kenya was accomplished largely through his help. This debt was freely acknowledged by British officials, among whom was Sir Harry Johnston who noted that 'he [Mumia] from the very first regarded British officials and the idea of a British Protectorate with hearty good-will. His influence through all the troubled times of Uganda had done much to ensure the safety of British communications with the east coast'.$^{20}$ The same sentiments were echoed by another colonial official on the occasion of Mumia's death in 1949.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': 'The European Scramble for East Africa and the patterns of African resistance > The response in Uganda', 'content': ""Probably the greatest diplomat of all those who had to deal with the advent of imperialism in East Africa in the last decade of the nineteenth century was Mwanga, the Kabaka of Buganda, which had been declared a British Protectorate in 1894. When he ascended the throne in 1894, he seemed to be suspicious of Europeans, mostly missionaries at that time, so he sought to restrict his people's interactions with them. Those among the Baganda who had embraced the Christian faith and who would not obey his orders were put to death as traitors.$^{29}$ Today, Christians regard them as martyrs. Mwanga was, however, violently resisting attempts by British agents to take over his country even though disguised as mission› aries. But his diplomatic ability also became apparent in the way he handled various, often warring religious sects. At one time, he would play the two Christian sects, Catholics and Protestants, against Muslims when he thought the latter were becoming too powerful and therefore threatening his control of the country. At another time, he would ally with Muslims against Catholics or Protestants or both depending on who he thought was dangerous to his rule. Thus, Mwanga was adept at the diplomatic game of divide and rule, a tactic which the colonizing powers were able to use so effectively in controlling Africa. When it was necessary, Mwanga resorted to a revival of some old tradition in an attempt to drive out all foreigners as happened in 1888.$^{30}$ On this occasion, he intended to entice all foreigners and their Baganda followers to a naval parade on an island on Lake Victoria. There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler. Later, however, in 1889, Mwanga managed to regain his throne only to be exiled to Kisimayu, as already indicated, in 1899, where he died in 1903."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': 'The European Scramble for East Africa and the patterns of African resistance > The response in Uganda', 'content': 'There were, however, those among the Baganda who allied themselves firmly with British imperialism in what has come to be known as Baganda sub-imperialism with regard to the rest of Uganda.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Central Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'The struggle to maintain independence: the era of confrontation and alliance', 'content': 'African rivalries, moreover, facilitated a strategy of divide and rule which Harry Johnston and other colonial officials employed with consum› mate skill.

The Inhambane Tonga and the Sena helped the Portuguese against their respective Shangaan and Barue overlords, while in the Congo a number of subject people co-operated with the Belgians to free themselves from Yeke and Arab rule or from the slave raiders.

The interrelationship between kingship and fertility underpinned the mys› tification of the ruler and reinforced his position as symbolic owner and spiritual guardian of the land. As a result, he retained the exclusive right to allocate land, which was the basis of control over subordinate chiefs and other subjects and underpinned a cycle of reciprocity.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey.

Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading. One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority. Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage.

There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years.

As we have seen above, the fundamental issue at stake between the 1880s and the 1900s as far as the African rulers were concerned, was that of sove› reignty, and on this, it was quite clear that nobody was prepared to compromise. Those African rulers who have been mistakenly termed collaborators were those who thought that the best way of safeguarding their sovereignty or even regaining the sovereignty that they might have lost to some African power previous to the arrival of the Europeans was not to collaborate but rather to ally with the European invaders. A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation. But as we have seen, the Africans were all faced with the question of surrendering, retaining or regaining their sovereignty. Those who threw in their lot with the Europeans therefore had their own objective, and it is therefore totally wrong to call them collaborators.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': ""Because of their exclusion, the new elites went into open opposition against the colonial powers.

In any case if they accepted the arguments of the new elites, they would be consigning themselves to second or even third place.

The mission of these Envoys marks a stage in a series of negotiations. They are six in number, the chief amongst them being Prince A. A. Ossoo-Ansah, a son of Prince Ansah, who, in 1874, after the Ashanti War and the deposition of King Coffee, visited England for the purpose of clearing himself of imputations as to disloyalty to England during that war, and of obtaining compensation for the destruction of his property by the enemy. Prince Ossoo Ansah is the only one of the six who can speak English, and is appointed to act as interpreter and spokesman. The purpose of the visit has been stated in telegraphic despatches, but some fuller information is now available. It seems that the relations of Great Britain towards Ashanti have, with the sanction of the French Government, assumed somewhat new features, as it has been recognised as falling within the British sphere of influence. With the increased assurance of protection thus afforded, British traders have extended their operations in the country, which is extremely fertile in general produce, and especially rich in gold.

A man like the late Vice-Consul—who in 1871 adjusted the complicated disputes among the different native tribes on the Oil Rivers with such diplomatic tact and firm equity, as have justly rendered him much respected and loved by both Europeans and natives—if appointed, would not fail to be received with universal satisfaction.\n\nThe king, should he be effectively backed by such a consul, would, it is to be hoped, bring about such organic reforms in his country as should give a coup de grâce to its degrading, superstitious, and barbarous customs, and as should preclude the possibility of the commission, with impunity, of all those fiendish deeds and revolting atrocities, the accounts of which are so frequently detailed in public journals.—Believe me, Sir, sincerely yours,', 'last_edit_date': '1873-06-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_08_1873#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ENGLAND AND HER WEST AFRICAN COLONIES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Turning to the question of the political administration of the Colonies at the present time, he enumerated the different systems of government prevailing in the various British Colonies in Africa, and said that the great benefits derived by the Colonies from their annexation to England, whose constitutional monarchy was the most stable system of representative government to be found in the whole world, were conspicuous and great. England had extended to her West African dependencies the privileges of British legitimate trade and commerce, which was a powerful vehicle for the advancement of civilisation.\n\nBringing forward the commercial advancement of the West African Colonies, he said the question had often been asked, ""Do the Colonies pay?"" He could answer with an emphatic affirmative. In 1837 the total external trade of England with all the Colonies was £28,341,471; it was now nearly £300,000,000, thus showing an increase of about ten times. The British shipping in connexion with the Colonies in 1837 was 3,677,975 tons; in 1885 it was 56,611,075 tons. The English Customs returns reckoned the exports to the Colonies in 1837 at £11,283,363; and this had since risen to £54,545,553. Her Majesty\'s Colonies, he said, furnished more than a quarter of the whole world\'s annual supply of gold. He then referred to the commercial geography of the British African Colonies, gave the value of their exports and imports, and reviewed the trade generally. The construction of a railway to the interior of Africa from Lagos was a recent proposition and a new feature in the history of the West African Colonies. It was obvious that Africa was, or would be, the only continent open for the future expansion of British manufacture; in such a case the interior would play an important part. He maintained, with eminent authorities on the subject, that by native agency alone, under foreign supervision necessarily, could tropical Africa be gradually and definitely developed on any permanent basis, and that the negro should be educated industrially and otherwise with the generous help of Europe and America. Whatever was accomplished by native agency, England certainly should carry the credit of effecting such accomplishment in the civilisation of Africa. It was beyond doubt that the English were acknowledged the best colonisers; and the marked consideration invariably shown by them to the people whom they undertook to govern, the extreme liberty and entire privileges of a British subject extended to every native, and the judicious caution characteristic of the policy of the British Government had altogether won for England this success and the preference to all other civilised nations.

H. K. Karskoth-Hugessen, M.P., Under-Secretary for the Colonies, delivered a lecture on 23rd October, to the members of the Deal and Walmer Institute, on ""The Colonies, and their Government by the Mother Country."" First, he desired to say how entirely he agreed with the opinion implied in the question, ""What would Great Britain be without her colonies?"" There had been from time to time statesmen who had let fall words from which it had been inferred that they regarded colonial possessions at a low value. They had talked of the evils contingent upon such possessions, the vulnerable point for assault which they afford to an enemy in time of war, of the difficulty and delicacy of the relations between a mother country and a dependency; daily increasing in wealth and population; and they maintained that our trade and commerce would be equal in magnitude and extent if each great colony were an independent country. For his part, he differed entirely from such views as these. He thought—nay, he maintained, as an undoubted and incontrovertible fact—that our colonies had been, and still are, of immense service to us; that by their means, the name, the credit, and the prestige of England had been heralded throughout the world; that trade had followed the flag; that by means of them commerce, free of labour for our surplus population, for whatever small force our active spirits had, been, had been opened to us through our colonies; and that it was the duty of every patriotic Englishman to cherish the colonial connection, and to do his utmost to strengthen the tie which bound and united together the mother country and the colonies, to their great and mutual advantage. (Cheers.) He might go even further. There could only be one colonial policy by which any government in this country could stand or fall. Any government which rightly interpreted, and desired duly to represent, the feelings and wishes of the people, must be anxious to cherish and encourage the party at home, and it was little less than a crime for speakers or writers to insinuate that any government desired to alienate the colonies. Such insinuations were only made to serve the object of political partisans, and they might depend upon it that whatever occasional difference there might be in the management of details, any and every British government, from whatever political party it might be chosen, had only one and the same general colonial policy to pursue. (Hear, hear.) Having spoken of the number and position of the British colonies, the manner in which they came into the possession of Great Britain, and the different forms of government which they enjoyed, the honourable gentleman, when dealing with the West Coast of Africa, referred to the somewhat curious fact that while those settlements were originally founded principally for the purposes of the slave trade, they were now, under a wiser and more human policy, made use of for precisely a contrary object—viz., a station from which our efforts might be directed towards the suppression of that cruel and nefarious traffic. These efforts had been attended with very great success. Moreover, these were African settlements which had been centres from which good and brave men had gone forth into the interior of the continent of Africa, and they by their energy and zeal had been created, often at the cost of no means a secondary order of importance, the blessings of Christianity and civilization, and reached those nations who, but for the British settlements, would have still remained in dark and heathen ignorance. (Cheer.) The good work, however, was not yet half done, and there were many obstacles in the way. The missionaries and the civilizing traders had much to contend against, besides the natural difficulty of overcoming native ignorance and prejudice. A committee of the House of Commons sat in 1865 ""to consider the state of the British establishments on the Western Coast of Africa."" After a long and careful inquiry, the committee reported that ""it is impossible to withdraw the British Government wholly or immediately from any settlements or engagements on the West African Coast."" But it went on to say that if further extension of territory or assumption of government, or new treaties offering any protection to native tribes, would be inexpedient, and that the object of our policy should be to encourage in the natives the exercise of those qualities which may render it possible for us more and more to transfer to them the administration of all the governments, with a view to our ultimate withdrawal from all, except, probably, Sierra Leone."" The main object of that committee, which was doubtless actuated by the best possible motives, was to save this country the expense of these settlements, and the complications with native tribes which had occasionally taken place. For his part, however, he could not look forward to any such contingency. He hoped that, in spite of this report of the House of Commons Committee, settlements which had already effected so much good, and through whose agency so much more might still be done, would never be abandoned by Great Britain; and he believed, moreover, that eventually an increasing and developing trade would make their continued occupation more and more desirable on commercial grounds, while there was good reason to hope that before long they might become entirely self-supporting. (Cheers.) . . . Having given a description of the institution of the Colonial-office in London, and remarking that on all the departments able and experienced men were employed, Mr. Hugessen went on to deal with the duties of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, and, replying to questions, he mentioned that during three weeks last session, when members of the Government had to stay up in the House of Commons until one, two, or three in the morning four days out of the seven, the average number of despatches that passed through his hands was 84 a week, or 14 a working day. . . . The Colonial-office, however, was not the only channel through which communications were interchanged between the mother country and the colonies. There were two very important gentlemen called the Crown agents, whose office was in Spring-gardens. They were appointed by the Secretary of State at fixed salaries, and the numerical strength and cost of their clerical staff was fixed by the Treasury. Their office was, in fact, a branch of the Colonial-office, and was most valuable to the colonies. They made no personal profit whatever from their agency, as other agents did, but received either a small fixed annual sum, calculated on the average percentage on business transacted. The duties performed by this branch of the office were of a most important and varied character. . . . In his concluding remarks, Mr. Hugessen said that he had heard how colonial matters were treated in Downing-street, and he was glad to say that he believed such matters were regarded by the public with greater interest than was formerly the case. (Hear, hear.) He earnestly desired to encourage the interests of the colonies, and thus to foster and stimulate political union.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-10-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_12_1872#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'OLD CALABAR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—As one deeply interested in the state of matters along the whole of the West Coast of Africa, it will gratify you to know that matters are moving on much more smoothly here than for some time after the death of King Archibong III. There was then no one ready to step into his place. It is true that on the last and biggest day of King A.\'s funeral solemnities the young man then called Prince Duke was, in the presence of all the head men of the town, the representatives of the neighbouring districts, and most of the European traders, presented to our late esteemed Consul Hopkins as King-elect of Duke Town; but several of the influential families of the town seemed disposed to contest his claim, and so, at an after convention, a sort of compromise was made by the appointment of a Regency, with a quiet gentleman, of the name of Efi Watt, as its nominal head. It was found, however, after some months\' trial, that the Regency system would not work. As of old, in a certain country lying north-east from us, ""when there was no king, every man""—every freeman or gentleman—""did that which was right in his own eyes.""\n\nWhen the Consul and the Commodore came here on special business in the month of March last, it was felt that the want of a responsible head in the country was a great hindrance to the proper transaction of public international business.\n\nThe Acting Consul spent a few days of last month on a visit to the river, and on the morning of the last day of his visit, Saturday, April 17, some of us were startled by receipt of an official notice, ""On Her Britannic Majesty\'s Service,"" intimating that Prince Duke was to be crowned King of Duke Town, at 12 o\'clock noon, on the hulk Matilda. This was so utterly unlike all former coronations which we have seen or heard off here, that we could only conclude that the Consul must have been acting under special instructions from the Foreign Office. The ceremony, such as it was, took place in the presence of a select few. Most of the European traders were present, but comparatively very few of the natives. No representative of the mission was present. The senior brother had a notification of what was to take place, but as it was not accompanied, as on former occasions of the same kind, by a request to conduct a suitable religious service, he thought it better not to be present. It was so far satisfactory to learn that the new King, who is styled **King Duke Ephraim Eyamba IX.**, signed an agreement binding him to observe the various treaties which have been made between British functionaries and his predecessors.', 'last_edit_date': '1880-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SIGNS OF CHANGE—FRUIT OF MISGOVERNMENT.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'MR.

There appears to be some foundation for believing that a military expedition has been sent to Coomassie, or is about to be, for the purposes of compelling the King of Ashanti to accept a British Resident at his capital, whether the same be just, expedient, or otherwise. It is but fair (and Englishmen always boast of their fairness) that our Government and the King of Ashanti should have the like opportunities of putting their case before the British public, although I am aware that the public Press is not exactly the constitutional medium generally appealed to. The Ambassadors, however, are in London, and having appealed to the Government for a hearing (which has been refused), they can but now appeal to the Press for the ventilation of their alleged grievances—the more especially as I understand that the British Government are not slow on occasions to recognise that as a correct medium. According to my instructions, it would appear that Prempeh was not elected to the stool of Ashanti by us, so much so that we refused to interfere with the Ashantees\' selection at all, but fully recognised their action by having present our official representative at the coronation, and acknowledged him as King of Ashanti. There cannot be any manner of doubt about this, as it is borne out by the Blue records from 1888 to 1894. I am also told that when the British Government submitted the proposal that a British Resident should be received, the King was correctly designated by us as ""King of Ashanti,"" although at that time we were aware of the fact now alleged that ""the old Ashanti Confederation"" has been broken up""—a confederation which, I am instructed, had never existed. My clients emphatically deny that the King has ever broken or violated any of his treaty engagements. They deny, too, that he has countenanced human sacrifice, a fact which I am told is negatived by our own records; nor has he, it is urged, hampered trade and attacked tribes under British protection. It is also denied that he has raided for slaves. On the contrary, my clients inform me that the King has cause to complain of want of frankness towards him, and that our representative in the Gold Coast, while professing friendship towards the King, has, as a fact, been acting contrary to his pledges. The King is prepared to open his country to British skill, and does not seek to hamper trade as is suggested. The Ambassadors submit that the fact of Ashanti being ""within the sphere of British influence"" does not carry away the King\'s independence as a sovereign, nor justify the hostile attitude our Government are assuming. That the King is an independent sovereign, there cannot be any question in the face of the reply of the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, given in February last, and if England claims the right to send a mission to the King whenever she feels inclined, my clients urge that the same privilege should be extended to their King when he is acting with bona fides and in the honest belief that he is acting within his rights. The mission have travelled some thousands of miles to discuss the position and treat with her Majesty\'s advisers, and if only on the grounds of fair play, and apart from any precedent, the Government could receive them, there certainly would not be any particle of reason why one ounce of blood should be shed.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century.

There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler.

The mission of these Envoys marks a stage in a series of negotiations. They are six in number, the chief amongst them being Prince A. A. Ossoo-Ansah, a son of Prince Ansah, who, in 1874, after the Ashanti War and the deposition of King Coffee, visited England for the purpose of clearing himself of imputations as to disloyalty to England during that war, and of obtaining compensation for the destruction of his property by the enemy. Prince Ossoo Ansah is the only one of the six who can speak English, and is appointed to act as interpreter and spokesman. The purpose of the visit has been stated in telegraphic despatches, but some fuller information is now available. It seems that the relations of Great Britain towards Ashanti have, with the sanction of the French Government, assumed somewhat new features, as it has been recognised as falling within the British sphere of influence. With the increased assurance of protection thus afforded, British traders have extended their operations in the country, which is extremely fertile in general produce, and especially rich in gold. The Governor of Cape Coast Castle, Sir W. Brandford Griffith, has consequently been led to propose the extension of British authority in a more formal manner—the establishment of a British Resident at the capital, Coomassie (or Kumasi). This step having been taken, the next would naturally be the definite conversion of the country into a British Protectorate. But to this idea a considerable number of the Natives have expressed the most decided objection; and it is with the idea of expressing the popular feeling upon this point that these six ""ambassadors"" have been appointed with the intention that they should seek an interview with the Queen, and lay before her Majesty the reasons why such a course would be so unpopular among their people.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-05-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_05_1895#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ENGLAND AND HER WEST AFRICAN COLONIES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Turning to the question of the political administration of the Colonies at the present time, he enumerated the different systems of government prevailing in the various British Colonies in Africa, and said that the great benefits derived by the Colonies from their annexation to England, whose constitutional monarchy was the most stable system of representative government to be found in the whole world, were conspicuous and great. England had extended to her West African dependencies the privileges of British legitimate trade and commerce, which was a powerful vehicle for the advancement of civilisation.\n\nBringing forward the commercial advancement of the West African Colonies, he said the question had often been asked, ""Do the Colonies pay?"" He could answer with an emphatic affirmative. In 1837 the total external trade of England with all the Colonies was £28,341,471; it was now nearly £300,000,000, thus showing an increase of about ten times. The British shipping in connexion with the Colonies in 1837 was 3,677,975 tons; in 1885 it was 56,611,075 tons. The English Customs returns reckoned the exports to the Colonies in 1837 at £11,283,363; and this had since risen to £54,545,553. Her Majesty\'s Colonies, he said, furnished more than a quarter of the whole world\'s annual supply of gold. He then referred to the commercial geography of the British African Colonies, gave the value of their exports and imports, and reviewed the trade generally. The construction of a railway to the interior of Africa from Lagos was a recent proposition and a new feature in the history of the West African Colonies. It was obvious that Africa was, or would be, the only continent open for the future expansion of British manufacture; in such a case the interior would play an important part. He maintained, with eminent authorities on the subject, that by native agency alone, under foreign supervision necessarily, could tropical Africa be gradually and definitely developed on any permanent basis, and that the negro should be educated industrially and otherwise with the generous help of Europe and America. Whatever was accomplished by native agency, England certainly should carry the credit of effecting such accomplishment in the civilisation of Africa. It was beyond doubt that the English were acknowledged the best colonisers; and the marked consideration invariably shown by them to the people whom they undertook to govern, the extreme liberty and entire privileges of a British subject extended to every native, and the judicious caution characteristic of the policy of the British Government had altogether won for England this success and the preference to all other civilised nations.

Accra was nearly hidden in smoke, and it was feared the natives would expend their ammunition before the event of the day came off—a fear that was afterwards quickly dispelled.\n\nThe first company to arrive was that from the village of Teche, distant about fifteen miles, who, with their King at their head, banners streaming, war drums beating, and rifles waving, advanced at the double from eastward, and took up their position opposite Government House.

Viard visited Abeokuta, and in the name of the French Government made a treaty with one or two of its rulers.\n\nThere was considerable excitement in this colony in consequence, and a memorial, showing the loss to Lagos that would follow the ratification of such a treaty, was drawn up by the principal merchants, both European and Native, and presented to the Governor.\n\nThis memorial was afterwards supported by the Liverpool and Manchester Chambers of Commerce, and on the 25th of July last an influential deputation representing both Chambers had an interview with Lord Knutsford at the Colonial Office.\n\nWhile the apprehensions of the memorialists were in some degree set at rest by Lord Knutsford, who stated that the French Government had no intention of acting upon the political clauses of the treaty, no steps have apparently been taken to carry out one of the two important suggestions made by the deputation.\n\nThis suggestion was that treaties should be made, and, if necessary or advisable, small annual stipends paid to the rulers of districts adjoining British possessions generally, and especially that a new treaty should be made with Abeokuta. One already exists, but as it is dated 1852 it may have lapsed.\n\nTo understand the necessity for such treaties, it is sufficient to state that the town of Lagos is on an island about four miles long by two broad, and is only important from its position as the natural outlet for the trade of the 2,500,000 inhabitants of Zorubaland.\n\nIn 1886 the imports amounted to £358,000, the exports to £539,000, and at present the colony has a reserve fund of £38,000 to its credit.\n\nIt is estimated that two-fifths of the revenue are contributed by Abeokuta and its neighbourhood, so that anything which stops this trade means the loss of £20,000 a year to Lagos.\n\nThe administrative staff absorbs about £20,000 a year, and yet there are only two officials outside the bounds of the ""sickly sandbank"" on which Lagos is built.\n\nOne of these is stationed at Badagry to the westward, and one at Leckie to the eastward, of Lagos.

The expansion of the Empire itself must always remain the most striking feature of the Victorian age. When our Queen ascended the throne, even the most advanced of the British Colonies was scarcely half-developed: some, which are now among the most rapidly progressive, were then scarcely civilised, and less than half explored; while none had attained to the possibility of self-government, and the great Indian Empire itself was still under the authority of a mere trading company, and was governed in the name of respectable merchants, in an office in London! Africa, in which at the present time Great Britain holds an all but supreme position, was then scarcely more than a geographical expression, its coast-line hardly understood, and its vast interior utterly unknown, and popularly supposed to be desert.

We do not hesitate to say that 20,000l. a-year might be levied by duties on imports at Whydah. We do not wish to prejudge the results of Captain Willmott's visit to Abomey. Our correspondent at Whydah tells us that there is hope of amicable relations with Dahomey, and of the slave-trade being put an end to there. We are only too willing to share in this hope. But we think it right to show that, should the hope not be realised, there are still means for annihilating the slave-trade in the Bight of Benin, without any very heavy charge upon the home exchequer. And annihilated in the Bight of Benin the slave-trade never will be, while Cuba continues to import slaves, until the shipment of slaves from Dahomey and along the coast to the Volta be rendered impossible by the constant influence of British authority there. It is estimated that the revenue of the King of Dahomey from the slave-trade, and from licenses to trade and export duties at Whydah, amounts to 500,000 dollars a-year. One merchant at Whydah pays him 20,000 dollars a-year for a license to trade. It would be absurd for us to shut our eyes to these facts. If we cannot obtain the discontinuance of slave importation in Cuba, we must put an end to slave exportation from the coasts of Dahomey. And we understand that although the Kings of Porto Novo and Badagry are no longer mixed up actually with the slave-trade, they allow it to be carried on by Portuguese at their towns. And this reminds us that we have never yet received any explanation as to the grounds upon which we levy duties at Badagry. We give in another column a copy of a protest sent to Governor Freeman by the merchants of Badagry, when the duties, since modified and amended, were first ordered to be levied there. We do not defend the language employed by the protesting parties. But it shows that they were smarting under a keen sense of wrong done to them, according to their belief. We are not in possession of the Governor's reply to that protest. We must presume it will have shown the grounds on which he justified his order, and treated Badagry as a British possession, by levying duties there in the Queen's name, at a time when there was actually a British Vice-Consul there. We are aware that since the publication of our October article the Vice-Consul has been converted into a resident British agent; that his brother has been appointed magistrate; that a force of twelve native policemen are placed at the service of these authorities; and that the King and chiefs relinquish all right to levy duties, in consideration of a certain annual sum to be paid them by the Governor of Lagos.

When William IV. died (June 20, 1837), the Indian Empire was really but a geographical expression; Canada was of little account, either as a field of enterprise for our surplus population, or an appanage of the Crown; Australia was not opened up to commercial enterprise; and the British possessions in Africa consisted of little, if any, more than Cape Colony on the South and Sierra Leone on the West Coast.

There are many schemes before the public for insuring fitting memorials of the great occasion, but the one which appeals most directly to the amour propre of all Britons, and which indeed has the direct sanction of the popular Heir to the Throne, is the Imperial Institute, which is designed to serve at the same time as a memorial of the Jubilee and an institution which may afford a thorough representation of the progress achieved in the development of the resources of the Empire—a fitting national memorial of an epoch within.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-05-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_05_1887#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'On Sunday, June 20th, Her Majesty the Queen entered the fiftieth year of her reign.

The much-heralded black emigration schemes trumpeted by Garvey, whose ubiquitous publications reached deep into Africa, were only one example of a leitmotif which brought American blacks within the world view of African peoples. The themes of African redemption through American black missionaries were another.\nAfricans themselves, however, created the context of their next interaction with American blacks as they matriculated at American, largely Afro-American, schools and attended pan-African conferences and the like. Consequently, many Africans underwent a technical-educationalpolitical experience alien to their colonial world. When they re-entered their own worlds, many felt driven to resolve questions of ideology, cultural definition, educational values, political power, and pan-African unity or consciousness, guided by new perspectives.\nViewed against such an historical backdrop, the numerous pan-African conferences, Tuskegean educational and technical projects, the nØgritude movement and the occasional focus on American blacks in African millen› nial dreams, all illustrate the consistency of the pan-African theme among American and Caribbean blacks. They also show the variability of African responses to the New World overtures and ultimately the shaping by Africans themselves of these overtures to fit African specifications.\nIn sum, the populations of the African diaspora and the motive charac› terizing the many interactions between persons of the first and second black worlds included two visions. One was a vision of the union of religious forces among black populations in Africa and America or the reconstruction of Africa through importation of American and Antillean black technical expertise, initiated at the behest of American blacks. Another reflected the transformation of Africans from predicate to subject during the colonial period. The latter was a vision of the spiritual redemption, social recon› struction, and political reformation of African communities through the repatriation of African personnel and the energizing of African resources. Because of this vision, Africans had been educated in American schools, or sent to participate in technical and commercial activities; others were touched by American black writings or by anti-colonial ventures organized among blacks of the diaspora. This latter vision seemed not so much to discard as simply to vindicate and to reorientate to an African perspective the idealism implied in the earlier vision.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Back-to-Africa movements', 'content': ""Because of his general appeal to black pride, Garvey focused the attention of millions of American blacks on Africa in the period following the First World War.

Indeed, if anything, the emigration tradition championed earlier by blacks like Daniel Coker, Lott Cary, John B. Russwurm, Paul Cuffee, Henry H. Garnet and Martin R. Delany, was continued and enlarged upon in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. In 1878, for example, the South Carolina-Liberian Exodus Joint Stock Steamship Company brought 206 black immigrants to Liberia. In 1881, Henry H. Garnet was appointed resident minister and consul-general to Liberia, fulfilling his own earlier convictions; and in 1889, the St Thomas-born West Indian pan-Africanist, Dr Edward W. Blyden, visited the United States from Liberia on behalf of the American Colonization Society (ACS) to help generate black support for emigration. Moreover, between 1880 and 1900, Bishop Henry NcNeal Turner laboured to combine the two traditions long dominant in the modern history of African/Afro-American interaction: African emigration and Christian evangelism. Similarly, widespread interaction between Africans and American blacks occurred because of the return of thousands of Brazilian blacks to West Africa until the time of the official abolition of slavery in Brazil (1888). Upon resettlement in or near their previous homes in Nigeria, Dahomey (now Benin), Togo and the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the Afro-Brazilians' technical and commercial competence and political aspirations seem to have broadly affected the social, economic and political conditions there. Possibly because of the absence of differentiation of them› selves as a corporate community of settlers in their regions - such as was the case in Liberia - there were subsequently little differentiation between the social and political goals of indigenous Africans and Afro-Brazilians."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Back-to-Africa movements', 'content': ""Liberia - although founded by American whites through the ACS long before the period of the Scramble - occupies a special place in any con› sideration of immigration between different spheres of the black world.

Also, by 1892 black applications to the ACS for passage to Liberia had increased rapidly and several hundred black farmers from Arkansas and Oklahoma arrived in New York hoping to be transported to Africa. Moreover, in 1893, when he visited Liberia, Bishop Turner glowingly reported that 'one thing the Black man has here [in Liberia]... is Manhood, freedom; and the fullest liberty; he feels like a Lord and walks the same way'.$^{1}$ And again in 1896 he asserted: 'I believe two or three million of us should return to the land of our ancestors and establish our own nations, civilizations, laws, customs, style of manufacture ... and cease to be grumblers, chronic complainers and a menace to the white man's country he claims and is bound to dominate'.$^{2}$ Through Bishop Turner's efforts, over 300 Afro-Americans emigrated to Liberia in March 1896. Even the young W. E. B. Du Bois - later to be an opponent of emigration as a solution to black Americans' problems - endorsed Turner's emigration idea as a commendable alternative to 'the humiliating experience of begging for justice and recognition' in the United States. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Back-to-Africa movements', 'content': ""While in Liberia, Bishop Turner advised what he called American 'black capitalists' that 'if they would start trading with Liberia they would be worth millions in a few years'. Few responded, although a group did organize the African Development Society in 1899, the chief objective of which was to encourage Afro-Americans to buy land and settle in East Central Africa. The Society would sell shares or land rights offered by African petitioners but only to Afro-American or African purchasers. 4 Bishop Turner also later served as an adviser to the International Migration Society (IMS) of Alabama, which sent about 500 emigrants to Africa before it became defunct in 1900. Some of the 500 remained in Liberia; others returned to the United States. Those who remained fared reasonably well; evidently more than a few of them prospered. On the other hand, those who returned told horror stories of poor land, inadequate food and poor living conditions. These stories reduced the likelihood of any large-scale Afro-American emigration movement, even though prospects for blacks in the United States were declining from 1895 to 1900. Nevertheless, numerous Afro-Americans evidently continued to give serious consider› ation to African emigration, just as others in the United States and the Caribbean simply moved away from overt discriminatory practices into other regions near by.\nAfter the turn of the twentieth century, the back-to-Africa baton was picked up by others. For example, one Captain Dean, early in the twentieth century, hoped to engineer the settlement of American blacks in South Africa to fashion a powerful black state there. After the briefest sojourn meant to arrange for this settlement, however, white authorities expelled Dean from the Cape for what were termed 'provocative activities'. And in 1914, Chief Alfred C. Sam, a Gold Coast African, turned up in Oklahoma, persuaded about sixty black farmers that Africa offered them greater oppor› tunities and sailed with them to Saltpond in the Gold Coast. Finding Chief Sam's claims to be exaggerated and encountering restrictions from the Gold Coast officials which inhibited the entry of American immigrants, most of the Oklahomans eventually returned to the United States. But no one made so deep an impression as an advocate of emigration on Africans and American blacks alike as did Marcus Garvey who was born in Jamaica in 1887."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""with sections on Latin America and the Caribbean by ALBUQUERQUE MOUR˜O Substantial African expatriate communities or influences have affected such diverse regions of the world as classical Greece and Rome; Portugal (since the fifteenth century); the Caribbean; the United States (since the seven› teenth century); Britain (since the eighteenth century); Canada (particularly after the American War of Independence); Brazil (particularly since the eighteenth century); Saudi Arabia; India; and, occasionally, Turkey.

Repatri› ation during the nineteenth century offered few material rewards for Europeans or non-Europeans. But by 1900, the divergence between Africa and the Americas had become too great. Persons of African descent became caught up in the self-consciousness of the age which produced the type of xenophobic nationalism that all but destroyed the appeal of Africa. More› over, the interest in Africa after the end of the slave trade grew from national lusts for power and wealth - and Afro-Americans lacked both political power and the wealth needed to stimulate their own interest, or influence those who were partitioning Africa into colonial spheres. The Afro-American view became focused more on the new developments within their hemisphere. Internal and inter-regional migrations and the quest to establish the good life against new deleterious challenges absorbed their attention. The African connection faded, but did not die. The return-toAfrica movement found individual promoters who could occasionally infuse the movement with new appeal. In 1897, Henry Sylvester Williams, a Trinidadian-born lawyer living in London, founded the Pan-African Association, whose later membership would include George Padmore, Kwame Nkrumah and C. L. R. James. In the 1920s Marcus Garvey founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association, a movement designed to spur African decolonization and unite all Africans wherever they were found. Garvey's organization had branches in Canada, the USA, the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa.$^{57}$ By the time that Garvey's organization collapsed in 1927, Africa, and especially the Ethiopian question, had already begun to assume paramount importance in world affairs."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.721, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'Sierra Leone and Liberia', 'content': 'The second generation solved the problems of growth.

Success of the mission led to further invitations for missions to Tanganyika (now Tanzania), Zanzibar and Sudan; and to Washington being invited to set up shop in South Africa.\nRelated Tuskegee/Washington pan-Africanist activities included meet› ings of the Negro Business League in 1908, at which Washington showed his appreciation of pan-Africanism for African/Afro-American interchange.

In the USA, the idea of the repatriation of Africans had been mentioned occasionally throughout the eighteenth century, most notably in 1777, when Thomas Jefferson sponsored a report in a committee of the Virginia legislature. Repatriation began in earnest after 1815, however, when a small group of thirty-eight black Americans led by Paul Cuffe returned to Africa. By 1830, Liberia had become the focus for a general colony of repatriated Africans, mostly ex-slaves, sponsored by the American Colonization Society with the financial support of the Federal as well as many State governments. By i860, only about 15000 settlers had returned to Africa. After the Civil War, less than 2000 settlers made the trip, despite the rapid deterioration of the conditions of life for Afro-Americans in the USA.\nTwo other sources provided returning immigrants. The first came from the unknown number of maroons and Africans taken from confiscated slave ships during the nineteenth century, and shipped back to Africa by the British in their zealous attempt to terminate the trade in slaves and replace it by 'legitimate' trade. The second source of African returnees came from an even smaller number of missionaries recruited in the Caribbean and southern states of the USA, principally by the Moravians and Presby› terians, to assist in the propagation of the Christian Gospel in West Africa. The most well-known example of this is perhaps the Basel Mission enterprise among the Akwapim hills of Ghana in the 1830s and 1840s, and their decision in 1843 to use Jamaicans as substitutes for German and Swiss missionaries whose mortality in the field proved too high for evan› gelical efficacy."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.718, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Pan-Africanism: political and cultural aspects', 'content': ""Besides these educational exchanges, a series of pan-Africanist organizations and conferences, as well as commercial and literary or cultural activities 47.

The eventual substitution of French for Portuguese control of the area of the Gulf of Benin west of the Werne still left a residue of Latin culture sufficient to make Brazilians prefer this to the eastern coast, where Latin cultural influence was destined for eventual extinction.

It is not to be the healing up of an old sore, but the unfolding of a new bud, an evolution; the development of a new side of God's character, and a new phase of humanity.\n\nYou can easily see why one race overshadowed by another should long to express itself—should yearn for the opportunity to let out the divinity that stirs within it. This is why the Hebrews cried to God from the depths of their affliction in Egypt, and this is why thousands of Negroes in the South are longing to go to the land of their fathers. They are not content to remain where everything has been done on the line of another race. They long for the scenes where everything is to be done under the influence of a new racial spirit, under the impulse of new skies and the inspiration of a fresh development. Only those are fit for this new work who believe, in the race—a prophetic insight into its destiny from a consciousness of its possibilities. The inspiration of the race is in the race.\n\nOnly one race has furnished the prophets for humanity—the Hebrew race; and before they were qualified to do this they had to go down to the depths of servile degradation. Only to them were revealed those broad principles upon which every race can stand and work and grow; but for the special work of each race the prophets arise among the people themselves.""}, {'id': 6764, 'article_title': 'Elephants and the Ivory Trade', 'full_section_title': 'Elephants and the Ivory Trade', 'last_edit_date': '10-01-1896', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1896#article-8', 'issue_date': '01_10_1896', 'content': '""AFRICA FOR AFRICANS.""\n\nTO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.\n\nSIR,—Allow me to excite the interest of your readers in a scheme which I am at present promoting, on behalf of the African race, of which I am a member.\n\nThe project, briefly stated, is to acquire a tract of land in British Central Africa, and to utilise the descendants of the race now resident in the British West Indies for the purpose of developing its resources, and for the furtherance of civilisation among the Natives.

In August last he received at Lagos a representative deputation ""of the Brazilian and Havannah repatriates in the colony of Lagos."" It is not stated whether these representatives are pure negroes or mulattoes; but judging from their names—Senhor Ferreia, Senhor Agost Mendez, Senhor P. F. Da Costa—they seem to be a stage above the ordinary Brazilian negro. Moreover, the conclusion one naturally comes to from the tenour of the report of the meeting is that these representatives are Brazilian born and not emigrants from West Africa; therefore, it seems remarkable that they should be able to speak the language of the people of Yoruba, the country which lies inland from Lagos, and that the traditions and language of West Africa should be still kept up among the negroes on the other side of the Atlantic. In reply to the inquiry of the Governor these representatives assured him that all the negroes of Brazil wished to return to their country, although they admitted that the older men were much more anxious to return than the Creoles. At the same time they stated that the majority were anxious to ""repatriate"" themselves. The Governor immediately concluded that half the negro population of Brazil (1,000,000) were eager to leave the land where many of them had been slaves, and return to a country where, no doubt, they believe they will be absolutely independent. Poverty, the representatives stated, was the only thing that prevented them from carrying out their wishes. The Governor then informed the deputation that he had succeeded in inducing the commercial world to take an interest in this movement. The African Steamship Company have agreed to run their vessel, the Biafra, between Lagos and Brazil, purely, however, as a commercial speculation. The fares for negroes passing to and from Brazil will be as low as possible, while the deck accommodation will be comfortable. But the migration is not to be all on one side. The Governor of Lagos is convinced that negro labour is absolutely necessary to the development of the resources of Brazil, and now that a republic has been established, such labour will be more and more in demand. Moreover, there is already a fair trade between West Africa and Brazil, which is no doubt capable of considerable extension. Sir Alfred Moloney\'s idea, therefore, is not only to encourage the ""repatriation"" of Brazilian negroes but to establish a system of contract labour, by means of which the West African native may go to Brazil for a series of years, and return home with his savings, with habits of industry, and possibly with the knowledge of some handicraft. The Governor is persuaded that this would be good for his colony. At present these West African colonies are dependent upon one commodity, oil, and they have suffered much from recent depreciation in its price. Governor Moloney has done much to induce the natives to attend to other products, natural and introduced. If, therefore, the repatriation of Brazilian negroes will stimulate the stay-at-home native to the industrial development of their country, much good will be done. But that is the question. From the history of Liberia it seems doubtful whether the native will be able to do more than scrape together a bare living. Moreover, it seems very likely that 1,000,000 Brazilian negroes and half-castes are awaiting ""repatriation"" in a country where they would not be half as well off as they are at present. Still, Sir Alfred Moloney\'s experiment is worth making, and everyone will wish that the result may be for the good of the ""repatriates,"" the natives, and the colony generally. It may be remembered that a somewhat similar movement is on foot in the United States; and no doubt if half the present negro population of North America could be deported to Liberia, the Congo, and elsewhere in Africa, it would be a great relief to their present country.—*Times.*', 'last_edit_date': '1890-11-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/07_11_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The example and supervision of great numbers of educated Europeans will be necessary.

It may, perhaps, be reasonably held that the advance of civilisation will be more rapid than Sir George Goldie ventures to anticipate, and that some now living may see prosperous negro communities developing the rich soil of Central Africa, with their lives unshadowed by the horrors of bloodshed, slavery, and cruel superstition. It will be interesting in connexion with this subject to watch the outcome of Sir Alfred Moloney's proposal for the repatriation into his colony of Lagos of negroes from Brazil, as the success of this scheme would be a strong encouragement to the larger proposals to which Dr. Blyden has for many years devoted his talents—namely, the repatriation of the negroes from the United States. It is admitted by the Niger Company that they already have to depend largely in their territory on the services of their coloured officials, natives of the British Colonies, who have proved invaluable for treaty-making and diplomatic intercourse with the native chiefs, as well as for the development of new products in which the Company has apparently made rapid progress.\n\nSir George Goldie does not refer, however, in his article to two of the most important features in the policy of the Company.

The great future wealth of the interior plateaux will certainly lie in their mineral deposits, the riches of the West Coast region lie in its numerous and valuable vegetable products, of which the most striking are palm oil, and ground nuts, benniseed, shea butter, rubber, gums, spices, cotton, dyes, and valuable timbers, among which ebony occupies a prominent place. With regard to animal products, I might mention ivory and monkey skins. Whereas some of the great races of the interior speak languages which connect them with the Hamitic and Semitic families. The native inhabitants of the West Coast are all that there is of most typically Negro in character; yet I do not mean they are races of particularly low development; on the contrary, the typical Negro is a fine specimen of man, and is by no means as low in his mental state as the races of Polynesia and America. I may cite the Kru tribes of that portion of West Africa which is known as Liberia, a country inhabited by an industrious, energetic, hardworking, stalwart population of free men. An element of heterogeneous ex-slave settlers among the tribes of the coast may be found in some parts of the Colonies of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos. These people represent the Nemesis which invariably follows national crimes. We and our American children indulged to a greater extent than any other European nation in the African slave trade, and, as our wrong-doing was violent and exaggerated, so to a certain extent was the abrupt reparation which followed. Although I would not minimise the work done by our blockade on the West Coast, the abolition of the slave trade was more effectually brought about by the abolition of slavery in the United States of America. One result of our suppression of the slave trade in West Africa has not been altogether advantageous. I refer to the Slave Colonies established at Sierra Leone, and at Fernando Po and other points on the coast. It may be taken that the slaves exported from any district are the least worthy people in it, and the result is that a large proportion of this population is descended from the sweepings of West Africa, and has not yet passed through sufficient generations to eliminate the ancestral badness of its progenitors. So, although here and there a negro has shown what the race can attain to under favourable circumstances, still the bulk of the ""S\'a Leone"" people who are scattered up and down the coast are of an undesirable character, and the cause of indiscriminating blame on the part of superficial observers which is most unjustly laid on the shoulders of the entire population of West Africa; whereas many of these races are superior in intelligence, enterprise, and integrity to any of our negro fellow-subjects in South Africa or the West Indies. What admirable recruits to civilised society can be obtained from many of these people may be instanced by such men as Bishop Crowther, Archdeacons Johnson and Crowther, Samuel Lewis, and other divines and lawyers and officials in West Africa, who are on a par with well-educated white men, and in some cases superior in intelligence and acquirements to the whites with whom they come in contact. It is absurd, however, to regard the Negro race, as a whole, on the same average level as the European—they are far below us. Take them in their native wilds, and they are what we were before Julius Caesar landed in this country; indeed, in many cases they are not 2,000 years behind us, but 10,000. They are in the condition of some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and Gaul, and Spain, whose history we can dimly spell out from their implements and scattered remains, who were undoubtedly cannibals and probably naked, and leading a brutish life. Yet we can in a few years drag them from the condition that prevailed 2,000 years before Christ into the year of grace 1889. We can take a cannibal from the Upper Cross River, and transport him to the centres of civilisation in England or America, where everything represents the utmost result of our present development; but what will be usually the result both with the individual and the race? The savage mind will be unable to grasp and assimilate one-third of the wonders presented to his consideration, and will probably even suffer from the shock. We cannot expect the negroes of West Africa to become all at once intelligent, self-governing people. For many years the white races must be their guardians and educators, and we must educate the negro by force if necessary, leaving him to understand us afterwards, when we have raised him to a condition to do so. This, then, is our mission in West Africa: to instruct the natives that idleness is the eighth deadly sin; next, to so instruct the native as to the existence of the resources of this country; and, lastly, to educate him in the principles of civilised society, and so assimilate his views with our own that he and we may be bound together with the ties of commerce and Empire.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'A CALL TO ACTION IN CENTRAL AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The value of Lancashire mill property has decreased one-half during the last three years.

The industrial redemption of Africa, the bringing its large interior population into beneficial and permanent relation with European civilization, is a work worthy of the highest ambition to undertake and to accomplish.

The fact is that generations must pass before the country can be properly developed. We are not dealing with a country in which there are accumulated wealth, acquired habits of industry, and a knowledge of art, but with peoples who are absolutely ignorant. There is potential wealth in the land, but it must be cultivated. At present no trade is done except in forest products.

Indigo will be one of these, and Africa will become one of the great indigo-producing countries of the world.

Where the population was only sparse, that might be accounted for by the tribal warfare which prevailed, and which could be suppressed by the introduction of civilisation. What was wanted was that peace should be maintained, and trade encouraged, to raise the natives to a civilised condition. The native population was divisible into three great classes—the Arab, the Negroid, and the Negro. The Arab race they met from the Nile to the Zambesi, and in the Sahara, as well as about the Great Lakes. They were the merchants and the traders, while the Negroids were the occupiers and cultivators of the soil. It was singular that, while the Arab race had endeavoured to oust the British from the Soudan, they had assisted them at Zanzibar. It was difficult to deal with them, and it would not do to drive them out as the Moors had been driven from Spain. The best thing to do would be to make them useful in Central Africa, to deal with them as we found them, and to place in their way such commercial prospects that they might be induced to abandon the slave trade. If they once got the Arab to join them, they could easily put a stop to the butcheries of the negro races by each other. As to the Negroids, they were being gradually absorbed by the other two races. The most important race to the British Empire was the Negro, who was capable of being rapidly civilised. He could not raise himself unaided, and he still remained as he had been limned 4,000 years ago upon the Egyptian frescoes. Yet as soon as he was brought into contact with civilisation he took it up rapidly, and soon became a good clerk, an engineer, a cook, or domestic servant. The Negro was far less alien to our civilisation than the Chinaman, and in the course of about 300 years there would be very little difference between him and the European except the colour of the skin. They might be weaned from slave-dealing, man-hunting, the burning of witches, and the offering of human sacrifices, and he did not know of any African prince who could be accused of anything like the beheadings and the quarterings that took place in the reigns of Henry VIII., Mary, and Elizabeth, nor did he find that any native African priesthood had been guilty of one-tenth of the horrible cruelty which had been perpetrated in Europe under the name of religion. In conclusion, he observed that if these portions of Africa with which he has been dealing could but be brought under the influence indicated, it would bring them an increase of knowledge, of wealth, and of power such as had accrued to them from their dominions in Asia.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-11-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/07_11_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'If we have not parted with the energy and resolution which, as a Government and people, have characterised us of old, if we shall frame and carry out a sensible, settled policy in these regions, yielding to no sentimental clamour from false philanthropists, nor ignoring the just rights of the natives and our responsibility towards them as their guardians and instructors, we shall make of Western Africa another India, equally worthy of renown and equally profitable to our trade.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Proposed French and English Exchange of West African Settlements', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Irrespective of Imperial considerations and views, and of the questions of West African development and civilization involved in the matter of the proposed exchange of British and French settlements in West Africa, there must necessarily be particular and personal interests that would be affected by such changes of rule and system as are involved in the proposed measure, should it be carried into effect. These particular and personal interests have grown up under British rule in the Gambia, and are the only ones on the West Coast of any importance that would be jeopardized or interfered with by the contemplated transfers. The British free trade policy, which has opened the ports of all our settlements and colonies to foreign commerce, differs so essentially from the French protective system, under which, as at the Senegal, for instance, all possible British competition is prohibited, that the British merchants having establishments on the River Gambia—establishments, some of which were founded more than half a century ago—are very naturally apprehensive that in coming under the restrictive French colonial system, instead of the liberal British one, their interests will be seriously jeopardized; or, in brief, that they would very soon be driven out altogether from the Gambia as a French colony or settlement. We cannot say that these apprehensions are unfounded, and we have therefore not been at all surprised to find that the British merchants having establishments on the Gambia have been holding private meetings in London, during the past month, for mutual counsel and agreement as to the best course for them to pursue for their own protection in this emergency. We sympathize with them, and do not hesitate to say that it would be unjust on the part of Her Majesty’s Government to make the proposed exchange without some stipulation that shall protect their absolute interest. As we are strangers to their counsels, we have not heard what is their estimate of these interests, or what special course of action they may have decided to adopt in defence of them. We have, however, a very decided opinion of our own in the matter, and that opinion we shall unreservedly express. First, then, we think they will be very unwise if they adopt the course of opposition to the Imperial policy in this matter, either on Imperial grounds or on the grounds of any supposed rights that the Native populations in the Gambia may have to a continuance of British rule in their countries. These are questions with which as British merchants they have not any concern. Like all other British subjects, they may express fully and freely their opinions respecting them, but they will not be wise if they do more. Their opposition to the Imperial policy would necessarily have little or no weight, because it could not be separated from, but would infallibly be regarded as influenced by, personal considerations. We helped them in 1869-70 to fight the battle against the transfer of the Gambia to the French, on Imperial grounds, because the transfer, as then proposed, was motived by considerations unworthy of such an empire as that of Great Britain, and certain to bring upon her an enduring disgrace. The motives of Government action are, however, at the present time essentially different. It is no longer a question whether ten or twenty thousand pounds a-year can be saved to the Imperial exchequer by getting rid of the Gambia. That economy was made without getting rid of it. We cannot, therefore, as we stated last month, fight the battle over again on such grounds, because they no longer exist. The considerations that influence us ought also to influence the Gambia merchants on this point. We insist the more on this because we have heard that merchants not connected with the Gambia trade have been active in tendering their co-operation and support to the Gambia merchants in opposing the Government on these Imperial grounds. They have real or fancied interests of their own involved, no doubt, in the projected exchange of settlements; but their interests are not in any respect the interests of the Gambia merchants, who will do wisely to leave them to pull their own chestnuts out of the fire, if they have any that seem likely to be burned there; and decline the proffered aid which, if accepted, will weaken instead of strengthen their position. Their true policy seems to us very clear. It is that they should not oppose the Government views, which are supposed to be now based on Imperial considerations of sufficient weight to justify the Government in entertaining them. Their acquiescence or non-acquiescence will not eventually influence the Government decision. What they have a just right to ask, and should energetically and persistently ask, is that they should not be sacrificed to those Imperial considerations which may justify Her Majesty’s Government in exchanging the Gambia for the relinquishment by the French in favour of Great Britain of their settlements and interests on all other parts of the West Coast of Africa. The Gambia merchants have invested large sums in buildings and other immovable property, in the belief, which they were in every respect justified in entertaining, that the British settlement on the Gambia was a permanent one. The giving up by Great Britain of any settlement it has once formed is an event so extremely rare that there could not be any possible reason why the future cession of the Gambia to some other Power should have been at all contemplated or considered by them. There is not anything therefore in their position at the Gambia to diminish the force and justice of their claim, that in any arrangements made by the British Government with that of the French for the cession of the Gambia to the latter, their interests should be scrupulously guarded and preserved to the fullest extent of their pecuniary value. We have no doubt it is tolerably correct that it would be impossible for them to live and continue their trade at the Gambia as hitherto, when French authorities and laws shall have superseded those under whom and which they have hitherto lived and carried on their commerce. The cession of the Gambia to the French involves therefore their eventual ejection from the settlement. If they remain there striving against the new and adverse circumstances after the cession, and those circumstances act so prejudicially to their interests as they seem to us to be fully justified in believing that they will act, they might be forced into parting with their properties to French merchants at almost any price that the latter might choose to give. They are justified therefore in demanding of Her Majesty’s Government that they shall not be subject to any such contingency, but be so placed under the new rule and laws that, should the prejudicial results which they fear really follow, they may be able at any time to leave the Gambia and receive the full present value of their properties. It is not necessary for us to point out to such practical men as they are how this might be arranged for without any actual loss or burthen to the French Government. It might certainly be so arranged that should the change result adversely to them they shall receive the full present value of their properties; while at the same time they should be left free to realize as much more for these as they might be enabled to obtain.

The testimony to the entire discontinuance of the slave-trade, under any name or pretext, by France, has been general and convincing. On slave-trade suppression grounds there would now consequently be no loss by the substitution of French for British rule in the Gambia. If, therefore, because of economical considerations—because of the poverty of its exchequer, Great Britain declines to exercise such jurisdiction over the river and the natives along its banks, from the sea to M\'Carthy\'s Island, as will as effectually repress violence, robbery, and war, stimulate production and commerce, and aid voluntary efforts for the dissemination of Christianity, we see no justification in her retaining the Gambia, provided the French Government will consent to acquire it on reasonable terms, and under such stipulations for entire freedom of trade, and protection to Christian missions, as we feel convinced the enlightened Emperor of the French would willingly agree to. Possessing both the Senegal and the Gambia, and having already a preponderating influence in the neighbouring rivers south of the latter, and supposed to be in their upper portions in near proximity to it, as the Senegal is to the northward, the French Government, which, fortunately for African civilization, still possesses sufficient pecuniary resources to enable her to expend a few thousands a-year for bringing the over-warring natives under a peaceful restraint, as the only foundation for future enlarged production, commerce, and civilization, might, in a short time, succeed in giving a new aspect to regions whose fertility is beyond dispute, and which possess an adequate population inclined to agricultural pursuits.\n\nFor British reasons we should indeed deeply—deeply deplore such a cession of the Gambia to France. To retire from British territory in any part of the world is a serious thing; but if we are to abandon every noble, Christian, and humanitarian, as well as commercial aspiration at the dictum of a miserable economy, our country would only be dishonoured by a longer stay at the Gambia.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

In 1886, the British administration was also able to convince Ibadan and the Ekitiparapo (comprising the Ekiti, Ijesha and Egba), who had been at war since 1879, to sign a peace treaty. That the British had accomplished so much in Yorubaland by 1886 should not surprise us. Apart from the activities of the European traders and missionaries, which had preceded the wars, after fighting among themselves since the 1850s, the Yoruba were themselves war-weary and needed peace; hence their acceptance of the intervention by the British. The only state in Yorubaland that had effectively resisted the missionaries, the British traders, and the Lagos administration, until the 1880s was Ijebu. Bent on occupying Yorubaland from the early 1890s, the British decided to teach Ijebu a lesson and at the same time demonstrate to the remaining Yoruba states the futility of opposing them.$^{46}$ Using an alleged insult to Governor Denton in 1892 as a pretext, the British launched a wellprepared expedition of about 1000 men armed with rifles, machine guns and a Maxim gun. The Ijebu courageously raised an army of between 7000 and 10000 men but in spite of this huge numerical superiority and in spite of the fact that some of them were armed with firearms, they were routed by the invaders.$^{47}$ It would appear that all the remaining Yoruba states learnt a lesson from this invasion, and it is not surprising that between 1893 and 1899 Abeokuta, Ibadan, Ekiti-Ijesa and Oyo readily agreed to negotiate treaties and accepted British residents.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

There is no doubt that taking advantage of the peace and order as well as the patronage and in some areas the positive encouragement provided by colonialism, Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics pushed their activities further and further inland. As K. Asare Opoku has shown (Chapter 20), Christianity and Islam gained far more ground during the colonial period than had been the case during the previous three or four centuries put together. It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony.

Many decades of British efforts to discover the course and sources of the Niger river were crowned with success when Richard and John Lander were brought from Aboh to Nembe (Brass) by its ruler, King Boy Amain, in 1830. Once the estuaries of the many rivers of the Niger delta were shown to be the entrance to the great Niger river, British interest was greatly increased in the area as a highway into the rich interior of Nigeria and West Africa. British traders, such as Macgregor Laird, as well as humanitarians and missionaries tried to move up the delta into the hinterland between the 1830s and 1850s.\nIn the eastern delta itself, the Church Missionary Society under the leadership of the Nigerian ex-slave, Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther, estab› lished missions at Bonny in 1864, at Twon-Brass in the Nembe kingdom in 1868, at Elem Kalahari (New Calabar in the documents) in 1874, and at Okrika in 1880. Both at Bonny and Nembe, the rulers invited the missionaries for a number of reasons. Some wished to have the missionaries establish schools in which their children could learn to read, write and speak English in order to carry on their commercial relations with British firms. It was also believed that permission for the missionaries would lead to better relations with the British government, represented by the consuls and naval officers, and serve to strengthen them against neighbouring states in internal power struggles. These same reasons sometimes led to the missionaries being rejected in other parts of the eastern delta. Thus, once the Church Missionary Society was established at Bonny, Jaja of Opobo, who had broken away from Bonny in 1869 to form his state of Opobo, would have nothing to do with that mission. The establishment of Christian missions was, however, resisted by powerful interests within each of the delta states, and Christianity constituted a factor of social instability in the nineteenth century.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858.

This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889.

Similarly, Oyo cultural influences found in eastern Yorubaland - worship of Sango, the spread of the men's loom, shoulder sling drums - must be considered not so much as evidence of Oyo hegemony before 1800 as of the nineteenth-century diaspora of the Oyo following the fall of the empire. 38 A similar influence from Benin, especially on court ceremonials, regalia and chieftaincy titles in Qwo, Ekiti, Akoko, Ondo, Ijesa - as among the Awori astride the present-day Nigeria-Benin border - showed the widespread effect of the theme of inter-group penetration and com› mensurate institutional adaptation.

They tried to exercise some influence through the trusts or credits they gave to Efik traders; and sometimes used economic sanctions by collectively suspending trade with any defaulting Efik merchant.

Sierra Leone became their training ground. In addition to spreading Christianity and civilization the missions had to fight the slave trade, especially at Rio Pongos. But local slave-traders suspected these people of spying for the colonial government: they set fire to buildings of the Church Missionary Society who abandoned the field. In the colony itself, where political authority was conscious of its humanitarian mission, the missionaries were not unconscious of politics.

Colonialism superimposed on the pre-existing class structure of the continent at least an extra layer of leaders and pacesetters. In East Africa where it encouraged Asian immigration, colonialism in fact superimposed two classes. In each colony Europeans had the monopoly of political, economic and educational power, except in East Africa where a fraction of the economic power fell into the hands of Asians. In this situation the Africans became the underprivileged and looked up to the Europeans, and at times to the Asians, for leadership and example.\nThis structure of social relationship was shored up with a bogus racial theory which sought to arrange the different branches of the human family in a hierarchical order of civilization with the Africans (the Negroes) occupying the bottom of the ladder while the Europeans (whites) occupied the top. In Southern Africa, in particular, where white settlers found themselves locked in conflict with numerically superior Bantu peoples, the racial theory was especially stringent, with the authority of the Holy Bible being wrongly used to reinforce the presumed social implications of pseudo-Darwinism.

If, as stated, the only desire of the Ibadans is to procure constant and abundant supplies of arms and ammunition, not for self-defence, but for wars of aggression and conquest, and with the fixed intention and hope of ultimately destroying Abeokuta; we think it should be a matter for serious consideration by the British authorities at Lagos, whether in the interests, not only of Lagos as the great seaport of those countries, but in the also of the whole population of the Egba and Yoruba territories, they should not adopt a decided policy for the maintenance of peace, and make that policy known to all the parties interested. Lagos cannot be advantaged in any way by the destruction of the Egbas by the Ibadans. Every attack by the Ibadans on the Egba farms is an attack on the prosperity of Lagos. It seems to us, therefore, that the time has come when the Government at Lagos should notify to the chiefs and people at Ibadan that all unprovoked attacks by the latter on the Egba farms; and all attempts against the territorial integrity of Abeokuta, will be not only displeasing to the government at Lagos, but will, if persisted in, be at length regarded as acts of hostility against Lagos itself; that in an unprovoked war of aggression by Ibadan upon Abeokuta, the latter would, in case of necessity, be assisted by Her Majesty\'s Government at Lagos. It is surely time that the Queen\'s Government at Lagos should exercise its just influence in interior disputes that so gravely compromise those commercial interests on the prosperity of which that of Lagos itself depends. The key-note of civilization, peace, and prosperity in those countries must be sounded from Lagos; and it is not worthy in a Government carried on there in the name of the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, that this key-note should be only so faintly struck as to be, as it has hitherto been, scarcely audible. That Government must adopt a policy distinct, stable, enlightened, and understood by the interior peoples. We do not see any secure basis on which such a policy can be founded and built up, but that of peace, friendship, and goodwill with and towards Abeokuta, and the promise of efficient aid to the latter, if necessary, in the event of unprovoked attack from Ibadan. Her Majesty\'s Government has remonstrated with the King of Dahomey as regards his oft-repeated attacks upon Abeokuta, one at least of which would seem to have been made by direct invitation of Ibadan; and it will only be a carrying out of the same policy to make similar remonstrances with the latter. If there be a perfectly friendly understanding with Abeokuta on the part of the Lagos government, with a frank declaration of such a policy as we have pointed to, we cannot believe that there would be any difficulty in arranging the question of transit dues between Abeokuta and Ibadan. If, as asserted, the objection on the part of the Egbas to force intercourse on the part of the Yorubas with Lagos, is one derived from the natural instinct of self-preservation, that objection will disappear when once Abeokuta becomes assured that, let Ibadan import whatever quantity of arms and ammunition she may, she will not be permitted to use them for despoiling and destroying Abeokuta. We should then also hope to see a perfect and entire accord between the Lagos Government and the Egba authorities for improving the land communications of Abeokuta with Lagos. The distance between the two places ought to be accomplished within the short space of a few hours, both for passengers and goods. Then, and never until then, will the Egba countries make that progress which such fertile countries, inhabited by so industrial a population, ought to make. All our views, aims, and desires concerning them, since Lagos became a possession of the British Crown, have been in this direction; and we yet hope to see them realized. It will appear at once, to all who are interested in the discussion and settlement of matters so vital as regards the commercial prosperity of Lagos, that the Porto Novo Question cannot be overlooked. It is time it was settled in the way desired by the enlightened portion of the Lagos community, native and European. The supplies of ammunition which enabled the Ibadans to commence their late raids in Abeokuta territory—raids, which we rejoice to hear, have, in many instances, been vigorously repulsed—were obtained from Porto Novo by a large armed body of Ibadans, who, either with the connivance, or because of the small power of resistance of the king of that place, plundered the stores of English and other merchants of all that they chose to require. The present efforts of the Ibadans to make a road of their own through Egba territory to Porto Novo, are efforts to enable them to repeat that plundering operation whenever their marauding necessities may require fresh supplies. We showed, some months ago, in a leading article in our journal, how indispensable it had now become that Porto Novo should be united with Lagos under British government; and the conviction then expressed could only be confirmed by the fact of the persistent attacks of the Ibadans on Egba farms lying on the line of their coveted road to Porto Novo. They would no longer have the same object in making, or desiring to make this road if Porto Novo and Lagos were under the same rule—a rule which has both the will and the power to prevent such depredations as those committed by the Ibadans in Porto Novo. We cannot doubt that the annexation of Porto Novo by amicable contract and arrangement with the Native authority of that place is under the consideration of Her Majesty\'s Government, who must feel the same desire that we do, that the enormities there practised should be put an end to, as well as that British property there should be freed from its present proved liability to plunder. Having ""put their hand to the plough"" in the annexation of Lagos, which, notwithstanding the occasional errors of its local government, has put an end to very great evils, and brought in a very great amount of good, they ought not now to draw back or hesitate when, as in the matter of Porto Novo, the need is so pressing, and the interests of humanity and civilizing commerce alike demand their immediate action.'}, {'id': 6304, 'article_title': 'Leader', 'full_section_title': 'Leader', 'last_edit_date': '02-01-1893', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1893#article-6', 'issue_date': '01_02_1893', 'content': 'WE ARE MOST PLEASED to be able to record that the difficulties between the British Government and the Egbas, which, during the past year or so have been the fruitful source of all manner of trouble to the commercial prosperity of Lagos, seem at last to have received a satisfactory solution.

That town must be Abeokuta; that power must be the power of authorities and people concentrated at Abeokuta. Possessed by these views and feelings, from which we have never deviated through all the troubles and disputes between Abeokuta and Lagos, and between the Egba and British authorities in these two places—troubles and disputes originating in mutual misconception, and fostered by interested malevolence and individual ambitions, interests, and hatreds—we have waited patiently until the storms of passion and the vapours of distrust should pass away. We hope and believe that these have now ever passed away. We learn with a satisfaction which it is not possible for us to find words adequately to describe, that the long conflicting interests in Abeokuta have now become reconciled, and that one generally recognized authority is now acknowledged there. This is a most important step in the right direction for assisting in the realization of our plans for the good of Abeokuta and its industrious, persevering people. We want Abeokuta to become strong—so defensively, not offensively, strong that no kingdom, or tribe, or people, or state shall dare to attack or seek to injure her or her people. We want absolute security for the Egba farms, that the labourer may work in full and entire confidence that he shall enjoy the fruit of his labours. Although the British Government has been hitherto powerless—simply because they have not taken up the matter in earnest—to put an end to the abominations of Dahomey, their energetic representations to its King that they would consider any further invasion of the Egba territory by him or by his army as a direct offence to themselves, has served to secure Abeokuta and its farms and villages from those raids which were almost annually repeated, and which occasioned the loss of so many lives and the destruction of so much property on Egba lands. But it is time that Abeokuta, distant only sixty or seventy miles from Lagos, should become so strong that she may command immunity from attack, whether from Dahomey or any other quarter, not merely by the good offices of the friendly British Government, though these must always be of importance to her, but by her own power and strength. That she may acquire fully that power and strength, she must be no longer isolated, as at present, but brought into territorial alliance and ready intercourse with Lagos by means of improved land communication between the two towns. To secure for Abeokuta all the advantages she needs and is entitled to, that improved land communication must be by a railway from Gaiun to Abeokuta. Every reduction of even one hour in the duration of journey between Lagos and Abeokuta is an added strength to the Egba capital. How greatly, then, will Abeokuta be strengthened when the journey between it and Lagos, the conveyance of produce, passengers, and goods, shall be reduced to four or five hours only! It is not easy to realize in one's mind the immense advantage that will accrue to Abeokuta and to the whole Egba and Yoruba countries by the establishment of such ready means of access between Abeokuta and Lagos. There must, however, now be educated Africans in Abeokuta who can so far realize the advantages in their minds as to enable them to show and explain and to convince the native authorities and people in Abeokuta of those advantages. As regards Lagos, we can scarcely conceive the necessity of effort to convince any one there. Lagos can only become a grand, rich town by large and prosperous trade; and every increased facility of transit in the interior, and from the interior to Lagos, every additional security to farming and other industrial operations at and around Abeokuta, which serves to increase the supply of exportable produce to Lagos and the consequent demand for British manufactured and other goods, becomes necessarily a factor in future Lagos grandeur, prosperity, and wealth. We do not, therefore, think it necessary to write one word to excite enthusiasm among the people of Lagos respecting and in favour of a proposed railway between Gaiun and Abeokuta. If they wish an increase of wealth-bestowing commerce and trade, they ought to strain every nerve to help us in our arduous effort to obtain for the people of Abeokuta that means of ready access for themselves and their produce with Lagos. On the score of increased health alone for the people of the interior and Lagos, both of which would be equally benefited in this important matter, rapid communication between Abeokuta and Lagos is so desirable, that every thinking man ought to be ready to make considerable sacrifices, if necessary, to secure the advantage. When our mind dwells on the subject of the proposed road and its beneficial influences, the prospect opening before us is so pleasing and so grand, that we cannot help deploring the time did not sooner arrive for this onward step, so that we might hope to live to record the interesting and wonderful results. We see Abeokuta in immediate communication with Lagos, with railway working, and steamboat service from Gaiun so improved as to reduce the journey to three hours. We see the heavily laden trains of produce, goods, and passengers passing between the two places. We see Abeokuta so strong and wealthy through that communication and constant friendly alliance with Lagos, that Ibadan and every populous town throughout Yoruba are begging of Abeokuta's rich men to help them with money to make roads from their towns to Abeokuta, so that their people may bring their produce to it, and go down themselves to Lagos and behold the sea. We see produce and people pouring into Abeokuta from Rabba, and even from Kano and Kooka; Abeokuta having become the great emporium to which all the produce of interior and surrounding countries comes, to be exchanged there for the European and other goods and manufactures brought also there to be exchanged for that produce. All these, and other greater results, we see in our mind accruing to Abeokuta as the result of that short line of railway which we now propose to have constructed between Gaiun and Abeokuta. It will not, therefore, be matter for surprise that, with our deep and ardent desire for progress in Africa, and the happiness and well-being of its people, we should have determined to make every possible effort for introducing this wonder-working agent of advanced civilization into the Egba country. There is not any realized wealth in Abeokuta that could be made available by its government and people toward the construction of the proposed road. We must present this great work to them; trusting for our pecuniary repayment to what profits the conveyance of passengers and goods over it may yield to us after payment of working expenses and a contribution to a fund for the ultimate repayment of capital. We have not, however, any anxiety as to the prospects of subscribers. A road from such a place as Lagos to such a place as Abeokuta—with a large population at each extremity and around the interior terminus— in a country where the people are so given to industry that enormous quantities of produce may be safely calculated upon, cannot fail to give adequate returns to investors, who will certainly benefit themselves while conferring incalculable advantages upon a most interesting people—a nation composed of the united remnants of many formerly very large tribes, the great masses of which perished in the wars provoked by the foreign slave-traders who were in search of victims at Lagos, or shipped thence (with exception of the many poor exhausted wretches who served as food for the great shoals of sharks in the Lagos waters) as slaves for the supply of the plantations in Jamaica, Demerara, Porto Rico, Cuba, the United States, and Brazil. If we recall the memory of those sad times, so disgraceful to Christian Europe, it is that we acknowledge an obligation on the part of all Christian people in England to help forward every good work in countries which but too many, alas! of our fellow-countrymen, or the fellow-countrymen of our forefathers, helped to depopulate and ruin by active participation in the unspeakable abomination of a foreign African slave-trade.

If, as stated, the only desire of the Ibadans is to procure constant and abundant supplies of arms and ammunition, not for self-defence, but for wars of aggression and conquest, and with the fixed intention and hope of ultimately destroying Abeokuta; we think it should be a matter for serious consideration by the British authorities at Lagos, whether in the interests, not only of Lagos as the great seaport of those countries, but in the also of the whole population of the Egba and Yoruba territories, they should not adopt a decided policy for the maintenance of peace, and make that policy known to all the parties interested. Lagos cannot be advantaged in any way by the destruction of the Egbas by the Ibadans. Every attack by the Ibadans on the Egba farms is an attack on the prosperity of Lagos. It seems to us, therefore, that the time has come when the Government at Lagos should notify to the chiefs and people at Ibadan that all unprovoked attacks by the latter on the Egba farms; and all attempts against the territorial integrity of Abeokuta, will be not only displeasing to the government at Lagos, but will, if persisted in, be at length regarded as acts of hostility against Lagos itself; that in an unprovoked war of aggression by Ibadan upon Abeokuta, the latter would, in case of necessity, be assisted by Her Majesty\'s Government at Lagos. It is surely time that the Queen\'s Government at Lagos should exercise its just influence in interior disputes that so gravely compromise those commercial interests on the prosperity of which that of Lagos itself depends. The key-note of civilization, peace, and prosperity in those countries must be sounded from Lagos; and it is not worthy in a Government carried on there in the name of the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, that this key-note should be only so faintly struck as to be, as it has hitherto been, scarcely audible. That Government must adopt a policy distinct, stable, enlightened, and understood by the interior peoples. We do not see any secure basis on which such a policy can be founded and built up, but that of peace, friendship, and goodwill with and towards Abeokuta, and the promise of efficient aid to the latter, if necessary, in the event of unprovoked attack from Ibadan. Her Majesty\'s Government has remonstrated with the King of Dahomey as regards his oft-repeated attacks upon Abeokuta, one at least of which would seem to have been made by direct invitation of Ibadan; and it will only be a carrying out of the same policy to make similar remonstrances with the latter. If there be a perfectly friendly understanding with Abeokuta on the part of the Lagos government, with a frank declaration of such a policy as we have pointed to, we cannot believe that there would be any difficulty in arranging the question of transit dues between Abeokuta and Ibadan. If, as asserted, the objection on the part of the Egbas to force intercourse on the part of the Yorubas with Lagos, is one derived from the natural instinct of self-preservation, that objection will disappear when once Abeokuta becomes assured that, let Ibadan import whatever quantity of arms and ammunition she may, she will not be permitted to use them for despoiling and destroying Abeokuta. We should then also hope to see a perfect and entire accord between the Lagos Government and the Egba authorities for improving the land communications of Abeokuta with Lagos. The distance between the two places ought to be accomplished within the short space of a few hours, both for passengers and goods. Then, and never until then, will the Egba countries make that progress which such fertile countries, inhabited by so industrial a population, ought to make. All our views, aims, and desires concerning them, since Lagos became a possession of the British Crown, have been in this direction; and we yet hope to see them realized. It will appear at once, to all who are interested in the discussion and settlement of matters so vital as regards the commercial prosperity of Lagos, that the Porto Novo Question cannot be overlooked. It is time it was settled in the way desired by the enlightened portion of the Lagos community, native and European. The supplies of ammunition which enabled the Ibadans to commence their late raids in Abeokuta territory—raids, which we rejoice to hear, have, in many instances, been vigorously repulsed—were obtained from Porto Novo by a large armed body of Ibadans, who, either with the connivance, or because of the small power of resistance of the king of that place, plundered the stores of English and other merchants of all that they chose to require. The present efforts of the Ibadans to make a road of their own through Egba territory to Porto Novo, are efforts to enable them to repeat that plundering operation whenever their marauding necessities may require fresh supplies. We showed, some months ago, in a leading article in our journal, how indispensable it had now become that Porto Novo should be united with Lagos under British government; and the conviction then expressed could only be confirmed by the fact of the persistent attacks of the Ibadans on Egba farms lying on the line of their coveted road to Porto Novo. They would no longer have the same object in making, or desiring to make this road if Porto Novo and Lagos were under the same rule—a rule which has both the will and the power to prevent such depredations as those committed by the Ibadans in Porto Novo. We cannot doubt that the annexation of Porto Novo by amicable contract and arrangement with the Native authority of that place is under the consideration of Her Majesty\'s Government, who must feel the same desire that we do, that the enormities there practised should be put an end to, as well as that British property there should be freed from its present proved liability to plunder. Having ""put their hand to the plough"" in the annexation of Lagos, which, notwithstanding the occasional errors of its local government, has put an end to very great evils, and brought in a very great amount of good, they ought not now to draw back or hesitate when, as in the matter of Porto Novo, the need is so pressing, and the interests of humanity and civilizing commerce alike demand their immediate action.', 'last_edit_date': '1878-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1878#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LAGOS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Events have been progressing favourably here. Those who have suffered so greatly from the loss of trade during the past two years have had ""consolations"" of late. We cannot say that friendly relations with the Abeokutans are yet re-established, though there seems great reason to believe they soon will be. But the produce that has poured into Lagos since the siege of Ikorodu was raised and the Ibadan road was opened has fully justified all the expectations formed by those who advocated the establishment of a British colony at Lagos on the ground that it would lead to its becoming, in the course of a few years, a grand emporium for the whole of the Yoruba countries. When trading relations shall be again restored with Abeokuta, those who have most condemned the efforts of the friends of material advancement and civilisation in Africa, who advocated the extension and increase of British power and influence at certain points on the Coast, will find that we were right and they were wrong, and that we were working for their profit while seeking the good of Africa.\n\nAnd this entire re-establishment of trading relations with Abeokuta seems to have been at hand when the last mail left that place for England. Early in the month of July, it was known in Lagos that the Governor, Captain Glover, had offered certain definite terms of arrangement to the Egbas. These terms included—\n\nThe allowing of all British property in Abeokuta to come down to Lagos; settling by commissioners the amount to be paid by the Egbas for the robberies and murders which had been committed on the river; the opening of the roads to traffic when a portion of this debt should have been paid; that goods going up in future from Lagos should be without British protection—all goods having to be bought by the Egbas in or near Lagos—so that the interior traffic and commerce of the country should be in their own hands; that no British merchants or their agents should reside as traders in Abeokuta; that coloured British subjects so residing there for trade should while so doing be considered as Egbas; and that such agreement should be in force until more regular treaties of peace and intercourse should be signed, guaranteeing the road from Ibadan to Lagos through Ikorodu; that they would remain in peace with their neighbours, &c., &c.\n\nThese terms, we learn from official sources, as well as by a supplement for the mail issued by the editor of the *Anglo-African* at Lagos, had been partially accepted by the Egbas—indeed, almost altogether accepted; the only difficulty with the Abeokutans seeming to be that they could not in justice to the merchants, who had come among them in good faith, require them to leave so long as they did not commit any offence, and showed a due respect for their laws.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-07-09', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1865#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'GOVERNMENT OF ABEOKUTA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""which nations cannot undertake the works indispensable to material development, were it not that wasteful heathen customs still throw their impoverishing shade over them, undoing frequently in a month or two all that it has taken some persistent individual a whole lifetime to accomplish. In our last we gave important news from Abeokuta—important, at least, as regards the great Egba nation and the neighbouring British settlement of Lagos. We announce the death of the Bashorun of the town, the man who had for some years, in default of a king, exercised the chief power there. For seventeen years he had been in this position, to which he had risen by daring and energy, but the influence of old age had of late years made itself injuriously felt in his character, causing him to become vacillating and unstable, and enfeebling his mind and arm for government. This ought not to astonish anyone when we record his age. He was ninety-three years old when death removed him from among his people. If he had been only sixty-three instead of ninety-three, we should never have heard of such scenes as those enacted in October, 1867, when the Christian places of worship were pillaged, and missionaries who had laboured there during many years retired to Lagos. The death of the Bashorun is not, therefore, to be regarded as a calamity, for the Egbas, who will now again come under the rule of a king—Ayekon, of Ake, of whom report speaks as possessing qualities which inspire a reasonable hope that peace, prosperity, and industrial development will shed their blessings over the country subject to his authority, in the exercise of which he will be zealously assisted by the kings and chiefs forming the lately-constituted Egba Board of Management, which we may regard as a species of executive council of state, and which will, we hope, prove instrumental in establishing and consolidating institutions calculated to obtain for the Egbas internal tranquillity and external respect. Abeokuta, even in its comparative infancy, has proved an insurmountable barrier to the inroads and depredations of the Dahomans on that side of the country, as Ashantee has on the other; and we shall not be at all surprised if, in the course of a few years, such a people should no longer be content merely to resist and defeat the Dahomans when they invade their territory and come before the walls of their town, but, in a plan of enlightened self-defence, so bring the intermediate towns and peoples into voluntary obedience or friendly union, as to enable them to assume the offensive, break in pieces the already-enfeebled Dahoman power, which has wasted its strength in the bloodthirsty expeditions of its kings, and give something like assured peace to that naturally rich and fertile, but long oppressed and devastated portion of Africa. For all this it is necessary that there should be a true and lasting friendship between this people and the British settlement of Lagos. The British Government has entirely repudiated all desire of domination in that part of Africa. In Lagos, it can and will confer essential advantages upon Abeokuta and other Egba towns, and the Yoruba countries generally—the advantages of a secure and improved outlet for the products of the soil—the advantages of showing at its very door those improvements which civilisation introduces, and which tend so much toward the welfare, the happiness, and strength of a community—the advantages of having a wealthy neighbour able and willing to assist a rising, energetic people in its early and necessarily painful and suspicious efforts at consolidation, amelioration, and advancement. And as among the changes absolutely indispensable among the Egbas themselves to their progress and wealth, we hope that under a new and more enlightened government than they have hitherto enjoyed, their king and his assisting council may succeed in inducing them to abandon that impoverishing custom by which all that was the late property of the dead is dissipated in foolish ceremonies and debasing excesses, leaving his family and descendants stripped and penniless. Such, our correspondent, who informs us of the late Bashorun's death, seems to have believed would unhappily be the fate of the deceased ruler's property and family. The increasing influence of Christianity would put an end to such pernicious follies and excesses, and it is only by their being put an end to that Abeokuta can become really great and powerful, in presence of the reflex of European civilisation brought at Lagos to its very doors. In the welfare, therefore, of the Egbas as a nation, as well as in that of its individuals, as men and women who desire happiness here and eternal felicity hereafter, we hope and pray that the blessed and blessing Christian work which has been so happily begun may revive, be strengthened, and ere long entirely prevail among them."", 'last_edit_date': '1868-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1868#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Tribute to the African-Aid Society', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""And although a state of circumstances which never ought to have existed has temporarily affected the trade of Lagos, and causes losses that we deeply regret; still, the daily increasing value of the soil of Lagos, even under the disadvantage of such interruption of trade, shows how, resting on the immovable basis of England's power, civilization is advancing, with its accompanying results. There is stagnation of trade, but property which had value has increased in value fourfold; and much that was valueless has acquired, and is daily increasing in, value. Notwithstanding the errors and administrative excesses of governors unused to govern, a warm breath of civilization is floating out of Lagos upon the surrounding countries. The toils of civilization are upon them. With Lagos a British colony, they have no escape. Lagos is already undergoing a great change. With the disappearance of native thatched roofs, a great deal of native filth, and many native irregularities, has also taken compulsory leave. The Africans are an observant people. The Egbas, who have lent themselves more readily to missionary instruction than any other natives, will ere long desire to make their towns equal with renewed and embellished Lagos. Under encouragement from Lagos, roads from the interior, for the passage of persons and goods, will ere long be made. All that we regret is, that the territory of Lagos did not incontestibly extend to Aro, the place of embarkation on the river, three miles from Abeokuta. There is abundant territory for Abeokuta on the other side. This would have been a real blessing for Abeokuta. Supported by the immediate proximity of British authority, the native Christians would have obtained the supremacy, and progress would have been rapid. But though delayed, it must be entered upon. We are near enough to render that certain. Our African neighbours cannot isolate themselves, and cannot remain unprogressive, in the presence of our power at Lagos. Every step they make in progress will increase production and trade. And we feel convinced that, within a very short time, our Lagos friends who have condemned us for having, as they believe, exercised considerable influence in producing annexation, will rejoice with us that England has, in this instance, been true to her real mission, and snatched another land from the filth and darkness of heathen rule, to shed upon and from it the glorious light of her Christian civilization."", 'last_edit_date': '1863-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1863#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE YORUBA COUNTRIES', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have never ceased to assert that, although some trade may be done at points of the coast where there is no established British authority, the presence of a European and Christian civilization in power is indispensable to the advancement of native Africa. We seem to have a new and striking instance in support of this at Lagos, for the erection of which into a British colony we, among others, have been so much and so greatly condemned, not only by those whose mercantile operations were unfortunately rendered for a time less profitable, but by others who, though unsurpassed in their desires for the national, social, and religious improvement of the Africans, think that this could be effected solely by the influence of missionaries, in conjunction with the European commerce which may be carried on to some extent where they are present. A considerable trade was carried on at Lagos while it was under native rule and British protection. But that trade was really created by the latter; because until Great Britain had obtained the defending and nominally, controlling power there, Lagos had been one of the great seats of that foreign slave-trade the history of the active ravages of which in western Africa is now, we hope, nearly closed. But though legitimate trade of some considerable importance sprang up and was successfully carried on at Lagos under the new order of things, the influence of Lagos as a country was not on the side of Christian civilization. The presence of the representatives of the protecting power alone prevented the slave-trade, which continued to be carried on in driblets through Porto Novo and Badagry, from becoming rampant as before. Lagos, as a native power, being more or less at variance with the other native rule on the mainland shores of the Lagoon, had its chief commercial relations with the interior at Abeokuta, which there was facility of access by river; and its commerce was augmented by the palm oil trade of Porto Novo and Badagry. Abeokuta was the only bright spot in those dark parts of the world. Liberated slaves, natives of that country, educated and instructed in the rudiments of the Christian faith, returned there from Sierra Leone. European missionary establishments followed them; and, although paganism still ruled, it became gradually restrained in some of its great enormities by British influences thus introduced. But it was pagan at core, and fond of little wars wherein slaves might be taken for labour, enjoyment, or sale through Dahomey. In virtue, however, of its continuous friendly relations with Lagos—the natural shipping port for the whole of these countries—of the presence of a considerable missionary body, and of many active Sierra Leone traders in it, it became the emporium of the interior, and the great road of traffic passed through it. ""If you wish to make me happy get from between me and the sun,"" said the ancient Greek. ""Get from between me and the sea,"" is the continual cry of the interior of Africa to the populations intervening between it and the great waters. It was because they would not allow free access to the sea that the Dahomans fought and pressed forward until they destroyed all the peoples which barred their access to the coast, at Wydah and neighbouring ports. It is because the sea with all its contingent advantages is there, that Ashantee is the irreconcilable enemy of the Fantee tribes lying between it and Cape Coast. In the same way Abeokuta stood between the large populations of Yoruba and Lagos. As the only open road for Yoruban and the far interior produce had been through Abeokuta, with great advantage to the latter place, which desired to take toll of all that passed by it, the Abeokutans declared that it should be the only road, and determined to use all their power to maintain this, and gratify at the time their slave-acquiring propensities. With the establishment of British rule and authority in the colony of Lagos, all the petty rivalries and hatreds between Lagos and the mainland rulers on the Lagoons were doomed to disappear. The great town of Ibadan, with double the population of Abeokuta, which had sold produce and received supplies in driblets through Abeokuta, desired to have free access to Lagos and its important markets by the more direct road of Ikorodu. The authorities of Lagos saw their duty clearly in this matter. The present Lieutenant-Governor, Captain Glover, had a personal acquaintance with Yoruba and the Niger countries beyond, and was deeply penetrated with the enormous advantages that might accrue, not only commercially to Lagos, but as regards the development of resources and spread of Christian civilization in Yoruba, if its large populations could obtain and maintain a free road through Ikorodu to the Lagos lagoon. When the Egbas, therefore, after the retirement of the Ibadans in the late war, laid siege to Ikorodu, they were warned by the Governor of Lagos that unless they made themselves masters of it, and established their sovereignty over that part within a given time, they must abandon the enterprise. They did not make themselves masters—they were repulsed in every attempt, but they remained in force in an entrenched camp, and stopped the way. Notice was given them to retire—they mocked at it—they defied the power that requested their departure—and Minie rifles and Congreve rockets in disciplined hands were sent over from Lagos to teach them that Great Britain only advises and requires what she has power to enforce. The rifles and rockets did their appointed work. The road from Ibadan to Lagos, through Ikorodu, was permanently opened; and a lesson was taught—an important lesson, which may bring to that part of Africa results more beneficial than language can describe. They were taught that, since Great Britain is in Lagos, war in the adjacent countries cannot, and shall not, be carried on without her license and permission. We refer our readers to the intelligence under the head of Lagos. War—war—war—little wars for slaves, and for little objects—was the curse of those as of other portions of native Africa. And if these can be permanently put an end to, as we believe that through the influence of Lagos—British Lagos—they will, the great bar to the material development of the rich Egba and Yoruba countries will be removed, and a free access will be given to the propagation of Christianity, and to the influence of the example of civilization which Lagos, daily cleansing and improving, will present to every native trader from the interior who may visit its markets. We feel our old conviction that colonial Lagos would prove a mighty agent in the work of African regeneration was a just one, and that its influence is about to make itself most beneficially felt through the vast regions with respect to which it occupies so important a position.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.711, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ABEOKUTA AND LAGOS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The letter we have now published (p. 36) on ""What Caused the Heathen Uprising in Abeokuta on Sunday, October 13, 1867,"" brings the whole question of the unsettled and most unsatisfactory state of relations between Lagos and Abeokuta again prominently before us. The sale and gift of lands at Ebute Meta by the Lagos Government, constituting as this does an absolute claim and assumption of British authority over that portion of the main land, is a measure of such extreme importance as bearing upon the present and future relations between the British colony of Lagos and the native government of Abeokuta, that nothing short of the most imperious necessity, and the most indisputable and indefeasible claim, can possibly justify such proceedings. There is no portion of the West Coast at which the development of productive resources and the increase of commerce, may be so rapid as in the Abeokuta Territories (with Yoruba generally) and Lagos, provided there be a constantly good and friendly understanding and amicable relations between Lagos and Abeokuta. But for this it is essential that nothing should be done on the part of the Island Government to wound the just susceptibilities, or aggravate the unfortunate distrust of the Abeokutans, as regards British encroachment. The progress of Christian civilisation and material development in the Yoruba countries and primarily among the Aku people, and the increase of the trade of Lagos, are desired results necessarily bound up together and inseparably united. It is not for the permanent mercantile interests of Lagos that she should be mixed up with the wars and disputes of the interior, except as a great civilised pacificator—as the representative of British Christian civilisation acting for the amelioration of adjacent heathen lands. But if Lagos holds absolute possession on the main land, she can scarcely fail to be involved in such native wars and disputes; and it must be expected that questions will continually arise to disturb the friendly intercourse of Lagos with the interior. We regard this matter of the present and future relations of Lagos with the main-land people, and especially with Abeokuta, as one of such very great importance, that we feel it to be our duty to solicit for it the prompt and especial attention of the Governor-in-Chief. Among the gross neglects of duty of Governor Blackall we look upon his conduct as regards this important matter, as one of the most serious, and at the same time, most irritating to native susceptibilities and suspicions. We see with pleasure that the Governor of Lagos has been lately invited to Sierra Leone by the Governor-in-Chief; doubtless for those explanations as regards the Lagos Government which could scarcely be fully given without a personal interview; and as the facts, real or supposed, as viewed by the local Lagos Executive, and the views of that Executive, will now have been brought under the keen and impartial mental scrutiny of Sir Arthur Kennedy, we look forward with hope and confidence to some action of the Governor-in-Chief, that shall lead to a speedy placing of the relations of Lagos with Abeokuta, and *vice versa*, on a just and friendly footing, such as will tend to the permanent reciprocal advantage of the inhabitants of the British colony and of the adjacent native territories.', 'last_edit_date': '1868-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1868#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Dahoman Raid on Abeokuta', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'capital, in the latter,—we still look to the Egbas as a people endowed with natural gifts, which, if properly directed, could scarcely fail to make them mighty instruments in the spread of that Christian civilization in Africa, without which there can be no satisfactory progress there, no rising from the debasement produced by ages after ages of ignorance, and a childish and cruel superstition. Oh, that the true light would shine on those dark lands! Oh, that a nation should there be born in a day! This will, of course, follow the glorious second advent of the Great Messiah, the Crucified of Calvary, yet King of kings and Lord of lords; but we would fain have seen some small approach to it, some faint day-dawn glimmerings of it, in our own time. We hope for it even now, and hoping for, even as earnestly desiring it, our deep interest in the Egbas as a people is unimpaired. We do not regard it as a mere accident, that among the Africans delivered by British cruisers from the power of the foreign slave-trader, and subsequently introduced to the knowledge of the English language by education, and of Christianity by the teaching of zealous missionaries, the Akus should predominate in numbers; or that (so far as our knowledge on this point at present extends) they and the Eboes, their near neighbours in Western Africa, should have afforded superior evidence of the capability of the African to attain to and receive both secular and Christian enlightenment. We believe that God, in His providence, has so overruled events for special results; and shall not therefore be surprised to see some combined efforts, by these instruments thus specially prepared, for bringing such enlightenment to the native mind within the territories peopled by their race, as may prepare the way, among other things, to the adoption by the authorities of Abeokuta of those means of defence and security which the advanced civilization of Europe can and is ready to supply. The security of Abeokuta, its entire delivery from the cruel pest of Dahomey, ought to be an object near to the heart of all of them; and we often feel surprised that they have done so little hitherto, as a body, to bring their education, their enlightenment, their Christianity, to bear in an operatively beneficial way upon those of whom we have been writing. There are two objects that they ought to strive for, constantly and untiringly—and will so strive for, if their education and Christianity be worth anything—beyond those blessed individual influences on character and principle which ought to flow immediately from them. These two things are, the obtaining for Abeokuta, and the territory between it and Dahomey, that delivery and security without which nothing permanently beneficial can be hoped for; and the forming an easy and speedy land communication between Abeokuta and a point on the waters toward Lagos, to which the navigation is at all times open. These two things are intimately allied, for if such easy and rapid communication existed between Abeokuta and Lagos, it would be such an element of power to Abeokuta that the Dahomans would never thereafter think for a single moment of disturbing its industrial activity by their atrocious raids. We urge it as a duty upon all those who are connected with that country by ties of blood and birth, to employ combined as well as individual efforts for the accomplishment of this great end. Every one of those who have received the blessing of education ought to be an apostle of progress, and it will not be creditable to them should they still remain inert as regards great public objects, and only careful and enterprising in matters concerning their own personal advantage.', 'last_edit_date': '1875-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1875#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CHURCH TOWER AND CLOCK IN LAGOS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Influence to be exercised by it, that must produce incalculable blessings throughout those wide-spread territories, for the abundant production of which this once dark seat of a hideous slave trade, offers by its now well-filled port a ready and advantageous outlet. It is only ten years since this interesting little island was under native rule, and a sort of British protection, which had been afforded with the object of entirely suppressing the slave trade that was still a devastating agent in neighbouring countries. It was found, however, to be impossible to prevent this altogether, while the island should continue under native rule; some little slave trade was still secretly carried on with the native mainland; and as the actual ruler of the country was only so by reason of the efficacious protection afforded by a resident British agent, with British ships of war within call, it was wisely and humanely determined by the British Government, in which the power and influence of Lord Palmerston were then supreme, that the native King should retire upon a pension, and the settlement be made a British one. We were an ardent promoter of this change, and incurred great odium in consequence, among merchants who, under British protection, there carried on a successful trade without payment of the duties exacted where British authorities held sway; and among educated African traders, who but in too many cases abandoned in Lagos those restraints which Christian civilisation imposed on them in Sierra Leone. Lagos was then a filthy, pestiferous place, peculiarly fatal to Europeans. Ten years, only ten years, and what a change has been accomplished! At no other place in Africa has civilising progress been so rapid, or shown such irrepressible energy. Mistakes were made in the early days of British rule, which led for a time to an entire alienation of the powerful Egba nations on the mainland; eventuating in hostilities that for some time paralysed trade, and left bitter seeds of distrust in the native mind in Abeokuta and elsewhere. By a wiser policy, however, during the last four or five years, Administrator Glover has done much to redeem the past in that respect; abstaining from everything that could give rise to further distrust or suspicion. We are sorry sometimes to think that he never can obtain the confidence and goodwill of the Egba people; and that, in consequence, many works that would shed additional lustre upon his name, can never be effected by him. And here we think it well to take advantage of this opportunity to impress upon him the necessity, in the interests of Lagos, of not incautiously recommencing efforts such as for opening communication with Ibadan, &c., they may arouse anew the old hostile feelings, and that can only serve to retard the realisation of those useful objects which he no doubt has in view, but which we are persuaded the interior natives never can be brought to assent to and co-operate in, until Lagos shall possess an elected Legislative Council. When this right shall be accorded to her, the presence and influence of those educated African merchants and traders, civilised and Christian, which Lagos already has in no small number among her citizens, may and will enable the then Government of Lagos to overcome all suspicion and animosity, and to show Egbas, Ijebus, Ijeshas, and all concerned, that Lagos desires the introduction of such and such works among them, not from motives of ambition or lust of dominion, but for the mutual and reciprocal advancement of Lagos and the interior. That elected Legislative Council cannot be long denied to Lagos. Her progress is too rapid to permit of this. Her revenues, from duties on imports, are now, we believe, between 40,000l. and 50,000l. a-year. They will, no doubt, yearly increase. She has well-laid-out streets, presenting a striking contrast to the former agglomeration of the vilest class of African huts. Those streets are lighted. Sanitary improvements have made her a healthy place of residence, even for Europeans, if they will abstain from the indulgence of those destructive propensities which may be justly said to have dug by far the greater number of British graves along the West Coast. And having churches and chapels, which have been for the most part built by funds raised in Lagos itself, she is now making an effort for a church tower, with its public clock. We admire this public spirit among her educated African traders; and this particular manifestation of it has our warmest sympathy. We do not offer pecuniary aid; nor do we ask any one in England, unless he be a Lagos man absent for a time from his country, to give any aid. We are jealous for the reputation of Lagos. She is able now to do such works for her embellishment and convenience with her own money, and she will do it; and if the list of contributors be furnished to us when the necessary sum shall be all subscribed, we will immortalise them in our columns. Meanwhile we wish them heartily Godspeed; and we desire that those sincere friends of Africa who do exist in England, should take comfort in seeing what God has already wrought by the civilising and Christianising agencies of Great Britain, in a place where but a few years since the waters were daily defiled by the poor murdered victims of the brutal and abominable slave trade.', 'last_edit_date': '1871-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1871#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'OUR WEST AFRICAN RAILWAYS.—THE LAGOS-ABEOKUTA LINE', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Egbas of Abeokuta can run down to Lagos in the morning, and return to their homes, if they so will, on the evening of the same day; when their oil, their cotton, their kernels, their beni-seed, their ivory, and a variety of other produce now unutilized, can find its way in one day from the purchasing merchant in Abeokuta to the shipping warehouses in Lagos,—the peoples beyond will clamour for the enjoyment of similar privileges, and lend their energies to link themselves with the great Egba trunk line. The charm of increased facilities for human intercourse is contagious. Man only wraps himself up contentedly in isolation, and glories in it, and in the local ignorance and prejudices which it begets and fosters, until something better is placed within his reach. We can imagine a man born blind to be contented within himself, though somewhat curious as to what others see; but once open his eyes, and methinks he would desire to embrace the whole universe in one all-devouring gaze. The restless energies of the Anglo-Saxon race are but the accumulated impulse from successive stages in civilization, which have advanced for centuries past in one unbroken chain. The world at large owes much to the play of those energies, which have not been confined within the narrow limit of their own habitation, but have overflown into almost every region of the earth. We want to direct some portion of them now from Lagos to Kano and Kooka, to Abeokuta, as the first stage in that great progress. We have no hope in the more or less educated West Africans for this work. There are, of course, exceptions, and a few brilliant ones; but, as a body, they are content with the advantages they have themselves personally reaped by the aid of British Christians and philanthropists, and have not yet obtained a spark of that holy fire which impels a man irresistibly beyond the narrow sphere of self-interest and personal enjoyments. They are at present too much engrossed by admiration of themselves to care very much about the well-being and redemption from the bonds of ignorance of others. They have been accustomed to receive benefits, to have things done for them, until they have come to look upon these as a birthright. It is thus that the enunciation of a scheme for endowing Abeokuta with a railway communication with Lagos fell flat upon their ears. They did not see that there was in the project a stream into which they could at once dip their pitchers without an effort. They fancied that we wanted them to help—not that we merely desired to open to them an honourable door of participation in an effort for the spread of Christian civilization by means of the development of material resources. But this ignorant apathy has no influence on our decisions. For the sake of the people of Abeokuta, and of peoples beyond, if not for those of Lagos, although none would be more benefited materially than they, we want a railway from Gaun to Abeokuta. We want it; and, by God\'s help, we will have it. We are not blind to the difficulties in the path we have resolved, by God\'s help, to tread. The late revelations as to the degree of moral and spiritual iniquity into which men have fallen who had been stationed in the Egba country to preach the glad tidings of salvation, have shown us that even the influence of a portion of educated West Africa must be thrown into the scale against us. A railway would soon let in light, and therefore those who ""love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil,"" cannot desire a railway. They could not have continued, year after year, to receive money from British Christians to make known the precepts of our Divine Master, and occupied themselves at the same time in buying, selling, working, and breeding slaves. Their iniquity could not have been hid; the increased intercourse between the interior and Lagos consequent upon railway communication, even of the simplest kind, would have led to its being immediately revealed. We must have the railway. We should not, perhaps, have made these remarks at the present time, but that we feared that as we had not made mention of this railway in our February number, our enlightened friends, the few enlightened friends in Abeokuta—alas! how few!—might feel discouragement, and fancy we had ""shaken off the dust from our feet"" against the indifference of Lagos, from which scarcely one word of real appreciation and encouragement has reached us. But no. A firm resolve once formed in a Christian mind, becomes a principle of action. It is not subject to changes. Irresistible ""circumstance"" may for a time delay its execution, but the mind will not be slumbering over it, much less moved from it. Our convictions, our desires, our intentions, our resolves, are as they were when we first put forward our project, except that they have gained instead of having diminished in strength. Let the few enlightened Christian friends to the proposed railway in Abeokuta continue, therefore, their efforts to prepare the public mind for the great innovation, and to beget in it a desire for its coming. It may be some time before we can marshal the powers indispensable for the prosecution of such a work; but as we look to Him who giveth all strength to help us in it, we believe that Gaun and Abeokuta will, ere long, have their railway.', 'last_edit_date': '1880-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1880#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization? The Bible contains as good a code for the improvement of mind and manners as any book extant.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-16', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.711, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Spread of Christian Civilization in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The problem that we have set ourself to solve is the spread of Christian civilization in West Africa. To this our energies are, now, as they have been for years past, devoted. To those who have not considered the matter as we have, the idea of any rapid advancement in the solution might well seem to be Utopian. We have to deal with countries in which the dense ignorance of superstitious barbarism universally prevails—with countries in which the British people do not settle as colonists, where European mercantile houses trade, but do not leave in them any of the profits, if such there be, of their commerce, and where consequently there is little or no increase of capital that may be devoted to works of improvement. We have to deal with countries in which the action of the British Government has been hitherto simply protective, and not in any degree whatever initiative; ameliorating the condition of the people only in so far as the amelioration is necessary to give protection to trade and commerce at the stations which it occupies, and in the dependent territories, by prohibiting at and within them the outrages to humanity in which the most blood-thirsty superstition known in the world formerly indulged—in abolishing that fruitful source of evil and degradation, domestic slavery, and thus leaving the field open for the civilizing agency of commercial intercourse, the unselfish efforts of philanthropy, and of those religious societies which devote themselves to the promulgation of the glad tidings of salvation among the heathen, diffusing among them the great blessing of education, and enabling them to read those Scriptures of truth on the observance of the sacred precepts contained in which the true happiness of the human race so entirely depends. Great indeed have been and are the advantages thus bestowed upon a portion of the people of West Africa. History necessarily affords no parallel. Ere yet the efforts of the British Government to put an end to the odious foreign slave-trade had been crowned with full success, the application of steam in navigation brought those countries into easy communication with the Christian civilization of Great Britain, which may be said to have swooped down upon them, embracing many of them, educated by the religious societies, in its folds. The easy access to England thus afforded by steam has been largely, and is increasingly, availed of by those who had been thus educated, and who, by trade and commerce introduced among them, have obtained the necessary pecuniary means. Not a few of the children of these have also been sent to Great Britain for education. The civilization of Europe has thus become familiar to many, while still the great masses of the people in and beyond the narrow limits of a few Coast towns remain in the dense darkness of heathen ignorance, and more or less openly the victims of heathen superstitions, without any incentive to industrial action beyond what is necessary for obtaining the commonest necessaries of life. Now those countries in which the peoples are thus left to the natural inertia of ignorant tropical humanity, must,—that is our problem—must be brought within the area of Christian civilization. We say Christian civilization, because there is a species of Mahometan civilization, as in Persia; and of heathen, as in China; neither of which we desire for Africa. How are they to be so brought? How? They cannot be so brought except by the civilization by which, we desire them to be embraced,—advancing to their help, seeking them, searching them out, holding forth to them the hand of fellowship, showing them the material advantages it enjoys, and of which it desires to make them partakers. Year after year have we brooded over this problem, our only consolation meanwhile being that the number of more or less educated natives in the Coast towns was in constant increase; that the education they were receiving, being under missionary superintendence, included some knowledge of the articles of universal Christian belief, and, at least, a theoretical acquaintance with those blessed precepts, even the very imperfect observance of which by the inhabitants of the Christian world has contributed so largely to human happiness by emancipating mankind from the cruel tyranny of evil and bringing them partially into the delicious freedom of righteousness. Those natives, more or less educated, more or less under the influence of Christian faith, more or less imbued with Christian principles, more or less governed by Christian precepts, were indispensable as a vanguard of the great army of civilization that must be projected upon the ignorant barbarism of heathen Africa whenever the means for such projection should be arranged. That they are not themselves sufficiently under the dominion of Christian civilization to lead them to become its apostles among their hitherto less favoured countrymen has been sufficiently proved by the reception accorded by some of them in Abeokuta to the proposal made by us to link that town with Lagos by means of a railway. They would none of it. They strove to set the heathen mind against it. They would rather things should remain as they are. The education they have received has only served to develop selfishness in them, by showing them the advantages they possess through it over the heathen among whom they dwell—advantages which they do not wish to see reduced by the introduction of others into that portico of the temple of knowledge in which they have themselves secured a footing. But though their help will be unwillingly given, they will and must nevertheless become an important, as they do also constitute a necessary, element in that onward march of civilization which we have projected. The more and more we have studied the problem, the more and more convinced we become, and are, that the onward march must be by means of railways between British sea-coast possessions and the interior. No half measures will suffice. As a first step toward the working out of our problem, we put forward, some twelve months and more ago, our proposals to construct four light railways: three within the Gold Coast territories proper, and one within native territory, with a British Gold Coast Colony possession as a base. We felt that the publication of these proposals would enable us to test the degree in which the educated African element might be made co-operative in the elucidation. We soon discovered that, with two or three individual exceptions, that element was nowhere sufficiently enlightened to be co-operative in any other way than by its paid employment, whenever we should be ready with the pounds, shillings, and pence with which to make the work a personal benefit to each and all of them. Our proposals did not provoke or awake or create the smallest scintilla of interest or enthusiasm. They fell flat upon the understandings, and did not quicken the pulsations of any heart. Almost every individual fraction of this element seemed to fancy that in some way or other a railway, if introduced, would interfere with or prejudice the little trading or other game in which he was engaged; and, as we have before said, with one or two exceptions, the great broad view of human misery to be relieved, of human happiness to be increased, of human emancipation from the fetters of degrading and debasing evil to be achieved, of human benefits to be bestowed, and of the spread of the knowledge of the great and precious gift of eternal life obtainable through faith in Christ Jesus, never presented itself to mind, or heart, or soul,—engrossed only by its own little personal dust-heap, in which it might be grubbing for its own little personal enjoyments, and the gratification of its own little personal vanities and desires. This discovery, for which we were fully prepared, confirmed our views that Africa can do nothing for herself, and that every...\n**67**', 'last_edit_date': '1880-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1880#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.698, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}]",True

These treaties took two forms - those between Africans and Europeans, and bilateral agreements between the Europeans themselves. The African-European treaties were basically of two kinds. Firstly, there were the slave trade and the commercial treaties; these had generated friction, which in turn led to European political interference in African affairs. Secondly, there were the political treaties by which African rulers either purportedly surrendered sovereignty in return for protection, or undertook not to enter into treaty obligations with other European nations.\nThese political treaties were in vogue during our period. They were made either by representatives of European governments or by those of private organizations who later transferred them to their respective govern› ments. If a metropolitan government accepted them, the territories in question were usually annexed or declared a protectorate; if, on the other hand, it suspected their authenticity, or if it felt constrained by the vicissi› tudes of Weltpolitik to exercise caution, these treaties were used for bargaining purposes during the bilateral European negotiations. Africans, on the other hand, entered into these arrangements for a variety of motives, but particularly because of the interests of their people. In some cases, they desired treaty relations with Europeans because they hoped that the prestige of such a relationship would endow them with certain political advantages in dealing with their neighbours. Sometimes a weak African state would desire a treaty with a European power in the hope of using it to renounce allegiance to another African state that claimed sovereignty over it. An African sovereign would also desire a treaty in the hope of using it to keep recalcitrant subject states in line. And sometimes a treaty with one European nation was seen by some African states as a means of preserving their independence which was being threatened by other European nations.$^{42}$ Whatever was the case, the African-European political treaties played an important role in the final partition of Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.\nThis flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours. This route also linked Yorubaland with Borgu, Hausaland, Borno and beyond.

European abolitionists found, for example, that to stop the slave trade and the wars in the interior, they had to reckon not just with the coastal rulers but also with the different power bases in the interior. Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome. Similarly, British peace› makers involved in resolving aspects of nineteenth-century Yoruba warfare had to travel virtually throughout the length and breadth of the culture area.\nUnfortunately, the European approach was divisive, tending towards politically structured differentiation. This was already noticeable in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era. British interests came to be specifically protected visà-vis the interest of other European nationals; British interests were also advanced against those of Africans. We have already drawn attention to the penetration of the Benin kingdom from the Niger delta and the resultant whittling down of Benin's trading hinterland to the extent of the eventual abandonment of Ughoton, Benin's traditional port.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible.

Moreover, in addition to enjoying peace at home, however divided the European powers were on imperial and colonial issues, throughout the era of partition and up to 1914 they always managed to resolve these questions without resort to war. Thus, in spite of the intense competition and the numerous crises in Africa, the European powers involved in the partition displayed a remarkable spirit of solidarity which not only elimi› nated wars among them but also prevented the African rulers and com› munities from effectively playing one European power against the other. Throughout the period under review, various European powers took on the African states one at a time, and on no occasion was an African state assisted by one European power against another.\nBy contrast, the behaviour of the African states was not only marked by lack of solidarity, unity or co-operation but some of them did not hesitate to ally with the invading European forces against their neighbours, only to be vanquished later themselves. The Baganda allied with the British against the Banyoro, and the Barotse with the British against the Ndebele, while the Bambara teamed up with the French against the Tukulor.$^{59}$ As a result of all this, the heroic and memorable stands which the Africans took against the European invaders were - as will be seen in subsequent chapters$^{60}$ - more often than not, isolated forms of uncoordinated resist› ance, even at the regional level."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The structure of Volume VII', 'content': 'A great majority of African rulers, then, did opt for the defence of their sovereignty and independence.

We are opposed to the use of this term collaboration not only because it is inaccurate but also because it is derogatory and Eurocentric. As we have seen above, the fundamental issue at stake between the 1880s and the 1900s as far as the African rulers were concerned, was that of sove› reignty, and on this, it was quite clear that nobody was prepared to compromise. Those African rulers who have been mistakenly termed collaborators were those who thought that the best way of safeguarding their sovereignty or even regaining the sovereignty that they might have lost to some African power previous to the arrival of the Europeans was not to collaborate but rather to ally with the European invaders. A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation. But as we have seen, the Africans were all faced with the question of surrendering, retaining or regaining their sovereignty. Those who threw in their lot with the Europeans therefore had their own objective, and it is therefore totally wrong to call them collaborators.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Political structures', 'content': ""Christianity served a similar purpose, providing a cultural framework for creating a Creole society out of disparate groups of peoples settled in Freetown and surrounding villages, as in various settlements on the Liberian coast, or in Libreville, Freretown, and other freed slave settlements.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

The competition for power in Africa had been drawn into the international politics of the Concert of Europe where African diplomatic skills were at a grave disadvantage. It is doubtful whether African leaders realized until too late how great was the danger that threatened them. They were used to thinking that the European base was far away and that, in the final analysis, they had the advantage of numbers.\nThey continued to act as if they could play off one European power against another. In South Africa, they even believed that they could appeal to the Queen of England and her direct representatives to carry out treaty obligations against the wishes of Anglo-Boer settlers and fortune seekers. Far from any notion of forging a pan-African solidarity similar to that pursued by the Europeans, each African state acted as seemed best in its own individual interest.\nIt appears that, if any factor is to be singled out, the basic explanation for this was to be found not only in the diplomatic abilities of the European strategists, but also in the legacy of wars that was part of the revolutionary situation of nineteenth-century Africa.

Again the degree of exposure to these outside influences determined the type and extent of resistance put up by various societies.\nApart from these human influences, there were ecological changes taking place in East Africa in the 1890s, which also affected response to foreign penetration. The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all.

Rather, conversely, the partition of Africa was a consequence of the transformation of Africa's economic relations with the wider world, and in particular with Europe, a transformation that took place in a period beginning approximately in 1750 and culminated in the extensive European direct colonization of the last decades of the nineteenth century.\nThere had long been trading networks in various parts of Africa, and many of these networks had extended beyond the frontiers of the African continent - across the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. 1 By and large, these extra-continental trading links constituted the same kind of iong-distance trade' as that which had been well known for millennia in Asia and Europe as well. Such long-distance trade involved the exchange of so-called luxury products, that is products that were usually small in bulk and high in profit per unit of size. The production of such items for exchange tended to involve a small proportion of the manpower of the originating zones and probably a small proportion of the total value produced in these zones. In these senses, 'luxury' trade was 'non-essential' trade in that its interruption or cessation did not require any basic reor› ganization of productive processes in the originating zones. The two zones whose products were thus exchanged could not therefore be said to have been located in a single social division of labour. 2\nThe modes of trade in the Indian Ocean arena did not seem to change very much in the period between 1500 and 1800. The intrusion first of the Portuguese and later of other Europeans into this maritime zone changed the personnel somewhat, but hardly the nature or extent of this trade. Even the personnel was less changed than is often thought. As late as the 1750s in Mozambique, whose littoral had been colonized by the Portuguese, there seemed to be more Gujerati/Indian merchants than Portuguese in residence. Important changes seem to have occurred only in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the collapse of the Mughal empire and the rise of British India, as well as with the rise of the Omani Arabs on the Swahili coast. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > The beginnings of the Scramble', 'content': ""Although by the end of the third quarter of the nineteenth century, the European powers of France, Britain, Portugal and Germany had acquired commercial interests and were exercising considerable influence in different parts of Africa, their direct political control there was extremely limited.

'Refusals to annex', it has been remarked perceptively, 'are no proof of reluctance to control'.$^{34}$ This explains both the attitudes of Salisbury and Bismarck and indeed of most of the major actors in the partition.\nBut this attitude began to change as a result of three major events which occurred between 1876 and 1880. The first was the new interest which the Duke of Brabant, crowned a constitutional king (Leopold I) of the Belgians in 1865, proclaimed in Africa. This was signified by the so-called Brussels Geographical Conference which he convened in 1876 and which resulted in the setting up of the African International Association and the employment of H. M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

Indeed, Africans had been present in Western Europe from Classical Antiquity onwards, though the numbers only became substantial from about the fifteenth century on, when black Africans, first as slaves and then as freedmen, began to appear in southern Spain and Portugal, arriving at first by way of the trans-Saharan trade to North Africa. Then, as the direct maritime trade from Europe began to open in the second half of the century, still larger numbers of Africans appeared in Europe. 30 Many were slaves at first, especially in Portugal, the only significant slave-trading European power till nearly the middle of the seventeenth century. Over time, however, many found their way into the broader European society, though often at the bottom of the social hierarchy, since their social condition was assimilated to that of their fellow Africans who did most of the physical labour in the tropical colonies. Their legal status was also ambiguous. The law, in northern Europe generally, no longer recognized the status of slave, though European colonial laws did. From 1685, residence in France was held to confer freedom, and the same was true of England after the notable judicial decision of Lord Mansfield in 1772 already noted. In both situations, however, slaves from the colonies were still slaves de facto; in many instances until the European powers abolished slavery in the colonies themselves, in 1834 for Britain, 1848 for France, and 1888 for Brazil.\nIn spite of their ambiguous legal status, free Africans were present in Western Europe in considerable numbers from at least the mid-eighteenth century on. Estimates vary, but by 1800 they would have numbered several thousand in each of Spain, Portugal, France, or Britain; and in Spain or Portugal they would have been more numerous in an earlier period. The numbers were small in any case, compared with total European populations, but the African immigrants tended to be concentrated in the main cities, particularly in the port towns, so that their presence was more visible than their numbers would suggest.$^{31}$ It goes without saying that, for any period before the 1840s, far more people of tropical African descent would have been found in Europe than Europeans in tropical Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The diaspora in Europe', 'content': 'This community of Africans in Europe was also concentrated in certain occupations, especially domestic service, this being partly a carry-over from the occupational status of Africans who came by way of West Indian slavery, partly a reflection of the European fad for exotic servants.

Another significant, if smaller, group was made up of students, who began to arrive in Europe in significant numbers by the middle of the eighteenth century and, in increasing numbers, throughout the nineteenth century. In an era in which commercial contact between Europe and Africa was increasing, it was an obvious advantage to African traders to be literate in a Western language and to have some acquaintance with European accounting practices. Many of these students therefore came to Europe through the good offices of European slave-traders operating in Africa and studied under their care in the principal slave-trade ports like Liverpool or Nantes.\nStill another peculiarity of the African communities in Europe was the fact that they were overwhelmingly male. This fact had two important implications. The African community was not self-sustaining. It had to be, and was, constantly replenished from overseas. This is not to say that the Africans had no sexual relations with European women, but the products of these relationships tended to be culturally European rather than African. After a few generations, the African physical appearance tended to disappear into the general European genetic pool.\nSome Africans also found their way into Eastern Europe, in spite of a more attenuated maritime contact with tropical Africa itself.

We shall examine the practicability of this and other suggestions on another occasion:—\n\n""It is only by constant and frequent communication with Ashantee and other barbarous tribes that we can hope to bring about that state of things that will redound to the honour of England, and I have often wondered why the chief of the executive here has not attempted some effective means for this end. I would suggest the following: Let a well-paid consular agent be stationed at Kumasi,* with Prince Ansah† as interpreter; let their salary be in keeping with England\'s dignity, and I imagine schools and other missionary work would then commence in earnest in Ashantee. But it would be necessary that the King should also be induced to send us a consul or agent, who ought to be well treated, and made acquainted with the refinements of European life. He should not be an ordinary chief or captain, but one of Ashantee\'s nobles, because there are many there. With this guarantee here, our Administrator could with every safety visit Ashantee, and display, in a dignified and graceful manner, the refined customs of Europe. The Africans are very imitative, and, depend upon it, good—real good—would be the result, such good as would outweigh 5,000l. per annum, if expended in the manner it ought to be.

It was called ""The Great Peace Meeting,"" and was for the purpose of establishing permanent friendly relations amongst various tribes in the Quaiah district. For years these have been at war with each other, with the results that trade has been very much interfered with and the country impoverished. Colonel Niven, Administrator-in-Chief, attended by request of the parties to witness the signing of the treaty of peace between Lahai Bundoo and Gbannah Lehrey, two powerful chiefs, who had been at war with each other for a long time past. Various Consuls were present, and a guard of honour of 200 men of the 1st West India Regiment also attended. The treaties stipulated that the various parties would act peaceably towards each other, and that in the event of any disputes arising the matters should be referred to the British Governor at Sierra Leone, whose decision would be final. There were some 300 chiefs, present with their headmen, &c., and it is expected that the meeting will put an end to the numerous quarrels and conflicts which have occurred in this district. After the proceedings a number of English and other traders addressed a letter to Colonel Niven, requesting him to allow Day Mauro, King of Bullom, and Allimany Sawassi, Chief Medina, to go up to Fort Hokkoh to settle a war then going on between two powerful chiefs and their followers. They believed that the influence of the two chiefs mentioned could be successfully used to put a stop to further fighting. Colonel Niven promised to consider the matter.\n\nIt was officially announced that the blockade at the port of Brass by the English men-of-war would not take place, as the fine demanded by Commodore Richards had been paid by the natives.\n\nThe English schooner, William the Sixth, belonging to Mr. T. Ridgway, of Exmouth, has been lost off Grand Bassam. She had a quantity of African produce on board.

The trade flourished, and Ja Ja was respected for his fair dealing and his great ability to govern his own people. Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets. Ja Ja was made prisoner by Consul Johnstone, and carried off to Accra. An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river. He will, however, be allowed an annual pension of £800 for life.\n\nThe principle having been laid down that Europeans may trade in the interior, it becomes imperative to assume definite authority over the district. The ""customs"" have been abolished, a uniform export duty of 2s. 6d. per ton being levied instead. As things stand, we make no pretence to the sovereignty of the country; we only constitute ourselves the final authority in matters of dispute between the natives and traders of whatever nationality, and debar our continental neighbours from proclaiming themselves masters of the country. Whether things will remain as they now are is the doubtful point; pretexts for occupation are so easily found when wanted that it would be rash to answer. Some tribe is reached who cannot understand dual control; they insist on customs, perhaps; are ""chastised"" by the Consul; they retaliate, and finally an occupation is proclaimed. This is the danger to which we are exposed, for the destruction of the natives means loss to the traders and the abandonment of commerce.

Since the abolition of the export of slaves, these localities have been the sites of trading stations, palm oil being the chief article of export. The traders have been, with few exceptions, British, and the capitalists mostly Liverpool merchants. The natives allowed trading hulks to be anchored and commerce conducted on payment of fixed sums, known as ""comey."" Bonny, Brass, and Old Calabar are among the oldest of these trading ports, the native chiefs being also the native traders. They possessed numerous slaves who were sent with merchandise to the interior markets to collect oil, which was brought to the stations and sold to the whites.

Of his enemies the most powerful was Oko Jumbo, who lost no opportunity to humiliate him. The Europeans could only let matters take their course; they regretted constant fighting of Oko Jumbo and Ja Ja, but the relations between the Europeans and natives being strictly commercial, nothing could be done. Suffering reverses, Ja Ja was forced to fly with the remnant of his people after great slaughter at the hands of Oko Jumbo.

There was a large attendance.\n\nThe Lecturer, after observing that one of the most remarkable features of the century had been the phenomenal interest displayed in all things African, and that people\'s imaginations had been touched by the varied story of the Dark Continent, drew attention to the apparently unselfish form of the public interest manifested in Africa. The very atmosphere was electric with the most wonderful schemes—religious, philanthropic, and commercial—for the exclusive benefit of the negro. From platform and pulpit rose a clamour of voices, in which was heard the popular watchwords of the day—civilisation, progress, the good of the negro, legitimate commerce, conversion of the heathen, and other high-sounding phrases, all having relation to the good things to be done for the African. The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation. They never heard now of the trader who went to Africa with the merely selfish object of making his fortune. Each and all became pioneers of civilisation, thinking only of the native first and self afterwards. They spoke as if the good to the native had been enormous, and that their intercourse with him had been a benefit and blessing. They pointed with pride to their sacrifices in the suppression of the slave trade, to their West Coast settlements as centres of secular light and leading; to their missionary stations as stars twinkling in the night of heathendom; to the returns of their trade with every entrance to the heart of Africa, as showing the spread of their beneficial influence. They saw that the work of other nations had been pernicious in the extreme, that they had been brutal in their dealings with native races, and had thought only of their own sordid interests and national aggrandisement—all in marked contrast to their aims and methods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'FRENCH AFRICAN EXPLORATION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The writer proceeds to give some interesting information about a European established in these parts, one M. Philippe Broyon, a native of Switzerland. ""M. Broyon is about thirty-three years of age. He is tall, thin, and muscular, and looks like a soldier. He did not marry the daughter of Mirambo, as has been stated, but a negress whom he rescued from slavery. He was formerly employed at Zanzibar, but subsequently took to travelling in Africa and carrying on the ivory trade. The English often tried to purchase his services, but without success, for he does not like them. However, forced by necessity, he has accepted their offers, and is now conducting a caravan of merchandise for the English.\n\nAs regards one of the monarchs of Africa, the Abbé says: ""Mirambo enjoys in Europe a reputation far beyond his merits. He is a cruel tyrant, whose caprice is the only law known. His army reckons scarcely more than four hundred men. If he does not make the Europeans pay the right of passage, he knows how to make up for it in another and far more advantageous way. He proposes to every white man who crosses his country the pact of blood. At the end of the ceremony he makes a few gifts, but he besieges the European in return with demands which have to be satisfied.""\n\nThe writer concludes with some remarks respecting the doings of the English. He says: ""The English occupy Mpapona, which is a strategical position of the first order. All the routes which lead to Unyamezi pass by it. It is not six months that they have been there, and already four handsome stone houses have been built. A clergyman, a mason, and a carpenter compose all the personnel of the station. They are eminently practical men. The English have founded another station in the Ukereone, a third in the Uganda, and a fourth at Ujiji. The power of the Arabs in these parts is decreasing daily. The ivory trade no longer satisfies their wants, and as the slave-trade is prohibited, they will soon be forced to leave the colonies which they have founded in the interior of Africa, and the English will take their place.', 'last_edit_date': '1879-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1879#article-26', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.629, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization? The Bible contains as good a code for the improvement of mind and manners as any book extant.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-16', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told. More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills. Ivory has all but disappeared. Ebony and other woods are increasing in volume, and cocoa quickly rising into importance, as well as rubber.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.627, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MR.

These were strong statements, they would say, and required confirmation. If true, what could possibly have caused this frightful miscarriage of the noblest aspirations of a Christian people?

The Phoenicians treated the part of Africa which they colonised as the British would, as the foundation of trade and commerce. The Phoenicians were followed, about 650 B.C., by the Greeks, who founded their first African colony Cyrene, on the coast of Tripoli. Then came the Carthaginians. They and the Greeks carried on a busy commerce all along the Mediterranean coast, far down to the Atlantic coast, to the mouth of the Red Sea. These were followed by the Romans, who continued an active career on the African coast until the decay of the Roman Empire.\n\nMr. Scott Keltie showed how little was known of the interior of Africa up to 150 A.D. by Ptolemy\'s map being thrown on to the sheet in the darkened theatre. This map, which was filled up haphazard fashion, gathered up, the lecturer said, all the knowledge of the continent which had accumulated during this long period of commercial activity — a knowledge which amounted to very little beyond the coasts and the Nile Valley. The next important period dealt with was the period of Arab invasion and the spread of the tenets of Mohammedanism — namely, from the seventh to the fifteenth century. In the early part of the fifteenth century commenced the ""glorious"" period of Portuguese activity, which lasted for some sixty years, during which the contour of the coast of Africa was completely laid down. This began the real modern partition of Africa, and the lecturer dwelt upon the effect which could be traced to Portuguese occupation of African territory — that occupation being marked by ruin rather than by enterprise. He rapidly traced the occupation of points of territory by Portuguese, Spanish, French, English, Dutch, Danish, and Germans, whose commerce was in ivory and slaves. He held that the opening up of the continent of Africa might be said to have begun with Bruce\'s travels in Abyssinia in the latter part of the eighteenth century. From that time until 1850 nearly the whole map of Africa became gradually filled up, and from 1850 down to the present day the southern half of the continent had received increasing attention at the hands of explorers until it also had had its main features laid down.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858. But local opposition to the Baptists continued to be high, especially as many of the Anglo-West Indian settlers at Victoria also traded in competition with the Bimbia population."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': ""Because the lands and peoples were so interwoven, developments in one part always had effects and implications in other parts.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome.

This was already noticeable in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era. British interests came to be specifically protected visà-vis the interest of other European nationals; British interests were also advanced against those of Africans.

The first was the new interest which the Duke of Brabant, crowned a constitutional king (Leopold I) of the Belgians in 1865, proclaimed in Africa. This was signified by the so-called Brussels Geographical Conference which he convened in 1876 and which resulted in the setting up of the African International Association and the employment of H. M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

As a result of a delegation it dispatched to London in 1898 which met the Secretary of State for Colonies, this obnoxious Bill was withdrawn. From then on, the ARPS sent a series of petitions to the local administration as well as the Colonial Office protesting against various projected Bills. It sent two delegations to England, one in 1906 to demand the repeal of the 1894 Towns Ordinance and the second in 1911 to oppose the Forestry Bill of 1910. It was certainly the most successful of the mouthpieces of the elite and traditional rulers of West Africa and the greatest opponent of colonialism until the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa after the First World War. In French West Africa, the Young Senegalese Club formed in 1910 also actively campaigned for equal rights.\nIt should be evident from this discussion that the peoples of West Africa devised all kinds of strategies and tactics first to oppose the establish› ment of the colonial system and second, after the failure of their early efforts, to resist certain specific measures and institutions of the system.

When King Leopold called an international conference in Brussels in 1876 'to discuss methods of peaceful and co- operative action to develop legitimate commerce and attack the slave trade',$^{62}$ the rivalry was already appearing on the surface. The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo.

For the British the action was justified because of the strategic position of Egypt (with the Suez Canal and the Nile) for British interests in India and East Africa, although East Africa was considered of less importance. But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year.

Moreover, Shepstone, the key source of information in the 1870s for British policy-makers and operators, was not only concerned about immediate solutions to the problem of securing African labour for the British capital› ists, but looked further to see the solution to the whole problem as lying in a federation of the white states with a common African policy. Clearly, therefore, some accounts of British imperialism in South Africa have neglected the growing economic importance of the region to Britain, a situation which became increasingly apparent at the end of the 1860s with the discovery of diamonds and reports of gold deposits, and most evident in the i88os when gold began to be mined in the Witwatersrand.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The First World War and its consequences', 'section_title': 'The socio-political consequences of the War', 'content': ""There is no doubt that the war opened up new windows for many Africans, particularly the educated elite groups. Margery Perham has written that it is 'difficult to overestimate the effect upon Africans, who had been largely enclosed within a bilateral relationship with their European rulers, of looking outside this enclosure and seeing themselves as part of a continent and of a world'.$^{64}$ In many parts of Africa the war gave a boost, if not always to nationalist activity, at least to the development of a more critical approach by the educated elites towards their colonial masters. Bethwell Ogot has suggested that the shared wartime experience of African and European soldiers had a similar effect for the less-educated: The African soldier soon discovered the weaknesses and the strength of the European, who up to that time had been regarded by the majority of Africans as a superman. In fact, the warrant and non› commissioned African officers were instructing European volunteers in the technique of modern warfare. It was becoming evident that the European did not know everything. The returning porters and soldiers spread the new views of the white man; and much of the self-confidence and assertiveness that the Africans in Kenya displayed in the 1920s had a lot to do with this new knowledge. 65 He also points out that, significantly, several African political leaders in Kenya had either fought or served in the East African campaign. In Guinea the return of the anciens combattants heralded strikes, riots in the de› mobilization camps and attacks on the authority of chiefs. 66 If the war saw an end of attempts by Africans to regain the lost sovereignty of their pre-colonial polities, it also saw a rise in demands for participation in the process of government of the new polities imposed on them by the Europeans. These demands - inspired by President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points which were made in reaction to the Soviet proposals put forward in October 1917 for the immediate conclusion of peace without annexation or indemnity - even extended to the right to self-determination. In the case of the Arab countries of North Africa the joint announcement by Britain and France in November 1918 that the Allies were contemplating the enfranchisement of peoples oppressed by the Turks presented the spectacle of one group of Arabs being offered independence, while another, ruled by those very powers who were offering freedom to the Turkish provinces, was denied it."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Marketing', 'content': ""Certainly, until the early 1930s, the tendency was to encourage whoever was likely to contribute in this respect. Thus Indian traders were not only allowed, but, to some extent, were also encouraged to patronize trade in East Africa, and to some extent in Central Africa.

The 'dislike and distrust of the Levantine communities' in West Africa, which Professor Bauer noticed to be 'marked in official circles', 71 was a relatively recent development. Real hostility towards the Levantines, mostly Lebanese, came not from official circles but from the various European agents of commercial firms, and such hostility was in response to effective trade rivalry presented by the Levantines.$^{72}$ And where British firms appear to have been given preference, it was not because of their respectability, but because they could - with the blessing of the British government - act as effective pressure groups and influence colonial policy› makers. 73 Still, Ehrlich's generalization that 'administrative attitudes, throughout British Africa, rarely encouraged indigenous commercial initiative'$^{74}$ is quite valid. But other factors stifled local initiatives. First of all, general official policy, as would be expected in a colonial situation, was geared primarily towards the advancement of imperialist interests. Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction. By the first decade of the twentieth century, following the construction of railways, European firms were squeezing African traders in two related ways. Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

It was the latter, described as the 'aspirant bourgeoisie' by Susan Kaplow,33 who, as will be seen later, pushed the frontiers of retail trade in the Gold Coast, Sierra Leone and Nigeria further and further inland during the period under review. As one report from the Gold Coast put it, by 1850, the young men had gone to reside in the interior as traders and clerks and it was they who were 'causing a great increase in the consumption of the manufactures ofGreat Britain and are widely extending commerce and civilisation amongst the native population'.34 Similar social developments took place in Madagascar and in Central and East Africa. Thus, by the end of the period under review a new rung had been added to the social ladder in Africa, an educated elite which had become divided into a professional class of doctors, ministers, teachers, catechists and agents and an aspirant bourgeoisie or entrepreneur group, as some would prefer to call them, of educated traders and merchants."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Pan-Africanism: political and cultural aspects', 'content': ""Besides these educational exchanges, a series of pan-Africanist organizations and conferences, as well as commercial and literary or cultural activities 47.

Similarly, in West Africa especially, where many indifferently educated Africans were able to interpose themselves as middlemen between the primary producers and the big European commercial companies, commercial success also provided a ready passport to the new elite status. There were, however, others who qualified for consideration as members of the elite because they controlled mass organizations like labour unions and could give the better-educated elite the kind of mass support which they needed to convince the colonial powers that they spoke for the people. On the contrary, in East and Central Africa relatively few Africans gained admission into the elite group as a result of the deliberate policies pursued by the colonial rulers and the activities of the Indians and Portuguese and Greek petty traders. In fact, in many of these areas, the old central elite virtually disappeared.\nIt is largely this wide variation in their qualifications and background that makes it so difficult to define precisely in those terms who were the new elite of colonial Africa. One can thus justifiably argue that the issue of the rise of a new elite among any African people in the colonial era was largely a question of what amount and kind of educational and economic opportunities were available to the people and how far they put those opportunities to effective use.

In most cases it was labour, and not land, which was the scarcer means of production.\nForeigners, mostly British, secured and held concessions on land with mineral and timber resources, but such arrangements had little adverse effect on the local agricultural communities.

Occupation and biological heritage could and did increase class and caste mobility both during and after slavery. An individual or a family could work their way outward and often upward from slavery to freedom, or from free black to mulatto (especially in Brazil and Spanish America), or from mulatto to white (an exceptional achievement requiring a considerable amount of money) when the indices of race were more strongly cultural than biological.

Ultimately, however, internal social mobility and the general quality of life depended on the immediate circumstances of the community: on factors of demography, economy, law, social and political philosophy, and degree of cultural pluralism. For the less stable or mature the society, the more the Africans and Afro-Americans influenced the structure and carved a niche for themselves and their descendants.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Related to ideology as a factor is the settler factor.

The reduction of these responsibilities in Central Africa to a minimum lies at the root of this sudden revival of rule by chartered companies. Great Britain, indeed, extends to these dependent States her protection against external interference or conquest by other civilised countries; but each chartered company is expected to maintain its own internal defences, to pacify its savage neighbours by force or subsidies or a judicious combination of both, and to civilise and develop the regions committed to its charge at its own cost and risk. Both Liberal and Conservative Governments have led, or yielded to, this new popular movement. Mr. Gladstone granted the Royal Niger Charter in 1886. Lord Salisbury, last year, granted the Imperial East Africa Charter, and, by the extension of British protection over the North Borneo Company, brought it into a corresponding relation to the Empire. He now intends to secure British interests in South Africa by the issue of the charter announced by Sir James Fergusson.\n\nIt was, therefore, at an opportune moment that the *Fortnightly Review*, for August, published Mr. Joseph Thomson\'s interesting article, entitled ""Downing Street v. Chartered Companies."" Mr. Joseph Thomson\'s opinion on African matters is not to be lightly set aside. He is, next to Mr. Stanley, the best known of our African explorers. His experience has been both wide and varied, and he has shown himself thoroughly capable of appreciating and judging the African peoples through whom he has passed. The chartered companies have a valuable ally in Mr. Thomson when he throws himself energetically into the scale on their side.'}]","[{'document_title': 'SUBSCRIPTIONS TO AFRICAN-AID SOCIETY', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""| Name | Amount (£ s. d.) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Robert Ferguson, Esq., Morton House, Carlisle (an.) | 1 1 0 |\n| Henry Angus, Esq., Newcastle-on-Tyne (1863, 1864) | 2 2 0 |\n| Messrs.

Bring with you the best you have: the swiftest and most beautiful of your horses, the strongest ox, the fattest sheep, also specimens of your cleanest cotton, your best grown indigo, ginger, ground nuts, and all produce of the earth, together with pages, country cloth, baskets, saddles, bridles, and whatever else you can display of the industry and trade of your subjects and country.\n\n3. These articles, O Kings and Chiefs, will be placed side by side with the work of my people in Bathurst, whereupon I will convey all to Sierra Leone in the Dover; there a great house will be built by Major Blackall, the Queen\'s representative, to display these things to all the world. Moreover, Her Majesty\'s white subjects in England, artizans and others, who gain their daily bread, as Adam did, by the sweat of his brow, will send across the great water their work. More beautiful will be the articles than you see for sale in the stores of Bathurst.

The mission of these Envoys marks a stage in a series of negotiations. They are six in number, the chief amongst them being Prince A. A. Ossoo-Ansah, a son of Prince Ansah, who, in 1874, after the Ashanti War and the deposition of King Coffee, visited England for the purpose of clearing himself of imputations as to disloyalty to England during that war, and of obtaining compensation for the destruction of his property by the enemy. Prince Ossoo Ansah is the only one of the six who can speak English, and is appointed to act as interpreter and spokesman. The purpose of the visit has been stated in telegraphic despatches, but some fuller information is now available. It seems that the relations of Great Britain towards Ashanti have, with the sanction of the French Government, assumed somewhat new features, as it has been recognised as falling within the British sphere of influence. With the increased assurance of protection thus afforded, British traders have extended their operations in the country, which is extremely fertile in general produce, and especially rich in gold. The Governor of Cape Coast Castle, Sir W. Brandford Griffith, has consequently been led to propose the extension of British authority in a more formal manner—the establishment of a British Resident at the capital, Coomassie (or Kumasi). This step having been taken, the next would naturally be the definite conversion of the country into a British Protectorate. But to this idea a considerable number of the Natives have expressed the most decided objection; and it is with the idea of expressing the popular feeling upon this point that these six ""ambassadors"" have been appointed with the intention that they should seek an interview with the Queen, and lay before her Majesty the reasons why such a course would be so unpopular among their people.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-05-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_05_1895#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CAPTAIN CAMERON, R.N., ON AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""This meeting views with satisfaction the attention paid by her Majesty\'s Government to British interests in Africa, and trusts that the results of their policy may be beneficial alike to the natives and to the legitimate enterprise of British subjects in that continent.""\n\nAfter an animated discussion, in which various gentlemen interested took part, the resolution was carried unanimously.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-07-18', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1890#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'If the character, in a geographical sense, of the burning questions of the hour be analysed, it will be found that Africa and African interests engage the greater part of Englishmen\'s thoughts at the present moment. It is true that the great historical drama now being played out in Ethiopia includes an infinite variety of characters and a wide diversity of scenes; but one stage holds them all. The progress of the Khartoum Relief Expedition, the better government of Egypt, the high-handed action of the Boers in Zululand, the activity of German aggression on the West Coast, and the vast possibilities involved in the systematic colonisation of the Congo territory, represent only a few of the more urgent considerations now forcing themselves on the country\'s attention. Yet this enumeration, brief though it be, more than suffices to show the extent and importance of English interests in Africa. In view of the active ambition of other nations, these two points cannot be too frequently or too strongly insisted upon; for the physical peculiarities of the ""Dark Continent"" find their counterpart in its political features. Among the great divisions of the globe it occupies an absolutely unique position. Excepting the Valley of the Nile, Cape Colony and the immediately adjoining territories, together with little more than a fringe of coast settlements, Africa might, not long since, have been broadly and generally described as one vast ""No Man\'s Land."" Little by little—the huge dimensions of the continent rendering encroachment almost imperceptible—England, led by the pioneers of her trade and commerce, has succeeded in laying the foundations of an African Empire that promises one day to eclipse the might, no less than the wealth, of the richest possession of the British Crown. But while this prospect has excited the envy, it has also stirred the emulation of other nations, and England apparently is not to be allowed to shape and wield the destinies of the ""Dark Continent"" either undisturbed or unopposed. Consolation may, however, be found in the thought that the development of responsibilities will be accompanied by an increase of strength and determination adequate to the demands of the occasion, while a special measure of assurance may be drawn from the decisive, though dangerously-delayed, measures now at last urged forward by the Government for the relief of General Gordon. If an equally clear, energetic, and truly popular policy were at once adopted, not only as regards the Boers in Zululand and in the Transvaal, but also with respect to the colonisation of the Congo districts, and other scarcely less momentous questions, the country would be prepared to quietly abide the course of events, feeling assured that time and the effect produced by national characteristics fought on the side of British dominion in Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1884#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CAPTAIN CAMERON, R.N., ON AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the meeting of the Balloon Society, on July 18, a lecture was delivered by Captain V. Lovett Cameron, R.N., on ""Africa.""\n\nThe lecturer said that the further British influence extended in Africa the more would slavery of every kind be done away with. Besides illegal slavery, there was extensively practised in Africa a system of native despotism which it was very desirable should be abolished. In 1876 nobody seemed to take any notice of Africa, and the exportation of India-rubber from Zanzibar amounted to something under £20,000. Now the amount was about £250,000! With respect to ill-health in that continent, he had found that some of the native treatments were by no means to be despised, and many of our English doctors could take a leaf out of their book. The record of men who had travelled through Africa and endured every conceivable kind of hardship proved that Africa had been cursed by the idea of its unhealthiness, a reproach which it did not deserve. The great thing required, however, was adequate communication. African travelling, under present circumstances, meant, at the outside, fifty miles in a week. At the present time every mile of railroad laid down in Africa drove a dozen nails into the coffin of the slave-trade, to say nothing of the immense impetus to trade and commerce which would thus be afforded. From Cairo right away to the Albert Nyanza was navigable water. There would be no difficulty in overcoming the obstacles of cataracts, &c., which modern engineering would easily surmount. The central high plateau of Africa was, to a great extent, in British hands, and offered the most important means of repressing the slave-trade in future. Every slave working at the present time was in direct defiance of the Act of 1873. Mr. Rhodes\' great railway, which would reach Zambesia within eight years, should be kept under British control, as native treaties were more or less uncertain. In 1876 they could have obtained all that is now German territory by holding up their hands. The Germans, however, are practically locked in. A dispute had been going on with Portugal as to whether the Zambesi was an open highway. Fortunately, owing to the twenty-one miles strip of land granted by England to Germany these two powers would be as one on the question, and in future arbitration claim the Zambesi as an open highway. A wise system of emigration should be conducted. He would like to see Indian planters transferred there, and Chinese too. Africa offered an excellent opening for the English working man, and it was desirable that the Government should protect its emigrants. The dangers of Africa were largely dwelt on nowadays, and its advantages were put in the rear. This was the reason why the development of that great continent was so far behind hand.\n\nThe following resolution was proposed by Admiral Field, M.P., seconded by Mr. Johnson (of the Stanley Falls, Congo):—', 'last_edit_date': '1890-07-18', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1890#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Though Englishmen naturally think that English rule is best, other nations cannot be as thoroughly persuaded of the truth.

A grant of 10,000 acres, situated near a civilised centre, is required as a basis. The land will be divided into ten sections of 1,000 acres each; and, upon each of these divisions, ten carefully selected and well-trained families will be located. A sum of £25,000 will be required to enable the settlers to hold out for the first three years, while adjusting themselves to their new habitat, and to pay for the land should it be found necessary to purchase it.\n\nDuring this period each head of a family would receive sufficient food and clothing for himself and his household, but would not be entitled to any further remuneration. At the beginning of the fourth year, however, an additional allowance of £30 per annum would, in like manner, be given, as it is hoped that by that time an income would be obtained from the land under cultivation. This arrangement would continue until the close of the tenth year, when the land would become the property of the people. The net proceeds of their earnings during this said period would be employed in the spread of civilisation among the Natives, and in the assisting of other enterprising Africans who were desirous of returning and settling down in their Fatherland.\n\nThe £25,000 necessary to float the scheme is not required at present. It will be raised with the help of a Committee\n\nwhen the proper time arrives. I purpose, first of all, to go, spy out, and secure the land; secondly, to proceed to the West Indies to select the first 100 families as pioneers.\n\nTo meet this preliminary expense and charges already incurred in connexion with the maturing and developing of the scheme, a sum of not less than £650 is required. About £300 of this moderate amount has already been subscribed by more than 200 highly representative friends, and further contributions are earnestly solicited from all who take an interest in the progress of the African race.\n\nSubscriptions can be sent to the Treasurers—Edward P. Thomson, Esq., W.S., 76 George Street, Edinburgh; and Alexander Breingan, Esq., Bank of Scotland, Helensburgh, N.B.—who will duly acknowledge the same. The name and address of each subscriber, together with the amount given, will then be entered in one of the official books, specially provided for the purpose.

H. Johnston said ever since the end of last century the attention of the British had been given to the opening up of tropical Africa. It was, however, directed by the instinct of commercial expansion and the desire of planting among the natives our ideas of religion and philanthropy. On many occasions the Government had disavowed any intention of political aggrandisement. It was only lately that we could thank those who held the reins of Government for the position we now occupied as an African Power. Whatever had been done previously had been accomplished by traders and missionaries. This country was the first to send out a surveying expedition to the Congo, and yet we were ready to give in once to the partition of its territory among various European countries. It was the same after a magnificent campaign in Ashantee and Abyssinia. Millions of money had been spent and brave men had lost their lives from 1799 to 1890 to practically no purpose. But it was querulous to make complaints about what had been done in view of what had recently occurred. The result of Lord Salisbury\'s action in respect of African affairs would be of stupendous import, and the possession of such territory was a matter of great moment, for it was a fact that nowhere did Englishmen and their civilising work thrive so well as they did under conditions of existence and regulations made by themselves. Let other countries have their fair share of the Dark Continent as a theatre for their expansion, and let England now set herself to the duty of developing the resources of those lands which she had secured. There were two ways in which Africa might be governed under the British flag. One was by chartered companies, and the other by direct Imperial rule; and it would almost seem better if Africa were always governed direct, in some form or other of Imperial Government, though this was not always practically possible. A Parliament always grumbled over the cost to the Exchequer of such a place as Bechuanaland was not likely to vote money in an extension of such sway. The majority of men sent to Parliament were badly instructed in geography, and were indifferent to the interests of Great Britain, and the object of some of them seemed to be to hinder the expansion and maintenance of the British Empire. It was well, therefore, that there should be conferred upon the great administrating companies rights and privileges in return for the work they did and the money they were called upon to expend. He was thankful that such companies were formed to make their experiments in empire-founding. Yet, if a considerable amount of money, say £250,000 a year, were expended imperially in opening up and governing Africa, what an immense return it would make, and what an effect it would have upon the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, London, and other places. Africa would take their hardware, cotton goods, agricultural implements, sewing machines, knives, needles, steel railways, tin provisions, coals, pianos, harmoniums, fireworks, and other products, which would have an ever-widening consumption. In return there would be a most profitable exchange. Great as our Indian Empire was, it was only able to employ half of the well-conducted British youth. Africa would find employment for the remainder if a similar Government service were inaugurated there, and he did not think that with the changes which would be effected by the inauguration of the British, Africa would be a bit more unhealthy than India. But Africa should not be a theatre for the failures of life here—of the bankrupt, the ne\'er-do-weels, and such like. Men should be trained for the work, as they were in China and elsewhere. To succeed in Africa, a man must have a liking for the place, he must be enthusiastic in his work, and ready to bear up against the monotony which prevailed everywhere in an uncivilised land. He must be abstemious and self-denying; there must be no gluttony, or high living. Reviewing the wealth of Africa, he enumerated its valuable wild beasts, which he would like to see preserved to give colour to our existence, as well as for their intrinsic worth. Adverting to the vegetable products of the tropical regions he pointed out that they were all of commercial value, and that with the establishing of a settled government, and the introduction of systematic cultivation, they might be extended almost indefinitely. As for rubber, indigo, gums, reeds, etc., there was at present a great export, while cotton might be grown profitably to an enormous extent. The palm oil trade led to the settlement of the ""oil rivers,"" which from a swamp had been transformed into a comparatively healthy residential and commercial district. Besides these kinds of produce, ranging from £10 to £25 per ton, there were dyewoods and forests of timber of most valuable kind. Gold was found running all the way up the continent from the south, at any rate as far as Darfur and the Soudan, and diagonally westwards into the Niger basins. Silver was found in the western portions of the continent in conjunction with antimony, and as the latter metal had been found in other parts, it was reasonable to suppose that silver would be found also. Copper was found in South Central Africa, and iron was found in abundance, while good coal had been discovered on the shores of Lake Nyassa and the Zambesi, as well as other places. He need scarcely allude to the diamond fields, but it was certain that other precious stones—topazes, opals, &c.—were found in certain districts. What he had named were only a small portion of the products of these regions, and many more were to be discovered and utilised. Speaking of the native population, he pointed out that they were distributed into irregularly\n**167**', 'last_edit_date': '1890-11-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/07_11_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Leader', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'GREAT BRITAIN commenced her work of colonising Africa by the foundation of Sierra Leone, more than a hundred years ago: and even her best friends must admit that, except in the regions ruled by the Royal Niger Company, the progress of her influence in West Africa has not been very much to her credit.

I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain. If we gave away the Gold Coasts or Lagos, or the Niger, for instance, in exchange for concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or the North Atlantic, the ratio of loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be far greater than the gain to the Australians or the Newfoundlanders. To those who argue that our missionaries and merchants might go on working in West Africa just the same, even if the rule in our possession were transferred to another Power, I would ask, \'How many British merchants are there in French Senegambia? What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value. Then as to Zanzibar and British East Africa, they, in their turn, besides securing the southern approach to the dominions of our Egyptian ward, are a necessity to the trade and overflow emigration of our great Indian Empire, with its nearly 300,000,000 of people and its yearly trade with the British Empire of some £90,000,000. The trade of the British Empire with British Africa amounts to about £25,200,000 yearly. Among the more valuable products which British Africa sends us, or supplies to herself, may be cited the following: gold, silver, copper, coal, diamonds, ivory, rubber, palm oil, palm kernels, gums, cotton, dyewoods, indigo, coffee, sugar, rice, Indian corn, horses, cattle, donkeys, hides, amomum seeds, red peppers, and many other valuable dyes, spices, oils, timber, drugs, skins, and farinaceous foods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The history of British commercial connexion with this part of Africa may be briefly told. More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills. Ivory has all but disappeared.

Where the population was only sparse, that might be accounted for by the tribal warfare which prevailed, and which could be suppressed by the introduction of civilisation. What was wanted was that peace should be maintained, and trade encouraged, to raise the natives to a civilised condition. The native population was divisible into three great classes—the Arab, the Negroid, and the Negro. The Arab race they met from the Nile to the Zambesi, and in the Sahara, as well as about the Great Lakes. They were the merchants and the traders, while the Negroids were the occupiers and cultivators of the soil. It was singular that, while the Arab race had endeavoured to oust the British from the Soudan, they had assisted them at Zanzibar. It was difficult to deal with them, and it would not do to drive them out as the Moors had been driven from Spain. The best thing to do would be to make them useful in Central Africa, to deal with them as we found them, and to place in their way such commercial prospects that they might be induced to abandon the slave trade. If they once got the Arab to join them, they could easily put a stop to the butcheries of the negro races by each other. As to the Negroids, they were being gradually absorbed by the other two races. The most important race to the British Empire was the Negro, who was capable of being rapidly civilised. He could not raise himself unaided, and he still remained as he had been limned 4,000 years ago upon the Egyptian frescoes. Yet as soon as he was brought into contact with civilisation he took it up rapidly, and soon became a good clerk, an engineer, a cook, or domestic servant. The Negro was far less alien to our civilisation than the Chinaman, and in the course of about 300 years there would be very little difference between him and the European except the colour of the skin. They might be weaned from slave-dealing, man-hunting, the burning of witches, and the offering of human sacrifices, and he did not know of any African prince who could be accused of anything like the beheadings and the quarterings that took place in the reigns of Henry VIII., Mary, and Elizabeth, nor did he find that any native African priesthood had been guilty of one-tenth of the horrible cruelty which had been perpetrated in Europe under the name of religion. In conclusion, he observed that if these portions of Africa with which he has been dealing could but be brought under the influence indicated, it would bring them an increase of knowledge, of wealth, and of power such as had accrued to them from their dominions in Asia.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-11-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/07_11_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}]",True

In these works he also advocated 'Africa for the Africans', pan-Africanism, the African personality, Islam and polygamy which were to him more in keeping with African personality, insisted on the purity and integrity of the black race and therefore condemned mixed marriages, championed Ethiopianism and, above all, preached racial pride. In an article published in 1874, he praised the Mande and Fulbe peoples, who were Muslims and were developing the idea of a national and social order without the aid or hindrance of foreigners.

They also set themselves the task of refuting and disproving racist ideas and practices in a series of articles, pamphlets, books and speeches, and it was this that gave rise to the second of the unique processes of the period, namely, the intellectual revolution and the accompanying birth of African racial consciousness, pan-Africanism and the concept of the African personality. The pioneers of this revolution in West Africa were undoubt› edly James Africanus Horton (1835-83) and Edward Wilmot Blyden (18321912).

Responding to the challenge of the new opportunities, German missionaries, mostly from the Basel Mission but with a few from the Bremen Mission, overcame their pietist hesitation and became involved in the politics of development in a British colony. They and their British colleagues found more opportunities as farm managers, linguists, teachers, builders, and promoters of commercial enterprises than as preachers. A number of mission stations were established, and leading individual missionaries became deeply involved in local political and racial conflicts; nevertheless, nothing like the Freetown success was achieved. Elsewhere, missionary organizations were being founded, and a few pioneer mission stations established in which preliminary educational efforts and linguistic studies were being undertaken that would yield fruit later.

With the present prospects and privileges before his race - with the chances of arduous work, noble suffering, and magnificent achievement before them - I would rather be a member of this race than a Greek in the time of Alexander, a Roman in the Augustin period, or an AngloSaxon in the nineteenth century. 46 It was also Blyden who in his famous speech to the American Col› onization Society in May 1880 gave great publicity to the phrase 'Ethiopia Stretching Out her Hands Unto God' and equated Ethiopian with African; and it was he who first used the term 'African personality' in his lecture delivered on 19 May 1893 in Freetown when he described the African Race as 'a Great Race - great in its vitality, in its power of endurance and its prospect of perpetuity'. He continued: It is sad to think that there are some Africans, especially among those who have enjoyed the advantages of foreign training, who are so blind to the radical facts of humanity as to say, 'Let us do away with the sentiment of Race. Let us do away with our African personality and be if possible in another Race ... Preach this doctrine as much as you like, no one will do it, for no one can do it, for when you have done away with your personality, you have done away with yourselves ... the duty of every man, of every race is to contend for its individuality to keep and develop it ... Therefore, honour and love your Race ... If you are not yourself, if you surrender your personality, you have nothing left to give to the world .. . 47 Another great leader of the intellectual revolution of the time was undoubtedly that fiery Yoruba-Creole evangelist, James Johnson (c. 18361917). Like Horton, he was born and educated in Sierra Leone at the Freetown Grammar School and Fourah Bay College and taught in that institution from i860 to 1863.

Indeed, it was the Creoles, as the educated people of Sierra Leone came to be called, who pioneered most of the missionary and educational activities in the other parts of West Africa. Three typical examples were James Africanus Horton who was born in 1835 in Sierra Leone, trained in Britain as a doctor from 1853 to 1859 and entered the West African Medical Service as a Staff Assistant Surgeon; Samuel Ajayi Crowther who was one of the first products of Fourah Bay College and the first African to be ordained as a Bishop of the Anglican Church; and James Johnson, that fiery intellectual and evangel¬ ist.28 Others included Broughton Davies, who qualified as a doctor in 1859, and Samuel Lewis, the lawyer, the first African to receive a knighthood.29 Liberia also produced a few intellectuals, among whom was Edward Wilmot Blyden, who was born in the West Indies. Slightly larger were the numbers in Nigeria and the Gold Coast. In Nigeria, the elite included people like Essien Ukpabio, D. B. Vincent (later known as Mojóla Agbebi), H. E. Macaulay, G. W. Johnson, R. B. Blaize and J. A. Otunba Payne.30 The Gold Coast elite of the 1870s and 1880s included J. A. Solomon, E.J. Fynn, J. P. Brown, J. de Graft Hayford, A. W. Parker, T. Laing, J. H.

It was the latter, described as the 'aspirant bourgeoisie' by Susan Kaplow,33 who, as will be seen later, pushed the frontiers of retail trade in the Gold Coast, Sierra Leone and Nigeria further and further inland during the period under review. As one report from the Gold Coast put it, by 1850, the young men had gone to reside in the interior as traders and clerks and it was they who were 'causing a great increase in the consumption of the manufactures ofGreat Britain and are widely extending commerce and civilisation amongst the native population'.34 Similar social developments took place in Madagascar and in Central and East Africa. Thus, by the end of the period under review a new rung had been added to the social ladder in Africa, an educated elite which had become divided into a professional class of doctors, ministers, teachers, catechists and agents and an aspirant bourgeoisie or entrepreneur group, as some would prefer to call them, of educated traders and merchants."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Models of African initiatives and reactions', 'content': ""War-weariness and insecurity contributed greatly to the acceptance of British wardship or alliance on the part of several African polities and individuals.

When he ascended the throne in 1894, he seemed to be suspicious of Europeans, mostly missionaries at that time, so he sought to restrict his people's interactions with them. Those among the Baganda who had embraced the Christian faith and who would not obey his orders were put to death as traitors.$^{29}$ Today, Christians regard them as martyrs. Mwanga was, however, violently resisting attempts by British agents to take over his country even though disguised as mission› aries. But his diplomatic ability also became apparent in the way he handled various, often warring religious sects. At one time, he would play the two Christian sects, Catholics and Protestants, against Muslims when he thought the latter were becoming too powerful and therefore threatening his control of the country. At another time, he would ally with Muslims against Catholics or Protestants or both depending on who he thought was dangerous to his rule. Thus, Mwanga was adept at the diplomatic game of divide and rule, a tactic which the colonizing powers were able to use so effectively in controlling Africa. When it was necessary, Mwanga resorted to a revival of some old tradition in an attempt to drive out all foreigners as happened in 1888.$^{30}$ On this occasion, he intended to entice all foreigners and their Baganda followers to a naval parade on an island on Lake Victoria. There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler. Later, however, in 1889, Mwanga managed to regain his throne only to be exiled to Kisimayu, as already indicated, in 1899, where he died in 1903."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Emergence of the Western-educated elite', 'content': 'In Kenya, it was not until the early decades of this century that a significant elite which played an active part in local politics - men like John Owale, R.

The Society would sell shares or land rights offered by African petitioners but only to Afro-American or African purchasers. 4 Bishop Turner also later served as an adviser to the International Migration Society (IMS) of Alabama, which sent about 500 emigrants to Africa before it became defunct in 1900. Some of the 500 remained in Liberia; others returned to the United States. Those who remained fared reasonably well; evidently more than a few of them prospered. On the other hand, those who returned told horror stories of poor land, inadequate food and poor living conditions. These stories reduced the likelihood of any large-scale Afro-American emigration movement, even though prospects for blacks in the United States were declining from 1895 to 1900. Nevertheless, numerous Afro-Americans evidently continued to give serious consider› ation to African emigration, just as others in the United States and the Caribbean simply moved away from overt discriminatory practices into other regions near by.\nAfter the turn of the twentieth century, the back-to-Africa baton was picked up by others. For example, one Captain Dean, early in the twentieth century, hoped to engineer the settlement of American blacks in South Africa to fashion a powerful black state there. After the briefest sojourn meant to arrange for this settlement, however, white authorities expelled Dean from the Cape for what were termed 'provocative activities'. And in 1914, Chief Alfred C. Sam, a Gold Coast African, turned up in Oklahoma, persuaded about sixty black farmers that Africa offered them greater oppor› tunities and sailed with them to Saltpond in the Gold Coast. Finding Chief Sam's claims to be exaggerated and encountering restrictions from the Gold Coast officials which inhibited the entry of American immigrants, most of the Oklahomans eventually returned to the United States.

The Inhambane Tonga and the Sena helped the Portuguese against their respective Shangaan and Barue overlords, while in the Congo a number of subject people co-operated with the Belgians to free themselves from Yeke and Arab rule or from the slave raiders.

At the age of 28, Garvey went to the United States attracted by Washington's work, fired by Duse's example, and armed with a programme of race redemption: the establish› ment of industrial and agricultural schools for blacks in Jamaica, a Black Star fleet of ships for commerce between blacks in Africa and the Americas, and, most of all, a 'central nation for the race'.

CHARLES BUXTON, M.P.—It is scarcely proper that a man so widely known as was Mr. Charles Buxton should pass away without placing on record in our columns some fuller notice of his career than the brief paragraph which appeared in our last impression. The youngest son of the late eminent philanthropist, Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, by a daughter of the house of Gurney, of Norfolk, Mr. Buxton was born at Cromer, in that county, in the year 1823. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he closed his undergraduate course by taking with his B.A. degree a second class in classical honours, together with the mathematical distinction of a junior optime. He did not enter Parliament until the general election of 1857, when he was returned for Newport, in the Isle of Wight, in the Liberal interest, and as a supporter of Lord Palmerston, who had appealed to the country upon his policy with respect to China. Two years later he wooed and won the larger and more important constituency of Maidstone, which he represented for six years without intermission. In 1865, at the general election, he was returned, along with Mr. Locke King, as M.P. for East Surrey, after a very severe struggle, against Mr. H. W. Peek and the Hon. William Brodrick, now Lord Midleton. He was re-chosen at the last general election by a majority of about 400 votes. It will be remembered that Mr. Buxton was an active member of the celebrated \'Jamaica Committee,\' which was engaged in supporting the charges of misgovernment of that island by the governor, Mr. E. J. Eyre; and his labors on this subject both in and out of Parliament will not be readily for-'}, {'id': 2094, 'article_title': 'THE LATE MR.

He was also one of the earliest and most zealous supporters of the Volunteer movement, and was indefatigable in his command as Lieut. Colonel of the 1st Battalion of the Tower Hamlets Rifles. He was a magistrate for his native county and also for that of Surrey, in which he owned a property at Warren, near Weybridge. Mr. Buxton distinguished himself also as a man of letters, being a writer in the Cambridge Essays and reputed contributor to the Saturday Review. The most popular work of his pen, however, is his biography of his distinguished father, on whom fell the mantle of Wilberforce, as the antagonist of the slave trade and the reformer of our penal code. Mr. Buxton himself was a philanthropist, and there was scarcely a measure of educational progress and reform which he did not advocate and support both in and out of Parliament. A handsome tribute was paid to his memory and to his personal worth in the House itself on Friday night by Mr. R. N. Fowler, M.P., who sits on the Opposition benches.

What a host of cherished recollections of the persevering and active devotion of this great champion of the negro slave crowd around us at the mere mention of his name, who first established, after a long and costly struggle before the British tribunals, the absolute and unconditional freedom of every negro slave so soon as his foot touched any portion of the sacred free soil within the four seas of Britain. This was the foundation-stone of the great arch of slave emancipation in British Colonies and of the entire abolition of the African foreign slave-trade, so far as concerns all but Mohammedan States, by whose demand for negro slaves all that now remains of it is kept alive. Suffolk has so much reason to be proud of this great champion of freedom that we are only surprised that so many years have been allowed to roll away before Wisbech could boast of a memorial in his honour. But his memory has lived, and will ever live, in the hearts of those who have sympathised with his efforts, and the efforts of his fellow champions, Buxton and Wilberforce. The time will, no doubt, come when regenerated Africa will do honour to those renowned champions of her long downtrodden races, who, under the instigation of the demon of greed, were made to prey upon each other, and deluge the whole land in blood, for the benefit of the accursed foreign slave-dealer and his employers and patrons.

There are fringes of something like light on some portions of the horizon which give hope of that coming dawn; but the change from darkness to light seems to us very slow; yet would Clarkson, Wilberforce, and Buxton rejoice to see what we now behold, imperfect and feeble though the advance seems to us to be—Negro doctors, negro barristers, members of the London College of Surgeons, and of the Inns of Court; negro editors of newspapers and almanacks, negro merchants and traders, negro catechists and schoolmasters, and over and above all a negro bishop and archdeacon, with many negro pastors and teachers.

On one side spears are the most conspicuous objects, and the variety of type is quite striking. We have spears from Somaliland, the Masai country, the Congo, Uganda, Swaziland, the Nyassa region, the Tanganyika region. Nearly all of these spears, as well as the other exhibits, have been collected by explorers whose names are famous, men like Livingstone, Speke and Grant, Stanley and Thomson, Johnston, and many missionaries; the officials of the Congo Free State, and others. Very varied are the types of axes, many of them of elaborate form. Bows and arrows are not numerous; but shields are plentiful and varied, and it is of interest to note that the Zulu shield extends to the latitude of Zanzibar, where we find a tribe long settled there, and yet retain many of the old Zulu customs. Some of the personal ornaments are most extraordinary. There are anklets like enormous brass plates, with a hole through the centre; others made of bars of copper, each over a pound weight.

One exhibit which will no doubt interest many visitors is the complete equipment for a horse brought by Mr. Thomson from Sokoto.\n\nSome of the objects in the glass cases will probably prove among the most attractive exhibits. There are Livingstone\'s Consular cap and sword, and his simple knife and fork and sugar basin. One of Gordon\'s famous Khartoum notes, lent by Sir H.

Some specimens of the Ashanti gold ornaments are sure to attract attention.\n\nWhat will interest a large section of the public is the abundance of exhibits in the gallery illustrative of missionary effort and the slave trade.

It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown. ""Freetown, with its hills rising behind it, forms a pretty picture from the bay where ships lie at anchor, but the town itself is fairer to behold from a distance than pleasant to inspect closely.

Lovett Cameron, R.N., on ""Africa.""\n\nThe lecturer said that the further British influence extended in Africa the more would slavery of every kind be done away with. Besides illegal slavery, there was extensively practised in Africa a system of native despotism which it was very desirable should be abolished. In 1876 nobody seemed to take any notice of Africa, and the exportation of India-rubber from Zanzibar amounted to something under £20,000. Now the amount was about £250,000! With respect to ill-health in that continent, he had found that some of the native treatments were by no means to be despised, and many of our English doctors could take a leaf out of their book. The record of men who had travelled through Africa and endured every conceivable kind of hardship proved that Africa had been cursed by the idea of its unhealthiness, a reproach which it did not deserve. The great thing required, however, was adequate communication. African travelling, under present circumstances, meant, at the outside, fifty miles in a week. At the present time every mile of railroad laid down in Africa drove a dozen nails into the coffin of the slave-trade, to say nothing of the immense impetus to trade and commerce which would thus be afforded. From Cairo right away to the Albert Nyanza was navigable water. There would be no difficulty in overcoming the obstacles of cataracts, &c., which modern engineering would easily surmount. The central high plateau of Africa was, to a great extent, in British hands, and offered the most important means of repressing the slave-trade in future. Every slave working at the present time was in direct defiance of the Act of 1873. Mr. Rhodes\' great railway, which would reach Zambesia within eight years, should be kept under British control, as native treaties were more or less uncertain. In 1876 they could have obtained all that is now German territory by holding up their hands. The Germans, however, are practically locked in. A dispute had been going on with Portugal as to whether the Zambesi was an open highway. Fortunately, owing to the twenty-one miles strip of land granted by England to Germany these two powers would be as one on the question, and in future arbitration claim the Zambesi as an open highway. A wise system of emigration should be conducted. He would like to see Indian planters transferred there, and Chinese too. Africa offered an excellent opening for the English working man, and it was desirable that the Government should protect its emigrants. The dangers of Africa were largely dwelt on nowadays, and its advantages were put in the rear. This was the reason why the development of that great continent was so far behind hand.\n\nThe following resolution was proposed by Admiral Field, M.P., seconded by Mr. Johnson (of the Stanley Falls, Congo):—', 'last_edit_date': '1890-07-18', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1890#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'To Lord Alfred Churchill President, and the Members of the African-Aid Society', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There can be no better proof that education and trade are making way on the West Coast of Africa than is furnished by the Report of the Postmaster-General for 1864.

I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain. If we gave away the Gold Coasts or Lagos, or the Niger, for instance, in exchange for concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or the North Atlantic, the ratio of loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be far greater than the gain to the Australians or the Newfoundlanders. To those who argue that our missionaries and merchants might go on working in West Africa just the same, even if the rule in our possession were transferred to another Power, I would ask, \'How many British merchants are there in French Senegambia? What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value. Then as to Zanzibar and British East Africa, they, in their turn, besides securing the southern approach to the dominions of our Egyptian ward, are a necessity to the trade and overflow emigration of our great Indian Empire, with its nearly 300,000,000 of people and its yearly trade with the British Empire of some £90,000,000. The trade of the British Empire with British Africa amounts to about £25,200,000 yearly.

Why not use the word ally which is indeed the more appropriate term? Tofa, the king of the Gun kingdom of Porto Novo has always been cited as a typical example of a collaborator. But was he? As Hargreaves has clearly shown,$^{14}$ Tofa was facing three different enemies at the time of the arrival of the French - the Yoruba to the north-east, the Fon kings of Dahomey to the north and the British on the coast - and he must have seen the arrival of the French as a god-sent opportunity for him not only to protect his sovereignty but even to make some gains at the expense of his enemies. He naturally chose, therefore, not to collaborate but to ally with the French. Surely only those historians who are not aware of the problems with which Tofa was confronted at that time, or who deny the African any initiative or an awareness of his own interests, or who see the whole issue from a Eurocentric viewpoint, would describe Tofa as a collaborator. Moreover, the fallacy of this term is further demonstrated by the fact that the socalled collaborators who at some points were prepared to ally with Euro› peans often later became the opposers or resisters of the Europeans: Wobogo, the king of Mossi, Lat Dior, the Darnel of Gayor, and even the great Samori Ture himself are examples of such rulers.

Most of the discussion, if not all of it, has been centred on the dichotomy between resisters, who by implication are to be praised as heroes, and so-called collaborators, who also by implication are to be condemned as traitors. This classification came about as a result of the nationalist struggle for independence in Africa, as elsewhere in the world. Those involved in the movement tended to see themselves as heirs to a long tradition of struggle whose roots go back to the beginning of this century, if not earlier. It was assumed that independence was a good thing and to strive for it was natural. Consequently, all those who had resisted European penetration of Africa, in order to preserve its inde› pendence, were heroes to be emulated and given an honourable place in the histories of the countries that had gained their independence through resistance to colonial rule. Put in these terms, this view is an attempt to use the standards of the present, with the aid of hindsight, to interpret the events of the past. In the colonial situation, those who resisted were described by colonial officials as short-sighted while those who collaborated were seen as far-sighted. Today, nationalist historians in East Africa con› demn so-called collaborators, especially chiefs, and praise resisters. 1\nAmong the resisters, there were also divisions. There were those who took to armed confrontation with the intruders - active resistance. Then there were those who, though they did not take to arms, refused to co› operate with the intruders.

They claimed that it was often the result of 'superstition' and that peoples otherwise content to accept colonial rule had been worked upon by 'witch-doctors'.

The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history.

It was resisted in arms, and much of the support given to the great revolts of the early twentieth century which tried to redefine sovereignty came from men who hated forced labour. It was also resisted by desertion and strikes, by refusal to work underground, by compound riots.

But at least I have so far limited discussion to armed resistance to white invasion or to armed uprisings against colonial rule as it began to 'bite'; the chronological extensions arise from the uneven nature of white advance into Africa and from the still more uneven establish› ment of effective colonial control. Using this essentially political definition the period between 1880 and 1900 emerges as a crucial period of resistance, even if many of the great attempts to redefine sovereignty through protest took place later.\nIf we now turn in conclusion to the developing emphasis on economic resistance, the chronological limits become even less clearly defined. Perhaps the most radical reinterpretation is that of Samir Amin. Amin argues that the really crucial West African resistances to Europe came in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and he dismisses the resist› ances of the Scramble period itself as the half-hearted, rearguard actions of an already compromised ruling class.

He is at present an officer of engineers in the service of El-Hadj-Omar, one of the most powerful sovereigns of Central Africa, and has built fortresses for that prince at Segou, Sikoro, Koundain, and Niora.

There is considerable alarm among the British residents, but fortunately Sir Samuel Rowe, Governor-in-Chief of the West African Settlements, had just arrived from England, and was taking prompt steps to protect British interests. Trade in Gambia is much disturbed; the ground nut crop there this season will not exceed 4,000 tons, or one-fifth of the usual crop, owing principally to internal disturbances, and there will be a very serious decline in the revenue. Later telegrams have been received to the effect that Said Mattei, King of Baddiboo, picked a quarrel with and attacked the King of the Saloum country, which is a few miles north of the Gambia and under the protectorate of the French Government. The Governor of Senegal immediately went to the assistance of the King of Saloum with a regiment of Spahis and a battalion of Marine Infantry, and drove Said Mattei out of his own country.\n\nAs mentioned above, Sir Samuel Rowe has arrived at Bathurst. He has been despatched by the Colonial Office to inquire into the depressed state of trade on the Gambia, and to report on the political aspect of affairs generally in the settlement. The Hon. Gilbert Carter, the acting Administrator, has been detained for a short time, so that Governor Rowe might have the benefit of his local knowledge and advice in the present complicated condition of Gambia affairs.'}, {'id': 6301, 'article_title': 'THE CONGO FREE STATE', 'full_section_title': 'THE CONGO FREE STATE', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1893#article-3', 'issue_date': '01_02_1893', 'content': ""Important news was received from the Congo early in January.

Moharra, the rival of Tippoo Tib and ally of Rumaliza of Ujiji, after denying the agents of the Company of the Upper Congo access to the countries over which he rules, ordered the massacre of Hodister and his companions between Bena Kamba and Kiba Riba. Lieut. Dhanis, after having established and fortified advanced posts on the Lomani above Bena Kamba, has now declared war upon him. The Belgian force is very much smaller than Moharra's, but Lieut.

While French and German expeditions were being organised on either side, the Niger Company last winter despatched an embassy to the Sultan of Bornou to find out by personal negotiations what attitude he is prepared to assume towards the entire wave of European influence which is approaching his empire from the west. The expedition, about 300 strong, was under the command of the Company\'s officer, Mr. Charles Macintosh, who had with him a staff of two or three other Europeans; a part of his convoy consisted of the Houssa troops of the Company, and the remainder was made up of porters bearing food and equipment for the party, together with a liberal supply of presents for the monarch whom it was hoped to propitiate. The whole party were fully armed, but their instructions were to regard themselves as a strictly peaceful mission, and to take every precaution to avoid bloodshed. As the country between the Benue and Lake Tchad was unknown, food was taken for the whole journey. A draft treaty between the Niger Company and the Sultan of Bornou was confided to the diplomatic care of Mr. Macintosh to negotiate if possible. The party left Ribago, on the Benue, in October, and struck in a due northerly direction for Kouka. The distance as the crow flies is something less than 250 miles, not so far as from London to Durham. It was traversed at the rate of ten or twelve miles a day, and after three weeks\' travelling, the expedition arrived at the Court of Bornou. Scientific observations of the country were taken on the way. The natives, from whom nothing was requested, were not otherwise than friendly. At Kouka, which is a considerable town, with a population of about 120,000, and regarded as the western terminus of Mohammedan civilisation in Central Africa, the arrival of Europeans created no small sensation. The Embassy was well received by the Sultan, who assigned it quarters in the town, and was pleased to accept as a preliminary to negotiations some portion of the presents which were offered to him. Two months of Oriental dilly-dally followed, during which time the officers of the Company made use of their opportunity to acquire political and commercial information relating to Bornou and its sister States. Arabs from all quarters thronged about them, and the Houssa language, which is the _lingua franca_ of the Central States, served as a medium of communication. Political factions abound at the Court of Kouka as elsewhere; but the result left in the minds of Mr. Macintosh and his companions after prolonged discussion with the various leaders is that all factions unite in a determination to repel the approach of Western civilisation. Bornou draws all its knowledge of the outer world from the reports of pilgrims and caravans travelling to Mecca and other centres of the East. The Mahdist disturbances in the Soudan, which have forced pilgrims to Mecca, to pass by way of Cairo, have had the effect, as regards Bornou, of keeping it better informed than it was before of the progress of the world\'s affairs, and have contributed to weld it and the neighbouring States more closely to the Eastern and Mohammedan as opposed to the Western and Christian system. The power and influence of Senousism in the Central States have not been, so far as the Niger Mission was able to ascertain, in any sense over-estimated by general report. Religious fanaticism supported by the sword is the prevailing spirit of government in Bornou. A well-established current of trade with the East and long-standing political traditions at present serve to combine all interests against European intrusion. It is neither England nor France nor Germany which is feared, but the European as European, the revolution of steam and enlightenment and liberty as against the camel and ignorance and despotism. The persistence of the European is well known, but while he presents himself in the peaceful guise of a trader only arms will suffice to drive him back. There is not a caravan which comes across the desert that does not bring evidence of the fact that, whether in Egypt, or Tripoli, or Turkey, the European, once admitted, reduces the Oriental to submission. The East has but one story. Bornou is of the East, and it stands in the position of a man who has never tasted wine and who sees his neighbour drunk. He realises all the consequences; he has never experienced the force of the circumstances which have produced them. The Sultan of Bornou and his advisers say in their pride, ""The evil has all come from having dealings with the West.

Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets.

An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river.

Whether things will remain as they now are is the doubtful point; pretexts for occupation are so easily found when wanted that it would be rash to answer. Some tribe is reached who cannot understand dual control; they insist on customs, perhaps; are ""chastised"" by the Consul; they retaliate, and finally an occupation is proclaimed.

The chief of the Christian party managed also to offend the King, and this became the signal for the outbreak of a fresh revolution. The Mohammedans attacked the Christians—who were obliged to flee for their lives, two of the chief among the latter being killed. The Mohammedans, supported by the Arabs, were now in the ascendant, new officers of state were appointed, and the missionaries—both French and English—were cast into prison, being after a few days released, and told to leave the country, with the injunction: ""Let no white man come to Buganda for two years. We do not want to see a white teacher back in Buganda till we have converted the whole people to the Mohammedan faith.""\n\nThere is a lesson to be learnt from this case, and what has lately happened to the German East African Company in Zanzibar. In both cases the Arab traders were the instigators, though in the latter case they seem to have had matters simplified for them by the action of the German East African and Imperial authorities. If it be true that the German ships have occasionally been guilty of promiscuously shelling the coast, ""simply to overawe the natives,"" we can hardly wonder at the influence obtained by these Arab traders. In the ordinary way there is not much reason for this alliance between the natives and the Arabs—as the intercourse of the latter is generally confined to kidnapping and enslaving the former. But the presence of a common enemy is sure to drive them into alliance together. And let us remember the native mind does not grasp the difference between one European power and another. It is not in the interests of the Arab to enlighten them—on the contrary, it is clearly to his advantage to persuade them that all Europeans are bent upon their destruction. The Arab influence in East Africa is already immense. The chief obstacle to its further development lies in the hostility of the native tribes, who have trusted Europeans in preference, because they found that these have been just and considerate; but according to latest accounts, the Germans seem bent upon changing all this, and forcing the natives to make common cause with the Arabs.

After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms.

Rather more than two years ago, an agreement was concluded at Paris between our Government and that of France with regard to the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence in West Africa. The territories referred to in the agreement were Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast. It was provided that the two Governments should have the right of appointing special Commissions of Delimitation ""to trace upon the spot, wherever they may consider it necessary, the line of demarcation between the English and French possessions"" in conformity with the agreement.

For some time past British merchants interested in commerce with Sierra Leone have been apprehensive that their trade with the interior might be seriously interfered with, if not absolutely ruined, by a wrongful definition of the boundary.

The advance made during the closing year relates chiefly to East Africa, where the German East African Company has continued its career of activity. Several additions have been made to the vast region under Germany's protection in that part of the Dark Continent, and, what is more, steps have been taken to accelerate the development of the lands acquired, and to prepare the way for trade. One of the latest East African acquisitions of importance is the Vitu region, the protection of which has been arranged by the German Colonial Association; but since this land was secured the East African Company has added to its possessions, the fresh acquisition taking in Port Durnford and a considerable stretch of coastland. Steps are now being taken to form a plantation company which will carry on operations in East Africa, and will cultivate tobacco, cotton, cocoa, &c. As yet great difficulty has been experienced in regard to the labour question. The natives are well behaved, but they do not show any inclination to work unless for the satisfaction of immediate needs, and directly these needs are covered, they betake themselves to idleness.

To this cause, principally, may be attributed the popularity of propositions for the immediate occupation of vast areas of Central Africa. Two minor causes have contributed to this movement.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains.

In practice, the consuls, especially after 1850, continued and stepped up a policy started in the 1830s by Edward Nicolls, Governor of Fernando Po, of signing treaties with the local chiefs.$^{6}$ These treaties stipulated the stoppage of the slave trade by the rulers; the adoption of 'legitimate trade', that is, trade in goods other than slaves; laid down regulations for the conduct of legitimate trade; specified the sums of customs duties or comey to be paid by the traders, as well as subsidies that the British government was to pay the local rulers for their agreement to give up the slave trade.\nThese British activities on the coast gradually eroded the power of the local rulers, especially when the consuls and naval officers assisted the British traders to set up their own judicial systems over and above the law of the local states, the so-called Courts of Equity, composed mainly of British traders with the participation of a few local House Heads or chiefs.

The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated.

Although it gave poor returns, trade other than in slaves developed in parallel and not in competition with the slave trade. The competition was between the Western nations, and they eventually arrived at an informal apportionment of spheres of economic interest to which African rulers did not object. France was predominant north of Sierra Leone and at some points on the Ivory Coast and in Gabon, where she set up Libreville in imitation of Freetown. 43 Americans and Europeans came to the coast and were tolerated in what was in effect a British economic enclave.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service.

In some cases the dominant class emerged stronger as a result of economic and military ties to the slave-traders. Consider relations between the Bemba rulers and the Arab and Swahili traders. Under the leadership of Chileshe Chipela the Bemba had just completed a phase of territorial expansion and political centralization when the foreign traders entered their homeland around i860. As a result, the Bemba kingdom was far more unified and powerful than most states in the region. The geographical position of the Bemba, somewhat removed from the principal trade routes, precluded the growth of a large and potentially seditious merchant community within the core of their kingdom. Equally important, there was no incentive for the Arab and Swahili traders to adopt a hostile posture since the Bemba were not economic rivals. Most of the royal families' wealth came from raiding and tribute in the form of ivory and slaves and they were happy to exchange them for the cloth and other imported goods provided by the coastal merchants. This economic complementarity fostered a harmonious relationship and simultaneously enhanced the internal position of the Bemba aristocracy, which used the foreign commodities to recruit new followers and strengthen their links to subordinate chiefs. The continued demand for captives and ivory also fuelled a new expansionist phase from i860 to 1880, during which Bemba forces conquered most of contemporary north-eastern Zambia. Thus, through ties to foreign merchants, the Bemba rulers gained unprecedented regional power while accumulating a substantial amount of wealth. 43 As in the case of the Bemba, other local chiefs and merchants entered into alliances with the slave-traders that proved extremely beneficial. Throughout the 1870s the Chewa chief, Mwase Kasungu, whose territory straddled the Lake Malawi-Katanga trade route, provided food for the Arab caravans in exchange for guns.

If they were less farsighted, less fortunate or less well-advised, they would see their traditional enemies siding with the invader and would themselves assume an attitude of resistance, which could all too easily end in military defeat, the deposition of chiefs, the loss of land to the native allies of the occupying power, possibly even to the political fragmen› tation of the society or state ...

Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

They paid little for produce and charged relatively high prices for imported goods. The experience of Latin American peasants is quite relevant here.\nA further obstacle to the commercial development of the smallholders' economy is the marketing mechanism. On account of the contractual inferiority of the peasant, and the usual concentration of three com› mercial functions in the hands of single individuals (purchaser of produce, supplier of credit and vendor of consumption goods), any surpluses developed by the little economy tend to be transferred to the middleman rather than remain available for reinvestment. 77 In settler-dominated areas, for example Southern Rhodesia, it 'became customary for European landowners to market their tenants' produce, and often that of neighbouring peasants as well',$^{78}$ a practice which minimized African competition and assured the settler of a semi-monopolistic position."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Marketing', 'content': ""Certainly, until the early 1930s, the tendency was to encourage whoever was likely to contribute in this respect.

The 'dislike and distrust of the Levantine communities' in West Africa, which Professor Bauer noticed to be 'marked in official circles', 71 was a relatively recent development. Real hostility towards the Levantines, mostly Lebanese, came not from official circles but from the various European agents of commercial firms, and such hostility was in response to effective trade rivalry presented by the Levantines.$^{72}$ And where British firms appear to have been given preference, it was not because of their respectability, but because they could - with the blessing of the British government - act as effective pressure groups and influence colonial policy› makers. 73 Still, Ehrlich's generalization that 'administrative attitudes, throughout British Africa, rarely encouraged indigenous commercial initiative'$^{74}$ is quite valid. But other factors stifled local initiatives. First of all, general official policy, as would be expected in a colonial situation, was geared primarily towards the advancement of imperialist interests. Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction. By the first decade of the twentieth century, following the construction of railways, European firms were squeezing African traders in two related ways. Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

The Owu being driven out, the Ibadans, who had then no home, thought it wise to inhabit the desolated country. Since their settlement therein they have become a terror to the surrounding countries. Plunderers and kidnappers, they would not work, but have made the slave-trade their chief business. Having been unable to succeed against the Egbas, whom they once attacked in concert with Ijebu and Ife, some of whose land they now inhabit, they have swooped down upon the Ijesha land, whose people are noted for their agricultural activity, and who also hate war as Christians would to sin. They have taken possession of the Ijesha territory. The majority of the people have been driven to the bush through the heavy taxes laid upon them; the king (Owa) had been mercilessly massacred, and thrown into the famous river called ""O Sun,"" and the remnant of the people in the country are regarded as their fortune, for there is not an Ejinrin or Ikorudu market in which the sons and daughters of the soil are not to be found as one of the articles for speculation; besides which, many of them are daily purchased by the cruel King of Dahomey, to be offered in sacrifice at his ""customs.""\n\nOur fathers here, seeing the wretched condition in which their country is placed, carried their sorrowful complaints to the Queen\'s representative—viz., Capt.

In our leader of last month we wrote: ""If all the circumstances, however, as reported to us in the various letters we have received should be proven before the Supreme Court, we must state it as our conviction, that the claims of justice will not be by any means fully satisfied in a conviction and adequate punishment of the chief offender, the accused master of the King Docemo."" We then alluded to the statements made to us that the said steamer was chartered by one Captain Croft, on account of Messrs. Miller Brothers and Co.; that this Captain Croft went up the Niger in the King Docemo, that he was on board her when the foul occurrence took place, and must have witnessed, and been cognizant of, the entire proceedings, which ended so fatally for the poor African. We added, that we were not willing to believe that this could be true, that those enormities could have taken place in the presence of Captain Croft, because we would not believe that there could be another Englishman so equally debased with Shankling as to calmly witness such enormities, and allow them to proceed to their full completion in murder. But unless the evidence on which Mr. Justice Woodcock relied was false, we must now with equal reluctance admit that we were mistaken. According to that evidence, Croft was in the steamer; Croft did not only witness the punishment of the African, but suggested (where suggestion was command) that it should be inflicted; and it was Croft, who, as superior in command, ordered the punishment to be continued even when the danger of the man falling overboard was pointed out, and who continued the steamer on her course when he did fall overboard, without making, or ordering to be made, any effort whatever to save the drowning victim. So strong were the observations of Mr. Justice Woodcock in charging the jury, that we are now bound to believe all this to have been proved in evidence, and that the presiding Judge believed that evidence to be true and trustworthy. We must refer our readers to the account of the trial, signed ""A Juror,"" for those observations of Mr. Justice Woodcock which bear so strongly upon Captain Croft. If the Judge and the jury have been misled, the sooner Captain Croft sets this matter right with the Lagos Supreme Court, the better. The words reported to have been used by Mr. Justice Woodcock seem to us to place Croft in a position of no slight danger. The man who was drowned was, as a native of, and resident in, Lagos at the time he was buried, a British subject, and entitled to the protection of British laws. We do not know whether the steamer when in the River Niger would be considered as on the high seas, although we think that, as being out of all local civilized jurisdiction, she would be so considered. A case reported at Bow-street Police-court, in this city, on Saturday, November 24, seems to establish that crimes of violence on board a British ship in the River Niger can be tried and punished in London. (See note at foot of this article.) There can be no doubt that had Captain Croft been in Lagos, Mr. Justice Woodcock would have ordered his immediate apprehension on a charge of manslaughter or murder; and Captain Croft can scarcely allow Mr. Justice Woodcock to continue in this error if the evidence on which it has been founded was false. We, at least, feel it to be so serious a charge against Captain Croft, and so serious an accusation to be hanging over him, that, although we have no knowledge of him, and know nothing of him beyond the fact of his having been engaged in the African trade and in responsible positions for many years, we offer our columns for any statement he may feel inclined to make touching this deplorable matter. With regard to William Shankling, we are informed that efforts were, or are, being made to obtain his pardon. Unless there be some disculpating evidence of which we are up to this time ignorant, we must say that we shall be extremely sorry to hear that such efforts were successful. Something must be done to establish the value of African life on board English vessels on the West Coast of Africa. Something must be done to counteract and put an end to the long-prevailing opinion that African life may be disposed of by masters of trading vessels and other Englishmen in responsible employments on the West Coast, as a thing respecting which no inquiry will be made, no questions be asked, no responsibility be incurred. The British Government have done much for Africa and the Africans, and must effect this change also. We hear but too often of cruelties and violence that are inflicted in the wantonness of power, under the prevailing tradition and opinion that Africans are beings out of the pale of humanity, and may be kicked, cuffed, flogged, mutilated, and even killed with impunity. All this must be changed if civilization is to progress in Africa. The past may have had some shadow of excuse, although it never could have had any justification, in the cruelties practised by African masters upon African slaves, by Africans upon Africans, at the instigation of Fetish priests and the behests of diabolical superstition. Human sacrifices and cannibal feasts have but too widely demonized the populations. But those who profess Christianity, and therefore to be guided and governed more or less by the precepts and commands of the Divine Founder of their faith, are bound to set a different example; and where they ignore this duty, they ought, so far as British power can be made to extend, to be compelled to do so. We hear from all quarters that the steamers of the West Africa Company are navigated, and the trading operations of the Company are carried on up the River Niger with an entire absence of those excesses which have so foully disgraced the British name, committed by masters and agents on board other trading ships and steamers, and on shore. A letter that appears in our present number affords lamentable evidence in this direction, and shows that those who practise brutality to Africans become themselves so profoundly brutalized by practice, that even European life loses its sacredness in their eyes; and every feeling of humanity towards helpless and suffering dependents is wantonly outraged, even to the extent of what the law would condemn as \'manslaughter or murder.\' We can only express our regret that we are not so supported in our efforts by the educated among the African community, as to enable us to fight with greater effect this great battle for the sacredness of African human life.'}, {'id': 4190, 'article_title': 'SOMETHING DONE AT LAST: SOMETHING LEFT UNDONE.', 'full_section_title': 'SOMETHING DONE AT LAST: SOMETHING LEFT UNDONE.', 'last_edit_date': '02-28-1881', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1881#article-10', 'issue_date': '01_04_1881', 'content': 'The notorious robber chief, Fody Cubba, has for over two years ravaged the Jolah country, plundering every one, killing the old men and women in each town he has taken, selling the young people into slavery, and transporting the pick of the young men up to Cuboo country, to his son there, to be trained as warriors.

But for the taxation of the commerce, it might be imagined that no ""protection"" exists. The unwisdom of handing us over to their care may be seen in the case of Landana; yet I would not say that matters can remain precisely as at present. The old arrangement, to which both natives and traders were accustomed, was, on the whole, satisfactory. But the ""Congo question"" having been manufactured by Portugal, France, and the Belgian Expedition—so-called ""International""—it is necessary that something should be done. There is one way to which all the whites here would give their approval. Let an International Board of Control be established to settle all disputes where their interference was desirable; guarantee the neutrality of the river and its territories; and empower the Board to summon, if requisite, the aid of any of the gunboats stationed on the coast. The Board, of course, would have to be constituted of men who know the district practically, and might be depended upon to decide matters in accordance with established usage.

For years these have been at war with each other, with the results that trade has been very much interfered with and the country impoverished. Colonel Niven, Administrator-in-Chief, attended by request of the parties to witness the signing of the treaty of peace between Lahai Bundoo and Gbannah Lehrey, two powerful chiefs, who had been at war with each other for a long time past. Various Consuls were present, and a guard of honour of 200 men of the 1st West India Regiment also attended. The treaties stipulated that the various parties would act peaceably towards each other, and that in the event of any disputes arising the matters should be referred to the British Governor at Sierra Leone, whose decision would be final. There were some 300 chiefs, present with their headmen, &c., and it is expected that the meeting will put an end to the numerous quarrels and conflicts which have occurred in this district. After the proceedings a number of English and other traders addressed a letter to Colonel Niven, requesting him to allow Day Mauro, King of Bullom, and Allimany Sawassi, Chief Medina, to go up to Fort Hokkoh to settle a war then going on between two powerful chiefs and their followers.

Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets. Ja Ja was made prisoner by Consul Johnstone, and carried off to Accra. An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river.

Unfortunately, the traders and merchants considered that the independence of the chiefs was more for their benefit than the establishment of British rule; that the influence of the British Consul, backed up by an occasional gunboat, was sufficient to prevent any serious difficulties; and that the treaties with the chiefs secured trade on profitable and equitable terms.\n\nUnder the old régime large fortunes were made, but competition has now much reduced the profits, while German and French annexations have closed some districts to Englishmen and seriously injured their interests in others. In the days that were gone, the courts of equity, formed of the principal merchants, used, with the assistance of the British Consul or the captain of a man-of-war, to smooth all local disputes, settle prices, and generally make regulations for the conduct of trade. Whilst all the merchants were English this system acted very well, although no doubt at times considerable difficulties arose.\n\nForeign competition has sprung up now to a very considerable extent, most of it being in the hands of Germans, and the way that the trade has passed into their hands is not creditable to the foresight or patriotism of English merchants. Even when trade was conducted at more remunerative rates than at present, the scale of pay to clerks and subordinates was not sufficiently high to induce men of education and standing to face the risks of the African climate, and separate themselves from their families and the comforts of civilization for lengthened periods; and in consequence, among those who went to the coast, there were some men whose ideas of commercial morality were at a very low ebb.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-11-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_11_1885#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the present time, from all parts of the West African coast, we have reports of troubles and disturbances, which must hamper trade and retard the commercial and civilising development of that part of the Dark Continent.

The British administration in West Africa has been by no means free from faults in the past; and these faults have born their natural fruit.

The conduct of the masters and seamen of these trading vessels was often outrageous. The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment. With the missionaries it can be imagined how these ruffians came in conflict; and so angry were they at the prospect of the missionaries protecting their victims, or interfering with them, that they bribed and frightened the native chiefs, and used every effort to prevent the missionaries obtaining any hold on the country. The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

Up to the signing of this treaty all persons wishing to trade in any particular river had first of all to get the permission of the king and chiefs; when this permission was granted, the trader was allowed to anchor his vessel or moor his hulk opposite to the town where the king and chiefs have their ""business residences,"" and who acted as agents or middlemen between the European trader and the natives in all business transactions. Every European trader had his favourite native middleman, but as the latter were uncertain in their business allegiance, many riots took place, especially when an extra ""dash"" or ""top side"" was promised by another trader to the middleman if he transferred his custom to his ship. Another bad feature of the middleman system was the competition of the representatives (mostly inexperienced youths) of the merchants at home in giving the middlemen unlimited credit. As long as the middleman returned from the markets with produce to the value of the goods received, the system worked well enough; but a system of rivalry sprang up between the merchants\' representatives, with the result that goods were forced upon the middlemen on trust, with instructions to bring them oil at any price, and the middlemen, seeing their advantage in such general orders, ""feathered their own nests,"" explaining that they had in turn to give trust to their customers at the market; and the greatest trouble an agent whose time has expired on the coast now has is to square up his trust! In this connexion I may say that under the middleman system the European trader had not the remotest idea what the middleman paid for the produce at the market. Those gentry agreed amongst themselves the value they would put upon the puncheon of oil, the cwt. of ebony, or cwt. of kernels, &c., and the writer has been informed by one of the chiefs, confidentially, that the price paid at market is generally one-half of that charged to the European trader. It will be seen that under this system the European was entirely at the mercy of the middleman, who pleased himself whether he would or would not go to market, and it is well known to coasters that the middleman always discountenanced the bringing into market of a superabundance of produce. Now all this is changed, thanks to the treaty; the European trader can personally attend the market and trade with the producer direct, saving the middleman\'s profit, and encouraging the natives to increase the supply, which is inexhaustible, and which will be an easy matter when they see the increase in price which the European will be enabled to pay.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1888#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'If we have not parted with the energy and resolution which, as a Government and people, have characterised us of old, if we shall frame and carry out a sensible, settled policy in these regions, yielding to no sentimental clamour from false philanthropists, nor ignoring the just rights of the natives and our responsibility towards them as their guardians and instructors, we shall make of Western Africa another India, equally worthy of renown and equally profitable to our trade.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH TRADE WITH WESTERN AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '**BRITISH TRADE WITH WESTERN AFRICA.**\n\n**Mr. Alvan Millson**, Assistant Colonial Secretary for the Colony of Lagos, delivered an address recently before the members of the African Trade Section of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce on the subject of Yorubaland.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1891#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True
1628,African natives demonstrated agency and influence in colonial West Africa through thoughtful treaty negotiations with British colonial powers.,"The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that African natives demonstrated agency and influence in colonial West Africa through thoughtful treaty negotiations with British colonial powers. The General History of Africa highlights that African rulers strategically entered into treaties with European powers for various reasons, such as gaining political advantages over neighbors, renouncing allegiance to other African states, or preserving independence from other European nations. This strategic engagement underscores the agency and strategic thinking of African leaders. The textbook also notes the diverse strategies employed by different African states, such as the Yoruba's choice of submission and the kingdom of Benin's preference for confrontation, further illustrating their active participation in shaping their political and economic landscapes. However, it also acknowledges that these treaties often led to the erosion of sovereignty and were sometimes used by European powers for bargaining purposes, indicating limitations to the influence African leaders could exert. Similarly, The African Times articles provide evidence of agency through numerous treaties with native chiefs in regions like Sierra Leone and the Gambia, which were entered into with great consideration and rarely broken, reflecting a commitment from the natives. The articles also describe the involvement of natives in negotiations, such as the Jebu representatives influencing trade routes and the Niger Company's treaties with Ilorin, negotiated by both colored and white diplomatic agents. Nonetheless, the articles also highlight challenges, such as instances where treaties were repudiated or not honored, suggesting complexities in the natives' agency and influence. Together, these sources provide a nuanced view of African agency in treaty negotiations, acknowledging both their active participation and the constraints imposed by colonial powers.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that support the claim that African natives demonstrated agency and influence in colonial West Africa through treaty negotiations with British colonial powers.

Overall, the textbook provides evidence of African agency in treaty negotiations, aligning with the claim, but also highlights the constraints imposed by colonial powers.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that African natives demonstrated agency and influence in colonial West Africa through thoughtful treaty negotiations with British colonial powers. The articles mention numerous treaties with native chiefs, such as those in Sierra Leone and the Gambia, which were entered into with great consideration and were rarely broken, indicating a level of agency and commitment from the natives. Additionally, the articles describe a treaty with the Jebu representatives, highlighting the natives' involvement in negotiations and their ability to influence trade routes. The mention of the Niger Company's treaties with Ilorin, negotiated by both colored and white diplomatic agents, further illustrates the natives' active participation in treaty-making processes. However, the articles also highlight instances where treaties were repudiated or not honored, such as the Jebu treaty, suggesting complexities in the natives' agency and influence.

These treaties took two forms - those between Africans and Europeans, and bilateral agreements between the Europeans themselves. The African-European treaties were basically of two kinds. Firstly, there were the slave trade and the commercial treaties; these had generated friction, which in turn led to European political interference in African affairs. Secondly, there were the political treaties by which African rulers either purportedly surrendered sovereignty in return for protection, or undertook not to enter into treaty obligations with other European nations.\nThese political treaties were in vogue during our period. They were made either by representatives of European governments or by those of private organizations who later transferred them to their respective govern› ments. If a metropolitan government accepted them, the territories in question were usually annexed or declared a protectorate; if, on the other hand, it suspected their authenticity, or if it felt constrained by the vicissi› tudes of Weltpolitik to exercise caution, these treaties were used for bargaining purposes during the bilateral European negotiations. Africans, on the other hand, entered into these arrangements for a variety of motives, but particularly because of the interests of their people. In some cases, they desired treaty relations with Europeans because they hoped that the prestige of such a relationship would endow them with certain political advantages in dealing with their neighbours. Sometimes a weak African state would desire a treaty with a European power in the hope of using it to renounce allegiance to another African state that claimed sovereignty over it. An African sovereign would also desire a treaty in the hope of using it to keep recalcitrant subject states in line. And sometimes a treaty with one European nation was seen by some African states as a means of preserving their independence which was being threatened by other European nations.$^{42}$ Whatever was the case, the African-European political treaties played an important role in the final partition of Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'Conquest and reaction in British West Africa, 1880-1900 > Southern Nigeria', 'content': ""While the Yoruba, by and large, chose the strategy of submission, the rulers of the kingdom of Benin and some of the rulers of the states of the Niger Delta chose that of confrontation.

This, of course, would not be tolerated in that age, and using the killing of the British acting consul-general and five other Englishmen on their way to Benin as an excuse, the British launched a punitive expedition of 1500 men against Benin in 1897. Though the Oba himself would have liked to submit, a majority of his chiefs raised an army to beat back the invasion. They were, however, defeated and the capital was looted of its precious bronze treasures and then burnt. 48 In the Niger Delta, as in many other areas of Nigeria, the British had signed treaties of protection with most of the chiefs by 1884. However, while some, like Calabar and Bonny, had allowed missionaries to operate in their states, others had not. Moreover, all of them were insisting on their sovereign rights to regulate trade and to levy duties on British traders. This, the new British consuls, such as Hewett and Johnston, would not tolerate. A typical example of the rulers who stood up to the British consuls and missionaries was Jaja of Opobo (see Plate 6.3). He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order. When Jaja still refused to comply in spite of Johnston's threats to bombard his town with British gunboats, Johnston enticed Jaja on board a ship in 1887 under a promise of safeconduct but arrested him and sent him to Accra$^{49}$ where he was tried and deported to the West Indies.

The rulers of Nembe (Brass), lying on the main Nun estuary of the Niger, were involved in quarrels between exploring and trading British expeditions and local peoples from the 1830s when British citizens got killed or shot at. The final showdown came in 1895, when the Nembe attacked the major depot of the Royal Niger Company at the port of Akassa and destroyed it. This was in protest against the Company's attempt to establish monopoly trade all the way up from Akassa in the delta to Lokoja at the Niger-Benue confluence.

Encouraged by Porto Novo itself, a French protectorate was declared over this coastal Aja state in 1863 to check further British advance along the coast to the west.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press.

In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.\nIn the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium.

He says: ""Ilorin, unfortunately for the interests of the colony of Lagos, is within the sphere of influence of the Niger Company, though, so far as I am aware, the Company has never taken any steps to make this influence felt in any practical manner. No white official has ever been permitted to pay a visit to Ilorin from the Niger Company, except this merit can be claimed by a gentleman who entered the town with his face blacked and in Mahomedan costume, and in this fashion had an interview with the Emir, who would not have been permitted by his people to publicly receive a white man.""\n\nIf, on the one hand, Sir Gilbert Carter is referring only to the town of Ilorin, his mistake probably arises from the fact that the Niger Company\'s first treaty with Ilorin, on April 1885, was negotiated by Mr. M. Benson Nicol, one of the numerous coloured diplomatic agents who have rendered such remarkable services to British interests in the Niger territories since the commencement of the ""scramble for Africa,"" just as the well-known coloured traveller, Mr. Fergusson, has rendered distinguished political service to the British colony of the Gold Coast. Sir Gilbert Carter appears, however, to be unaware that the second treaty with Ilorin, of the 9th of August 1890, was publicly negotiated in the town of Ilorin by Mr. Watts, a white gentleman who holds the post of executive officer for those regions, and who was received by the reigning Emir and his chiefs with the greatest cordiality.\n\nIf, on the other hand, Sir Gilbert Carter is referring to the country of Ilorin, and not only to the town, I must point out that it has been repeatedly travelled over by the officials of the company, including, amongst others, Captain Lugard, that officials of the company are now moving about Ilorin, and that a fort occupied by a considerable force and commanded by an officer in her Majesty\'s Service was established in Ilorin territory in the early part of this year.'}]","[{'document_title': 'The Niger and Territories on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have been requested to publish the following correspondence:—\n\n""Chamber of Commerce, Manchester, Nov. 2, 1883.\n\n""My Lord,—In November last year this Chamber addressed to your lordship a memorial praying that the earnest endeavours of Her Majesty\'s Government might be directed towards promoting a friendly understanding with other European Governments in order that the sovereign and territorial rights of the natives of the Congo River, and of the adjacent territories on the West Coast of Africa, might be respected and maintained, and that there should be no interference on the part of any Power with the existing freedom of navigation and commerce.\n\n""The attention of other European nations is now being devoted to the extension of commerce, and to the increasing importance, not only of the Congo, but also of the Niger and other rivers, which are the principal means of communication and of trade with the populous tribes in the centre of Africa, and there is reason to fear that they are seeking to annex territories, and also to secure such concessions from native rulers as may enable them to put a hindrance to that freedom of trade and navigation which has hitherto been enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa.\n\n""Your lordship has recently been informed of certain proceedings of French officers on the Niger and the Bonny, and other rivers and places on the African coast, which call for the serious consideration of Her Majesty\'s Government.

Of his enemies the most powerful was Oko Jumbo, who lost no opportunity to humiliate him. The Europeans could only let matters take their course; they regretted constant fighting of Oko Jumbo and Ja Ja, but the relations between the Europeans and natives being strictly commercial, nothing could be done. Suffering reverses, Ja Ja was forced to fly with the remnant of his people after great slaughter at the hands of Oko Jumbo.

The British protectorate, as you are aware, is extended over a large portion of the Coast of Africa, which stretches from the settlement of Sierra Leone to the district of the Niger. Upon this coast, excluding the State of Liberia and the neighbourhood of Whydah, the port of Dahomey, there are three French settlements—viz., Grand Bassam, Assinie, and Porto Novo; also portions of coast unprotected by any European Power. West of Grand Bassam there is unoccupied coast of considerable extent; east of Lagos, beyond Leckie, and reaching to Old Calabar, there is the important territory at the mouths of the Niger. Quite recently the Germans have taken certain ports on this coast—viz., Ahgweh, Bageida, and Little Popo. At these there was a thriving and increasing British trade, and with the chiefs of Ahgweh and Little Popo treaties had been made on behalf of Her Majesty, securing the right of British subjects to trade on equal terms with those of any other nation. The occupation by France and the late annexations by Germany break the continuity of the British protectorate; there is an increasing conflict of the various national interests, and the influence of the British authorities with the natives is being lessened; the introduction of different principles of trading will also seriously affect the prosperity of British commerce. It is important to mention in this connexion that the duties upon spirits, arms, and ammunition levied in the British settlements furnish the greater portion of the Government revenue. In German and French settlements these articles are known, in most cases, to be free of duty, and being sold to a great extent in the same markets as the British imports, competition becomes difficult, and the loss to the British revenue and trade must ultimately be great. The Chamber would suggest, therefore, that while negotiations regarding African territories are pending, something might be done in the way of exchange or by mutual concession to induce Germany, at least, to withdraw from those newly acquired ports where British trade had become established, and where German rivalry upon different principles is likely to be so injurious. This Government might also be requested to take into consideration the question of the extension of the British protectorate to the unprotected portion of the coast named.—I am, &c.,\n\n""C. B.

One is a survey of the Oil Rivers Protectorate, furnished by an evidently well-informed correspondent of the London *Times*, on the occasion of Major McDonald and his staff sailing to inaugurate the new administration over 350 miles of seaboard and a large but undefined region inland. The other document is the Report of the Annual Meeting of the Royal Niger Company, describing the progress of settlement in their Niger territories. It is estimated that no less than half-a-million square miles are covered by their treaties or reserved to their influence by international arrangements. Both of these documents are interesting reading, as they speak hopefully and with justifiable confidence of development and progress. It may not be amiss to point out that, owing to the relative positions of these two British possessions, and the long frontier line which they have in common, the future of both largely depends on their administrators working together harmoniously for the common good. There is every reason to believe that this harmony will be maintained. Major McDonald has given many solid proofs of his capacity and tact; while the Niger Company have not only shown great administrative ability, but have successfully lived down the violent and, as it proves, unjustified attacks which were at one time made upon their policy and conduct. Major McDonald has a fine field open to him in the Oil Rivers Protectorate, which possesses a valuable and long-established trade, and can, therefore, with moderate taxation, yield a sufficient revenue for administration and development. We venture to hope that he will follow the example of the Niger Company in one particular—by largely using coloured agents in dealing with the native tribes. It is well known that some of the most useful work of the Company has been done by their numerous coloured officials. These have, when opportunity offered, ...\n\nproved the capacity of their race, and amply justified the statemanlike policy of the Company in setting aside the absurd prejudices which have elsewhere hampered progress and civilisation.

The members of the deputation seem to have been imperfectly acquainted with the later developments of French activity in the regions under discussion, and not to have realized the force of the successive treaties by which the political spheres of the two countries have been gradually enclosed within geographical limits. Yet the negotiations between the two Governments which led up to the treaty of last year have been from time to time made public in all essential points. That treaty was intended to form the last link of a chain of agreements which should simplify the relations of the two Powers in that part of Africa, and it is now too late to urge the extension of our political influence into a sphere which has been assigned to France. It is impossible, in territories where the frontier is still vague, for one civilised Government to refuse to acknowledge treaties submitted to it by another on the ground that native signatories of the treaty desire to repudiate it. If such a principle were admitted the only result would be a speedy return to the primitive reign of force. Peaceful agreements with native chiefs would have no meaning, and the civilisation of barbarous countries must be preceded by military occupation.

The territories referred to in the agreement were Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast.

The work of determining the boundary line between Senegambia and Sierra Leone is now about to be begun, the British Commissioners having left Liverpool on Saturday last. For some time past British merchants interested in commerce with Sierra Leone have been apprehensive that their trade with the interior might be seriously interfered with, if not absolutely ruined, by a wrongful definition of the boundary.

The conduct of the masters and seamen of these trading vessels was often outrageous. The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment.

The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

The chance was postponed, and now Samadu has placed his kingdom under the protection of France. The colony of Lagos is the sole plantation at which Mr. Johnston can glance without vexation. There, though the Government delays to move the front of the harbour, and though official supineness is answerable for the interposition of wedges of foreign territory between Lagos and the Gold Coast, the spirit of English enterprise is seen. Trade has advanced by leaps and bounds. The settlement in its first year, 1862-3, counted it as £329,479; and in 1887 it was £906,812. He would hesitate to put limits to the prosperity and importance of the place. Yet nothing has been effected at Lagos which could not have been accomplished in Gambia and Sierra Leone. The blame for the shortcomings to be discovered in British West Africa he does not attribute to British traders. The community engaged in conducting mercantile undertakings in West Africa he characterises as a set of genial, good-hearted Englishmen, sagacious and just in their dealings. Of the officials he also speaks in complimentary language. British West Africa has ceased to be a refuge for ruined spendthrifts, of whom their families rejoiced to rid themselves. West African Governors of the present type instruct the natives in the vegetable riches of their own land, and the acclimatisation of useful foreign plants, and they cultivate a fashion among their staffs of learning the native languages. In the past the lethargy which kept British West Africa back, and invited European competition, was universal. Public opinion at home is still far from being alive to the magnitude of the prospects in West Africa, and to the ignorance and inertness which threaten to mar and cloud them."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In all the coast region between the Gambia and the Cameroons the most extravagant development of tropical vegetation is seen. The great future wealth of the interior plateaux will certainly lie in their mineral deposits, the riches of the West Coast region lie in its numerous and valuable vegetable products, of which the most striking are palm oil, and ground nuts, benniseed, shea butter, rubber, gums, spices, cotton, dyes, and valuable timbers, among which ebony occupies a prominent place. With regard to animal products, I might mention ivory and monkey skins. Whereas some of the great races of the interior speak languages which connect them with the Hamitic and Semitic families. The native inhabitants of the West Coast are all that there is of most typically Negro in character; yet I do not mean they are races of particularly low development; on the contrary, the typical Negro is a fine specimen of man, and is by no means as low in his mental state as the races of Polynesia and America. I may cite the Kru tribes of that portion of West Africa which is known as Liberia, a country inhabited by an industrious, energetic, hardworking, stalwart population of free men. An element of heterogeneous ex-slave settlers among the tribes of the coast may be found in some parts of the Colonies of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos. These people represent the Nemesis which invariably follows national crimes. We and our American children indulged to a greater extent than any other European nation in the African slave trade, and, as our wrong-doing was violent and exaggerated, so to a certain extent was the abrupt reparation which followed. Although I would not minimise the work done by our blockade on the West Coast, the abolition of the slave trade was more effectually brought about by the abolition of slavery in the United States of America. One result of our suppression of the slave trade in West Africa has not been altogether advantageous. I refer to the Slave Colonies established at Sierra Leone, and at Fernando Po and other points on the coast. It may be taken that the slaves exported from any district are the least worthy people in it, and the result is that a large proportion of this population is descended from the sweepings of West Africa, and has not yet passed through sufficient generations to eliminate the ancestral badness of its progenitors. So, although here and there a negro has shown what the race can attain to under favourable circumstances, still the bulk of the ""S\'a Leone"" people who are scattered up and down the coast are of an undesirable character, and the cause of indiscriminating blame on the part of superficial observers which is most unjustly laid on the shoulders of the entire population of West Africa; whereas many of these races are superior in intelligence, enterprise, and integrity to any of our negro fellow-subjects in South Africa or the West Indies. What admirable recruits to civilised society can be obtained from many of these people may be instanced by such men as Bishop Crowther, Archdeacons Johnson and Crowther, Samuel Lewis, and other divines and lawyers and officials in West Africa, who are on a par with well-educated white men, and in some cases superior in intelligence and acquirements to the whites with whom they come in contact. It is absurd, however, to regard the Negro race, as a whole, on the same average level as the European—they are far below us. Take them in their native wilds, and they are what we were before Julius Caesar landed in this country; indeed, in many cases they are not 2,000 years behind us, but 10,000. They are in the condition of some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and Gaul, and Spain, whose history we can dimly spell out from their implements and scattered remains, who were undoubtedly cannibals and probably naked, and leading a brutish life. Yet we can in a few years drag them from the condition that prevailed 2,000 years before Christ into the year of grace 1889. We can take a cannibal from the Upper Cross River, and transport him to the centres of civilisation in England or America, where everything represents the utmost result of our present development; but what will be usually the result both with the individual and the race? The savage mind will be unable to grasp and assimilate one-third of the wonders presented to his consideration, and will probably even suffer from the shock. We cannot expect the negroes of West Africa to become all at once intelligent, self-governing people. For many years the white races must be their guardians and educators, and we must educate the negro by force if necessary, leaving him to understand us afterwards, when we have raised him to a condition to do so. This, then, is our mission in West Africa: to instruct the natives that idleness is the eighth deadly sin; next, to so instruct the native as to the existence of the resources of this country; and, lastly, to educate him in the principles of civilised society, and so assimilate his views with our own that he and we may be bound together with the ties of commerce and Empire.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sierra Leone is not a colony about which we can boast very much. It is about 102 years old, thus considerably younger than the Gambia, which almost ranks with Newfoundland as being one of the very first British possessions abroad. Sierra Leone, however, has not much to show for its century of British rule. Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary. Here at present the great Mahommedan Chief Samadu is the actual ruler, and has created one of those African empires which are easily reared by successful robbers with extravagant bloodshed and widespread depredation. Samadu has several times fought the French on the Senegambian frontier, but of late he is said to have concluded peace with them. The productions of Sierra Leone are those of true Western Africa, and the colony is rich and well-favoured in vegetable wealth. It exports palm oil, palm kernels, rubber, gum, camwood, besides skins and benniseed and ground nuts.\n\nLiberia is British in language, and to a great extent in such culture as it possesses, although it enjoys an independent Government. But its native inhabitants, the Kru-boys, are under the delusion that they are British subjects ""of a sort,"" and do not admit any political connexion with the Americanised negroes who claim to govern them. On the east of Liberia, between the frontier and the west boundary of the French Gold Coast, is the Ivory Coast, about 100 miles in extent, and one of the last portions of the African coast, which remains unclaimed, unprotected, and unannexed by any European Power. Such trade as is done with it is purely British, and is chiefly with the town of Bristol. Its inhabitants are allied to the Kru races of Liberia.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A like change for the better has attended the reorganisation of our West African colonies, which, more or less, dates from the Ashanti War. In former times sufficient attention was not always given by the authorities to the suitability of candidates for employment in the minor posts in these then much despised West African possessions. But all this has greatly changed. The growing importance of the West African trade, and the general éclaircissement which followed the operations of the Ashanti War, have brought about a different spirit in the administration of these colonies, and the present colonial service in West Africa is not inferior to any other branch of the service in other parts of the world, and of late has furnished a considerable proportion of remarkable men who have distinguished themselves on the West Coast of Africa, and have been raised to posts of great influence and distinction elsewhere. I think, however, that decidedly more might be done to encourage such work as I have referred to in Lagos, namely, a thorough and scientific examination of the natural history and ethnology of these lands, so that we can be better guided in our administration of them, both by increasing our knowledge of their natural resources and by becoming more acquainted with the character of the races whom we are to rule. Especially should the learning of native languages be fostered among colonial officers. This movement has been already begun on the Gold Coast by Sir Brandford Griffith, and in Lagos by Captain Moloney, but I do not think any official steps have been taken in the matter. In nearly all the great divisions of Africa there is some lingua Franca—some widespread language of general use among native traders, or the ruling caste, which would be understood everywhere, from Benin to Old Calabar, and up the Niger to its confluence with the Benue; the Yoruba tongue, which is prevalent throughout Logos colony and right away to the kingdom of Nupe; the Hausa language, which is a good deal spoken in the Gold Coast colony, and which is one of the leading tongues of the Niger basin; the Mandingo, which is widely spread as a commercial language over the Sierra Leone colony; and the Wolof, which is much spoken on the Gambia. In the learning of each one of these languages in their respective spheres of influence colonial officers should be encouraged by small bounties or some palpable reward. These languages are simple in construction, and are illustrated by grammars and dictionaries published by the various missionary societies.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Reported Troubles in the Cameroons', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A recent telegram from Liverpool says that news received by the West African steamship Boma from the German colony of the Cameroons, which arrived in the Mersey on Nov. 11, shows that some serious disturbances have occurred there. The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs. Although one of the reports said that the Natives would rise against the Germans and drive them out of the river, it was not believed by the English that anything of the kind would be attempted, as the Germans a few years ago gave the Natives a lesson of their strength which they are not likely to forget.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH TRADE WITH WESTERN AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '**BRITISH TRADE WITH WESTERN AFRICA.**\n\n**Mr. Alvan Millson**, Assistant Colonial Secretary for the Colony of Lagos, delivered an address recently before the members of the African Trade Section of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce on the subject of Yorubaland.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1891#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.725, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}]",True
