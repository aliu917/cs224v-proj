36,"British efforts to secure religious freedom in Fernando Po, including diplomatic engagement with Spain and maintaining strategic economic interests, underscore the broader struggle for religious rights in colonial territories.","The examination of British efforts to secure religious freedom in Fernando Po reveals a nuanced picture when combining insights from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa does not provide specific details directly supporting the claim of British diplomatic engagement with Spain or strategic economic interests related to religious freedom in Fernando Po. It mentions British intervention to protect missionaries and their converts, particularly when the Spanish governor declared Catholicism the official religion, creating challenges for the Baptists. However, it lacks elaboration on diplomatic efforts with Spain or economic strategies. In contrast, The African Times articles offer substantial support for the claim, highlighting diplomatic engagement through correspondence between the African Times editor and the Earl of Clarendon, urging the British Government to advocate for Protestant Christians' religious freedom in Fernando Po. The articles also discuss strategic economic interests, such as the proposal to relocate the bread and coal depot to Amboises Bay, under British sovereignty, reflecting the intertwining of religious rights with economic and strategic interests. While the articles focus on Fernando Po and do not explicitly connect these efforts to a broader struggle for religious rights in other colonial territories, they provide a detailed account of British involvement in religious and economic matters in this specific context.","The General History of Africa textbook does not provide specific details that directly support or refute the claim regarding British efforts to secure religious freedom in Fernando Po through diplomatic engagement with Spain and maintaining strategic economic interests. The text mentions British intervention to protect missionaries and their converts in Fernando Po, particularly when the Spanish governor declared Catholicism as the official religion, leading to the untenable position of the Baptists. However, it does not elaborate on any diplomatic engagement with Spain or strategic economic interests related to religious freedom in Fernando Po. The broader struggle for religious rights in colonial territories is touched upon through the mention of missionary activities and their influence, but the specific claim about British diplomatic efforts and economic strategies in Fernando Po is not addressed. This absence of information on diplomatic engagement with Spain and economic interests in the context of religious freedom is a notable difference between the claim and the content of the textbook.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim regarding British efforts to secure religious freedom in Fernando Po. The articles highlight diplomatic engagement with Spain, as seen in the correspondence between the African Times editor and the Earl of Clarendon, urging the British Government to advocate for religious freedom on behalf of Protestant Christians in Fernando Po. This aligns with the claim of British diplomatic efforts to secure religious rights. Additionally, the articles discuss the strategic economic interests, such as the suggestion to relocate the bread and coal depot from Fernando Po to Amboises Bay, which is under British sovereignty and offers better economic conditions. This reflects the broader struggle for religious rights intertwined with economic and strategic interests in colonial territories. However, the articles do not explicitly connect these efforts to a broader struggle for religious rights in other colonial territories, which is a difference from the claim.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858. But local opposition to the Baptists continued to be high, especially as many of the Anglo-West Indian settlers at Victoria also traded in competition with the Bimbia population."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'The state of African religious life on the eve of colonial rule > Christianity in pre-colonial Africa', 'content': ""The opportunity to live in the hinterland made missionaries more and more knowledgeable about Africa and this was to become a crucial factor during the last quarter of the nineteenth century when the Scramble for Africa began.

But there was an equally important assumption which seems to have been confused by some colonial administrators and other apologists of colonialism and this is the fact that the British, like other colonizers, went out to the colonies primarily, if not exclusively, to enrich themselves and promote their own interests. The development of the colonized was none of their business. Where there was 'development' in the colonies, it was by and large a by-product of activities intended to promote the interests of the colonizers. It would be meaningless to imagine the colonial state apparatus making important policy decisions without taking into account the interests of the unofficial representatives of imperialism. These unofficial agents operated especially through com› mercial firms, mining firms and banks. They represented group interests in the colonial legislatures and different committees, or acted as pressure groups. In the absence of well-organized African representation, as was the case in most colonies, white settlers and representatives of expatriate companies were able to obtain many concessions from the colonial govern› ments at the expense of the local populations. Colonial policy and practice, in other words, were shaped by both political and economic determinants. As a matter of fact, in many cases, the unofficial elements affected the local population more directly than the administration did. They bought and collected agricultural products from the former and sold imported goods to them. They also employed indigenous labour. In both cases, there was very little government interference. Evidently the prices of exports and imports and the level of wages affected the people's day-to-day life more than the district commissioner's annual tax-collecting visit to the rural areas. Such a state of affairs was in no way a peculiarity of a few colonies. It was the normal reality of colonial economic relations. And since such relations are predominantly economic, colonial practice was conditioned by economic laws. 1"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.61, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Madagascar 1800-80', 'section_title': 'Rana valona I (1828-61): a period of reaction or stabilization?', 'content': ""The religion spread underground, with clandestine meetings of Christian communities in caves (e.g. in the region of Fihaonana in the Vonizongo, north-west of Imerina) and in private homes, even in Antananarivo.

The Jesuits, for their part, organized a mission to the Petites îles (Nosy Be, Nosy Faly and Mayotte in the north- west and Sainte-Marie in the east) from where they tried to infiltrate to the mainland, especially the Bay of Faly, which they were forced to leave in 1857. This has been referred to by some writers as 'the darkest period of Ranavalona's reign',$^{28}$ and Ranavalona has earned such names as the 'Queen Mary of Madagascar', 'a modern Messalina or female Nero'. Even so, the Malagasy court was anxious not to break completely with Britain, so as to avoid confrontation with a hostile alliance of Britain and France.\nThe Malagasy leaders realized that the country needed contact with the outside world, to secure European manufactured goods, particularly guns and ammunition. They also wanted to buy luxury goods such as cloth and alcohol and to expand their exports, mainly cattle and rice, to Mauritius and RØunion in order to pay for the necessary imports. Queen Ranavalona therefore wanted to find a modus vivendi with the Europeans, to enable her country to develop without the fear of European antagonism and war. In pursuit of this policy, she and her advisers decided in 1836 to send an embassy to France and England and to negotiate fresh treaties of friendship and commerce, based on respect for Malagasy culture and independence and to secure recognition for Ranavalona I as Queen of Madagascar.$^{29}$ The Malagasy embassy - the first ever to be sent to Europe - consisted of six officers and two secretaries and was led by Andriantsitchaina.$^{30}$ Their stay in Paris was uneventful and they then crossed the Channel to London.

Yet it has proved extremely difficult in practice to discuss resistance within this chronological limitation. At one extreme I have discussed Makana, the Xhosa prophet of the early nineteenth century. At the other extreme I have discussed the Zambezi rising of 1917 and its links with FRELIMO. But at least I have so far limited discussion to armed resistance to white invasion or to armed uprisings against colonial rule as it began to 'bite'; the chronological extensions arise from the uneven nature of white advance into Africa and from the still more uneven establish› ment of effective colonial control. Using this essentially political definition the period between 1880 and 1900 emerges as a crucial period of resistance, even if many of the great attempts to redefine sovereignty through protest took place later.\nIf we now turn in conclusion to the developing emphasis on economic resistance, the chronological limits become even less clearly defined. Perhaps the most radical reinterpretation is that of Samir Amin. Amin argues that the really crucial West African resistances to Europe came in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and he dismisses the resist› ances of the Scramble period itself as the half-hearted, rearguard actions of an already compromised ruling class. In Amin's eyes what was essentially at stake in the confrontation between Africa and Europe was not formal political control but Europe's attempts at economic manipulation. The truly significant African resistance was directed against such economic manipu› lation.\nAmin argues that the trade across the Sahara had 'strengthened state centralization and stimulated progress'. The European-controlled Atlantic trade, on the other hand, 'did not give rise to any productive forces: on the contrary, this caused a disintegration of society ... African societies obviously opposed this worsening of their situation, and Islam served as the basis for their resistance ... The Muslim priests tried to organize a resistance movement; their aim was to stop the slave trade, i.e. the export of the labour force, but not to end internal slavery ...

'The White Fathers were not able to return to their mission for almost fifty years'.$^{58}$ In 1885 the White Fathers took over two stations near Ujiji, which had been established by the African International Association after King Leopold of Belgium had decided to concentrate his efforts in the Congo Free State.\nUntil 1884, therefore, European pressures in the East African hinterland were mainly exerted by missionary societies. Even where there existed commercial activities, they were offshoots of missionary work. Two such examples existed. The first was the Livingstonia Central African Trading Company, which was associated with Scottish missionary activities in the Lake Nyasa region. Its aim was said to be that of supplying the mission station at Blantyre with necessities through running steamships in the waterways of the region and also that of bringing ivory for commerce at a price that would undercut the Arab merchants using slave labour for porterage. The second example is also associated with the Scottish Free Church. A member of the Church, William Mackinnon, who owned the British India Steam Navigation Company, started running ships to Zan› zibar in 1872.

And for governments in difficulties requiring London's support, an abolitionist gesture was as good as genuine co-operation. On the other hand, the English plan was bound to attract opposition from interests likely to be damaged by forcible suppression. States opposed it in the name of their national sovereignty, for the right of search and joint commissions presupposed a partial surrender of that sovereignty. They saw abolition as an aspect of the wicked machinations of the British in their bid for world hegemony, backed by the absolute superiority of the Royal Navy. They opposed it on the grounds of the damage that would be done to navies, colonies and national trading interests. Portugal, Spain, the USA and France used and distributed cotton, sugar, coffee and tobacco produced on slave plantations dependent on the import of Africans into Brazil, Cuba, the Southern States of the USA and the West Indies.

But Portugal reserved to herself the right to trade legally south of the Equator, and this only came to an end in 1842 under the threat of severe military sanctions from Britain. Spain strengthened her anti-slavery legislation and her agreements with London, but Cuba continued the trade until 1866, the year of the third abolition law in Spain. The Cortes, the Council of State and the Treasury all gave way before the threat of secession by the island's planters.$^{5}$ A conditional promise by the British of de jure recognition for Brazil induced the new empire to conclude the 1826 suppression treaty; but even so the Brazilian trade increased until 1850. It stopped in the following year; but this was not simply because the Royal Navy violated Brazil's territorial waters to clear them of slave ships.

That purportedly 'barbarous' kingdom, where the 'forces of darkness' predominated, was, in fact, ruled by a queen and a prime minister who had been converts to Christianity since 2i February 1869. It is true that they had been baptized as Protestants and that the majority of the leaders and the population had followed their example, but they had not prevented people from embracing Catholicism nor had they thwarted the activities of the French missionaries. This liberal attitude goes to show the separation that existed between the churches and the state, even though 'around the chapel in the queen's palace, the Prime Minister may have tried to form a national Church, the Palace Church, composed of Malagasy churchmen and evangelists in his service'. 5 These attempts gave rise to lingering fears among the Jesuits and to an 'incorrigible mistrust' among the representatives of the London Missionary Society (LMS).\nIn 1877, the royal government freed the Masombika slaves imported from the African mainland and arranged for them to be settled on lands allocated to them. In 1878, it recast the legal system, which was henceforward entrusted to three courts whose task it was to conduct investigations, while decision-making lay with the prime minister. The 'Code of 305 Articles, a legislative innovation embracing civil law, criminal law and legal procedure'$^{6}$ was promulgated in 1881.

Amin is here describing resistances which were directed against an African aristocracy, but which were also a response to French economic aggression.\nAs the nineteenth century developed, Amin goes on to argue, the French ceased to demand slaves and came to demand raw materials and agricultural produce instead. In Waalo they began to experiment with agricultural plantations but these failed because of 'the resistance of the village com› munities'. The French could not succeed in overcoming resistance to proletarianization until they had occupied the whole area and were able to use continuous force. But this colonial conquest came so late in the progression that resistance to it was not very effective. By this time Islam had ceased to be an ideology of resistance and had become the spiritual solace of the defeated aristocracy, who used it to discipline peasant culti› vators and to ensure that they produced whatever the French demanded from them. 39 If Amin argues that the really important resistances came before the Scramble, other historians employing the economic perspective seem to be arguing that the really important resistances to formal colonial rule came only in the twentieth century. Certainly there was plenty of economic resist› ance during the Scramble. In particular, the Europeans broke away from their old alliance with African traders and middlemen and used force to set up a monopoly of commerce. The result was fierce resistance on the part of African traders - whether it was led by chief Nana Olomu of Itsekiri in the Niger delta (Nigeria), whom A. G. Hopkins describes as the very type of the homo economicus, or by the African and Swahili chiefs who had dominated the slave trade in northern Mozambique, or by the great trader, Rumaliza, who fought against both the Belgians and the Germans in East Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.615, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Central Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'The struggle to maintain independence: the era of confrontation and alliance', 'content': 'rivals actually assisted the imperialist powers in the hope of enhancing their internal position.

On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in North Africa and the Sahara', 'section_title': 'The Maghrib states and the Europeans', 'content': 'The nineteenth-century colonialist drive in North Africa was unusual in being a sequel to earlier campaigns (see Fig. 5.2).\nThe Moroccan government had for four centuries been resisting the Spaniards who had established themselves at Ceuta and Melilla. It always forbade the inhabitants to have anything to do with them; and it was to break this blockade that Spain launched the 1859-60 war that was so disastrous for Morocco. She was forced to pay a heavy fine, to agree to the enlargement of the fortified part of Melilla and to cede a port on the Atlantic coast as a refuge for fishermen from the Canary Islands. 6 With the acquisition of the bay of Rio de Oro - whose occupation was notified on 26 December 1884, to the signatories to the Berlin Act on the division of Africa into zones of influence - Spain by the end of the century had three bridgeheads on the North African coast.\nIn 1880 and 1881, when the Madrid Conference on the protection of individuals in Morocco met in two sessions, the Makhzen made a last attempt to get its independence and sovereignty over a clearly defined territory accepted at the international level. Despite English support, the attempt failed in the face of the selfish alliance of France, Spain and Italy. France, which had briefly thought all was lost in Morocco, raised the Tuât problem immediately after the end of this conference. Indeed, there was much talk in Paris at the time about the plan for a trans-Saharan railway line, which would open up Central Africa to French trade. But the plan ran up against a serious obstacle: the oases of the central Sahara were politically dependent on Morocco.

This chapter seeks to examine the nature and major characteristic of these economies.\nThe British, like other colonizers, did not develop a universal theory of colonialism which could embrace all aspects of life in all colonies. Nor did they develop anything near a universal practice of colonialism. Indeed this was impossible as colonialism was imposed on peoples with extremely diverse cultures and backgrounds, and living in widely differing environ› ments. Much was left to the administrators to deal with situations depend› ing on the local conditions. Even in the absence of a clear theory, however, a critical examination of colonial relations brings to light some fundamental assumptions which seem to have acted as guidelines for both the framers and implementers of colonial economic policies. First, the colonies were expected to provide raw materials (agricultural products and minerals) to feed the machines of the industrial imperial power. Second, the colonies had to import manufactured goods from the imperial power. These two assumptions divided the empire into two distinct economic camps - the colonies and the metropolis. Significantly there was very little reciprocity in the relationship. While in most cases the colonies had an obligation to export to Britain before they could consider any other buyer, even if such a buyer would pay higher prices, Britain had no obligation to import exclusively from any of her colonies. She operated through rational econo› mic choices and bought from whoever sold at low prices. The colonized people were also at a disadvantage in the import trade. In some cases they had to buy expensive British manufactures as the colonial state apparatus, under pressure from Britain, raised customs duties for non-British goods. Third, the colonies had to be self-supporting. The colonized peoples had to raise revenue for the general administration and for whatever limited development projects that were undertaken.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.617, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in East Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'Religious protest movements', 'content': ""One of the weapons that East Africans used from early on in their struggle against colonialism was religion. Resistance called for mobilization, and in many regions religious leadership arose to fulfil this role. The era of primary resistance was also the era of the prophets. While the Africans lost the actual wars in the battlefield, the mood of resistance remained entrenched in the hearts of the many. The followers of the Orkoiyot in Nandi remained active and watchful and the Nandi were repeatedly mobilized by this prophetic leadership to resist the abuses of colonialism over the years.$^{4}$ Similarly colonial archives from Kenya are full of references to witch doctors and laibons creating trouble in Marakwet, Kericho and Samburu. In western Uganda the followers of the Nyabingi cult in Kigezi were being watched all through these years. Thus these traditional religious resistance movements provided an element of continuity with the former era. But as the first decade wore on into the second, colonialism appeared to be gaining in strength; to many, indeed, it appeared as if the worst of the evils had come to earth. The colonial forces dug in, restructured or destroyed the known social and political institutions, and imposed their own structures over the various communities. It appeared that colonized Africans needed a new spiritual reinvigoration in order to stand up against colonialism in its many forms. This spiritual need was filled in two ways: first by the emergence of a new generation of African prophets, and secondly by the founding of African independent churches alongside the European Christian churches, with a view to providing 'a place to feel at home' for the many Africans who had accepted Christianity but found it intolerable to live under missionary patronage. 5\nAlthough not sufficiently covered in the existing historical writing, substantial initiative was displayed by those African prophets who arose and offered relief from the stresses which colonialism had introduced into the social fabric. These religious innovations were protest movements. Starting from the second decade, these activities were to continue through› out the 1920s and 1930s, and were to be joined by many more after the Second World War.

They have sought refuge at Amboises Bay, directly N.E. of Fernando Po, and a much finer harbour. The sovereignty of Amboises Bay and the surrounding territory was ceded, many years ago, to Colonel Nichols for the British Crown. Surely the Government expenditure on the coast of Africa ought to be made preferentially in our own possessions. At Amboises Bay there is a constantly flowing stream of the finest fresh water; and yams, &c., are not above one-third the price they fetch at Fernando Po.

Our esteemed friend, Mr. Chamerovzow (for whom we made an appeal last month, which we now renew, and desire to press on the particular attention of Africans), being in Madrid, and believing, as we did, that the prohibition of worship by his Excellency the Governor of Fernando Po was not in conformity with the spirit and intentions of the present Spanish Government, we entreated him to render a new service to Africans by applying to that Government for a decree or order to the Governor of Fernando Po, to allow entire freedom of religious worship. Our friend entered, as we knew he would, with ardour into our views, and urged upon the Minister for the Colonies the consideration of the hardship under which the Protestant Christians of Fernando Po now laboured in being prohibited the exercise of public worship, soliciting also the decree or order above mentioned. The Minister for the Colonies expressed his deep regret that by an oversight Fernando Po was not included in the decree which gave this freedom of worship to Cuba, Porto Rico, &c., and stated that a decree was in preparation, which would be promulgated after the necessary formalities, for regulating that and other matters in Fernando Po. Our friend Mr. Chamerovzow stated, in continuation, that those necessary formalities might, however, occupy several months; and recommended some petitions from England to the Spanish Government on the subject. On consideration, however, it appeared to us that the more efficient course would be to move the British Government in the affair, and obtain an application from this Government, through the Ambassador at Madrid to the Spanish Government, in favour of a speedy bestowal of this boon of freedom of public worship of the Africans and others at Fernando Po. We are now pursuing this course, and hope it will lead to a speedy realisation of the desires of the Protestant Christians in the island. We always considered the British Government to have been greatly in fault in not having obtained for them the promise of this freedom of worship when they gave up the island to the Spanish Government; and are further of opinion that the fact of many of the Protestant Christians in Fernando Po having been made such under the labours of British ministers of the Gospel when the island was under our rule will give additional force to any application that may be made by the Earl of Clarendon, through Mr. Layard, to the Spanish Government on the subject. We have not lost sight of the fact of two missionaries having lately left England for the island, sent out by the Society of Primitive Methodists; and we most earnestly hope that our efforts may be attended with such speedy success, that they may be free to labour among those who are thirsting for the blessing we are endeavouring to procure for them.""}, {'id': 1767, 'article_title': 'Endeavour to Obtain Freedom of Worship in Fernando Po', 'full_section_title': 'Endeavour to Obtain Freedom of Worship in Fernando Po', 'last_edit_date': '02-19-1870', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1870#article-14', 'issue_date': '23_03_1870', 'content': ""In an editorial last month we stated what we had caused to be done in Madrid for obtaining freedom of worship at Fernando Po; and also that we had followed this up by an application to the right honourable the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, praying him to use his good offices with the Spanish Government accomplishing that desirable object.

By some strange oversight when the island was restored to Spain there was no promise asked that this freedom of worship should be continued to the people. The result was that the Protestant missionaries were compelled by the Spanish authorities to discontinue their services. Some of their flock went with them to Victoria (Ambas Bay). The residue, and the Sierra-Leone and other British Protestants who reside in the island for purposes of trade, have from that time been deprived of the public exercise of their religion.\n\nSince the late changes in Spain one of the missionaries from Victoria visited Fernando Po, believing that the freedom of religious worship proclaimed in Spain extended to all her colonies. The Governor, however, forbade the meeting of the Protestants for public worship anywhere in the island. Under similar misconception as to freedom of public worship being now permitted, two missionaries have lately left England for Fernando Po, where, I am sorry to say, they will not be allowed to hold any services.\n\nUnder these circumstances, and as such prohibition on the part of the Governor of Fernando Po is entirely opposed to the declared opinions of the existing Spanish Government, and to the laws actually in operation in Spain, Havana, Porto Rico, &c., I have the honour to entreat your lordship, on behalf of the Protestant Christian British subjects and others at Fernando Po, that you will interfere in their behalf, and obtain from the Spanish Government an order to the Governor of Fernando Po to establish and permit an entire freedom of public and private religious worship in the island.—I have the honour to remain, my lord, your lordship's most obedient servant,\n\nF.

We say justification, because ""Fair-play"" does not in his letter excuse the Governor, but accuses all those who have complained of the treatment received from him.

Permit me to say that this is only characteristic of the Spanish Government; their promises are made with the intention of being broken. For this past two years Consul Hopkins had used his every endeavour to obtain the permission of the Spanish authorities here to allow a school to be opened for the benefit of the children of British parents, without success. One day his petition would be acceded to, the next it was rejected, although with the proviso that all the clauses mentioned in the Constitution would be strictly adhered to. During the absence of a Protestant missionary here there was no school, but immediately after the arrival of the Rev. Mr. Luddington, the Spanish school was again re-opened. Is this not very suggestive of the ""dog in the manger""?\n\nAnother case is that of an Englishman, by name of Mr. Young, who was brought here from Elobey in January last year, and tried for the killing of a native in defence of his own life, and who was sentenced to four months\' imprisonment, having been found guilty of imprudence, and who is still a prisoner here.\n\nIt appears that Governor Salgado (he who expelled six British subjects in the space of six months, amongst whom was the Rev. Mr. Holland) was under the impression that Mr. Young had bribed the Judge; but it is generally accepted that no such impression existed, as there was not a single particle of evidence to substantiate the charge; but the antagonistical hatred he held to all British subjects was the only cause for the case being sent to the Ordinance Chamber of Cuba. Great astonishment and indignation is felt here amongst British subjects at the want of Ministerial interference on the part of the British Government. Much neglect is positively exhibited. Even allowing the absolute necessity of the case going to Cuba, must it needs take all this time for the opinion of the supreme tribunal to be returned; and keep a British subject unlawfully imprisoned for over sixteen months after the sentence passed upon him has expired, and in this climate, without saying one word for what cause?

Here we have commerce at its lowest ebb, agriculture without protection, religion and all material interests harassed and worried by vexatious edicts; men\'s liberties outraged, acts of violence and oppression following one after another, and people feeling themselves and their property altogether at the mercy of absolute, irresponsible, and evil-disposed men, of whom no account will probably be required by their masters, even if they should by chance ever know of what has been done. Without any reason that is known the Governor lately published the following edict: ""Be it known to the public from date that no meeting is to take place after sunset until its rising next morning, and the Government thinks fit to prohibit the meetings of the English Methodists between the hours of seven and eight o\'clock on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday evenings.—By command of the Governor of this Colony, Sept. 19, 1878, Alejandro Arias Salgado."" The Governor had evidently received no good from his attendance at the four meetings immediately preceding the publication of his latest order. Carefully note the wording of this new law. Can anything be more peremptory or absolute, or more clearly show how desirous this man is to curtail the liberties and privileges of at least the Protestant portion of the public, which you know to be the bulk of the population of Santa Isabella? It is by command of the Governor. He does not even make the order in the name of his King; the King himself could not have been more peremptory. The man who has done this has also sent his men to forcibly take the keys of a man\'s safe and opening it, pay thereout a fine which he had inflicted. The same man also sent his people to go into a store and seize all the medicines in it (some of them having been ordered by a Government doctor and refused acceptance of), fining the owner of the store above 40l. for dealing in medicines, although they have been sold by all the stores ever since Europeans came to the island, and are a great boon to the public; but, ""I,"" the Governor, will not have it, and by virtue of the extraordinary discretionary powers with which ""I"" am entrusted, ""I"" seize and fine, and imprison, and transport. A mighty man is he (as the songs says of the blacksmith) in Fernando Po. But who is this mighty man, more powerful in his little sphere than King, or Emperor, or Czar? Outside this little island a very insignificant member of the ""great unknown"" These Governors come and go like comets, making a great stew and fuss whilst they last, and then disappear, never more to be heard of. Their reign is short and that is the only comfort we have when we get a bad one. But they are not all bad. We have had many good Governors, both military and naval, whose names are remembered with love and deep regard; but there were others whose base and evil dispositions have earned for them the maledictions of this most docile and tractable race of men. The system, however, of a two years\' governorship is a bad one. If we get a good earnest, sensible, far-seeing man, he is followed probably by one who is lazy, incapable, self-seeking and vain, with the result that he undoes all the good his predecessor has done. They are not long enough in office to take any real interest in their work. Little care have they for Fernando Po, so long as they draw their double pay, and turn their back on it when their term is ended; it is to the home Government that we must look for a remedy for these evils, which will some time become unendurable and end in violence. The Government has only to look at Cuba to see what official intolerance and disregard for the liberties of the people have done. A civil Governor, and one who knows something of the art of governing, as well as of the means best calculated to encourage agriculture and commerce, one with broad and liberal views of men and things in general, and who is willing to receive sound advice from those he has to govern—is the man wanted here; and he should be appointed for a term of five years. Compare the prosperous condition of the British Colonies along this Coast with the present condition of things here, and then let the Government ask what is the cause of it. The reason is not far to seek, in spite of the disadvantages of heavy duties levied in the British Colonies; and we shall have no improvement until the property and rights of the people here are made more secure from outrage, and a greater regard is shown for their convictions and privileges. As to the present Governor, it is suggested that those who have suffered through his injustice should band together and appeal for redress—legal redress—through the courts-of-law in Spain. A few hundred pounds would be well spent in bringing prominently before the Spanish public the doings of their irresponsible servants here, and would undoubtedly obtain the attention of the Spanish Government thereto.', 'last_edit_date': '1879-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1879#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Complaint from Fernando Po', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—I have now taken up my pen to inform you of the inhuman and unjust way in which British subjects are treated here by the Spanish authorities.\n\nIf I should say to an Englishman that he could be locked up in prison for no fault whatever, and without trial, for an unlimited space of time, it would appear to be an incredible falsehood; but, Sir, I must assure you it is the truth here, and the British Consul never interferes in any way whatever; in fact, he is never to be found in this island excepting by chance.

Where can such a thing happen with regard to any other colony? The dwellers under British authority no doubt have much to complain of, but they have also very much to be thankful for. Look at us here. Our usual Governor in his own country would doubtless be considered a very ordinary person in his private capacity, but here he has little short of the power of an absolute monarch, and the arrogance of an upstart. Who is there to call him to account? The people are dumb, and through fear of his power to injure them, and being an English-speaking people without sufficient knowledge of their government, are helpless to make their complaints heard. He is his own interpreter of the law, and puts whom he chooses in prison, and sets free at his own sweet will. He is, in fact, the law; and the whole settlement is under his sole and entire control. The government is, in a few words, a naval despotism. Let some of the acts of the present Governor speak for themselves. He personally walked into the Protestant Sunday-school one Sunday afternoon, and demanded of the teachers their authority for holding it, and verbally ordered it to be closed from that day, affirming the said act by a written document afterwards. He has issued orders to stop all public manifestations of worship other than the Roman Catholic. The notice-board had to be removed from the chapel, and the bell to hold its tongue. Not content with this, he closed the Day-school, and compelled all the children to attend the Government School. The missionary's wife has been doing her share of good in teaching a few girls to sew, &c., and thus the endeavour to make better women and better wives of them. This, too, he has stopped; there are to be no more sewing classes. Thus a blow is struck at the liberty of a man's home, and his invitations to that home are liable to be prohibited or permitted at the will of this very parental government, which would go so far as even to pry and interfere in a man's domestic affairs. There is a mission at George's Bay, a place only heard of and visited once every few years by the gunboat, which he probably would not have taken the trouble to have gone near in the interest of trade, or to stop war amongst the natives, or to gain a better knowledge of the people and country he is governing; but, as a doughty son of the Church, he doubtless felt himself urged, without delay, to stop the injury being done by the British heretics at this place, who were busy teaching the natives there to read the Bible, and to become civilized and useful subjects of King Alfonso. So the gunboat was sent, and the school ordered to be closed. He even forbade preaching, but this he afterwards permitted. The arbitrary acts of this man in thus injuring the British Mission here, which has been allowed to do its work by permission of the Government, and has spent a deal of money in houses, &c., on the good faith of the permission granted, will doubtless be the subject of diplomatic correspondence between London and Madrid, so soon as the Consul expected here is in possession of the necessary particulars; but this means a great loss of time, and meanwhile the missionaries, who are here for good, and hitherto doing real good to all, are wasting time and health to no purpose. If the Government approve of the acts of their subordinate, the mission is as good as closed, in which case, no doubt, the money spent on premises will be refunded them. The missionaries are by no means the only people who suffer from the misrule of the present Governor. Nothing is being done towards improving the town. There are still no roads, and no greater knowledge of the inhabitants of this island than that possessed by the first Governor. There is an absence of all governing enterprise beyond the town. The interior resources of the island are as much a mystery to the world as ever. He finds it easier to harass and annoy the people, who, being in the town, he has power over to injure.

If, however—as the honourable gentleman asserts—Spain has fairly and honestly fulfilled her Slave-trade Treaty obligations, it is impossible to conceive what justification the British Government has, of any kind, for interfering, by representation or otherwise, in this matter. There is in this statement an incomprehensible inconsistency, the most striking and forcible comment upon which is to be found in the speaker\'s own account of the manner in which Spain has so fairly and honestly kept her pledged promises. He states that from 1835 to 1868 the number of slaves annually landed in Cuba was 40,000—a total of 1,320,000. A similar statement was made by Earl Russell a few years ago. The official returns do not give so large a number, but they are admittedly inaccurate, and the local authorities deny the introduction of anything approaching to that figure—a denial obviously in the interests of those authorities to make, but none the less unfounded in relation to the fact. It is not here the place to enter into the vexed question of the amount of the slave-population of Cuba, but in a memorial to Marshal Espartero, presented to him by the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society in 1854, some very curious illustrations of Spanish census records will be found quoted, which demonstrate the utter unfaithfulness of documentary evidence issued by the Spanish Government in all matters relating to the slavery question in Cuba. It is no part of our business to attempt to reconcile the flagrant discrepancies those records bear upon their own face. It is sufficient for our present purpose to state that the late Earl of Aberdeen denounced them as false, and affirmed that the slave-population of the island was notoriously far in excess of the number announced by the Government of Spain. The very last returns made by the local authorities were one-half below those of the ecclesiastical authorities, who, for purposes of their own, keep, and have the means of procuring, more authentic records. In 1868, when the abolition of slavery was being pressed upon the Provisional Government at Madrid, the number of slaves in Cuba was affirmed not to exceed 400,000; which, if true, and if true also the reputed importations from 1835 up to 1868—according to Earl Russell and Viscount Enfield\'s affirmations of the fact—would exhibit an average mortality of 30 per cent. per annum. We believe the actual slave-population of Cuba to be nearer 800,000 than 400,000, leaving out the emancipados, and all of these have a right to their immediate and unconditional liberty. The position the British Government might be urged to assume is to assert our treaty-rights, and upon the strength of them to demand the freedom of the Cuban slaves. Had Mr. Hughes\'s motion been framed with this one object, the country would have been made to comprehend exactly the circumstances of the case, and its judgment asked, not in favour of Spain, but of those unfortunate hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children, held in bondage in Cuba—an iniquity for which the British Government, for the last thirty-five years through, is in a great measure responsible. We are prepared to admit that a motion so framed and pressed to a division would have left the mover in a minority, but the weight of facts, the force of argument, and, greater than either, the right and the justice would have been on his side. We know that when a power violates its treaty engagements, the other party to the contract has a right to constitute such a violation a casus belli, and it is remarkable that the late Lord Palmerston, the Earl of Clarendon, and other occupants of the Foreign Office in Downing-street, averted pressure, when it was demanded against Spain, by submitting to the applicants the uncomfortable query: ""Would you have us go to war with Spain?""—a question involving the acknowledgment of the delinquency of that Power, and the helplessness—ought we not rather to say, the unwillingness—of the Governments of the day to deal with that Power as a delinquent. Whilst we do not advocate war, we may allow ourselves to record the fact, that it has been waged for objects infinitely less righteous, and we ought not to omit to refer to the Don Pacifico claims, when the doubtful rights of a private individual nearly involved us in a war with Greece, because Lord Palmerston thought proper to indulge in a special bit of vapouring against a weak State. We assert that diplomacy possesses resources—short of war—which can be rendered effective against a delinquent Power. In the case of Spain, mere representations were laughed at, for, in spite of her shameful conduct, she never asked a favour, but it was granted. She was placed, in every respect, on the footing of the most honourable and most favoured nation. Her slave-grown products—which ought to have been excluded from our markets—were admitted to compete with those of our emancipated colonies, contrary to the protestations and representations of the anti-slavery party, and in defiance of all reason and justice. Whilst the slave-trade was rife, the clause in the Washington Treaty of 1842, empowering Great Britain, the United States, and France to proceed actively against Spain, because her wilful contempt of her slave-trade treaties compelled these Powers to maintain a costly cruising system, with its expensive paraphernalia of Mixed Commission Courts, was never brought into operation—was, in fact, a deader letter than any of that class of defunct literature. Were it now asked that it be applied, the answer would probably be, ""Since 1868, we have no authentic record of any slaves having been landed in Cuba; and Spain has fairly and honestly fulfilled her treaty obligations, therefore we have no case against her."" Why, even according to Viscount Enfield\'s admissions, it is only since 1868 that the slave-trade into Cuba has ceased, and this is not by any means so certain. It was in the early part of December in that year, that the Cuban insurrection broke out. If cargoes of Bozali have been landed in the parts occupied by the insurrectionists, the fact would not reach any ""authentic source of information."" The other parts are in the power of the Spanish party, almost to a man in favour of the old order of things; and if cargoes of fresh slaves have been discharged, on the sea-board their forces, combined with those of the mother-country, command the chances are a thousand to one in favour of the fact not being revealed. We hold it, from a private source, that the slave-trade continues, not to so great an extent even as in 1866, but sufficiently to establish a continuous violation of treaties.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-06-24', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_06_1872#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Important Slave-trade Papers Just Published', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs to Sir J.

The 'Holy War' at sea, which Algeria, Tunisia, Tripolitania and Morocco had been waging for a long time, was a source of grave anxiety to European traders and shipowners. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Europe still went in fear of the corsairs of the Maghrib. If Neapolitan sailing ships were making for the coast and caught sight of a Tunisian or Tripolitanian flag, their crews were quick to make their escape. The merchants of Marseilles, Leghorn and other major European trading ports used to take full advantage of such displays of panic to get the better of their competitors, and especially 'Tunis-ach-chattra' (Tunisia-the-crafty) which entered the broad Mediterranean arena during the Napoleonic Wars. In 1800, Tunisian ships arrived in Malta and in 1809 in Leghorn. The dey's government in Algeria did very profitable business selling wheat. The trade and shipping conditions laid down by the Maghribian states aroused intense annoyance in Europe. Algeria, Tunisia and Tripolitania levied tribute and obliged friendly countries to pay for the free passage of their ships on the basis of peace and maritime navigation treaties.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome.

The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era.

European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement.

The colonizers had to supplant the Arab, Swahili and Indian merchants. Experiences in East Africa underscored the premise that colonial activities first centred around parts of Africa which had a prior involvement in inter› continental exchange. The coastal area of greatest interest to Britain and Germany was that claimed by the Sultan of Zanzibar (now Tanzania), who was the foremost comprador for the supply of ivory, slaves and slave-grown cloves to Europeans, Arabs, Indians and Americans. Setting out from the Swahili coastal towns, European colonizers followed the Arab lead and sought the termini of the caravan routes in the interlacustrine region. By the mid 1880s, the Scramble was already taking place on Lake Victoria, on whose shores colonial enterprises were quickly grafted on to the already high level of African economic activity. When the British completed their railway from Mombasa to the Lake in 1902 (see Fig. 16.3), it attracted freight which had been part of the caravan traffic which previously had existed further south at Tanga and Bagamoyo. As a result of British competition, the Germans too began a coast-hinterland railway in 1905, and this faithfully traversed the slave and ivory route to Lake Tanganyika. Deep within Central Africa, it was also the Arab trading network which provided the European colonizers with their first economic base.\nNorth Africa combined some of the features of East and West Africa, and displayed these in a heightened form.

When King Leopold called an international conference in Brussels in 1876 'to discuss methods of peaceful and co- operative action to develop legitimate commerce and attack the slave trade',$^{62}$ the rivalry was already appearing on the surface. The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo. The most significant action of the period was the British occupation of Egypt in 1882. For the British the action was justified because of the strategic position of Egypt (with the Suez Canal and the Nile) for British interests in India and East Africa, although East Africa was considered of less importance. But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year. In West Africa Germany and France were beginning to stand together to challenge the British position on the Niger. The 'high tide of imperialism' had begun to flow. When Bismark convened the Berlin Conference in November 1884, the process of partitioning Africa had already started. In East Africa Carl Peters had already arrived in Zanzibar under the auspices of his Gesellschaft für Deutsche Kolonisation (German Colonization Society) and had gone inland to negotiate treaties.

As a result, by the 1870s most of present-day Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, eastern Zaire, northern Zambia, Malawi and northern Mozambique had become part of a vast hinterland connected with Zanzibar through these coastal towns and therefore integrated to varying degrees into the international trading network.\nIt is tempting to consider this growth of long-distance trade as an unfortunate episode in which the Africans were helpless victims. Certainly in its degrading effects on human life, the slave trade had much disastrous personal and moral impact on East African societies. But the long-distance trade, in all its aspects, had a much greater impact in influencing the actual development of the societies involved. The Africans were by no means spectators of this process. As we shall demonstrate in the following examples, in many cases it was the Africans who seized the initiative in establishing trade relations with the coast. Yet, it is difficult to assess adequately the overall economic impact of this trade invasion on African societies. It is easier to recognize certain discernible contributions brought into the interior by this coastal penetration, such as new crops like maize and rice, and cultural impact represented by the spread of Islam and more significantly by the spread of the Swahili language. But economically how was the East African affected?\nPhilip Curtin, assessing the impact of a similar kind of trade involvement in the Senegambia region, concluded: The data are easily accurate enough to support the generalization that, in spite of the probability of strong contrary swings in wartime, the net barter terms of trade shifted consistently in favor of Senegambia over a period of nearly two centuries. Even if the accuracy of the estimates is no closer to reality than half or double, the overall shift to Senegambia's advantage from the 1680's to the 1830's would have been within the range of fivefold to twentyfold.

Yet in 1879 this whole structure began to crumble, and by 1900 it had ceased to exist.' With the imposition of colonial rule, 'the characteristic link between Africans and Europeans was no longer that between trading partners ... The most immediate effect of colonial rule was its impact on African traders by the end of World War I the radical decline of the relative importance of the African, as well as of the Arab, trading class had become an accomplished fact.' 40 But in general recent historians have been unsympathetic to trader resist› ance.

When the British Imperial East Africa Company wanted to break the power of Arab, Swahili and African traders it was able to build a new trade route inland from Malindi 'supported by stockades built by communities of slaves who had run away from their Arab masters on the coastal plantations'.$^{42}$ The 'important entrepreneurs' of the Lagos hinterland found it hard to offer effective resistance to the advance of the British because of the unrest of their 'large labour force consisting mainly of slaves and serfs'.$^{43}$ The conditions of international trade, which had brought about the rise of powerful African traders, had also ensured that their success would have to be brought at the price of much internal tension and resentment."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': ""On the eve of the 'Scramble'"", 'content': ""lend itself to a unified struggle against the Europeans.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The new changes resulted from a combination of factors, including the nineteenth-century wars which, as in Yorubaland, had the effect of ren› dering the coastal areas relatively safe and attractive to migration from the hinterlands in which most of the fighting took place; the sea-borne trade which was rendered permanent by the transition from slave to 'legitimate' trade, thereby conferring a definite economic advantage on the coastal regions; and the steady growth of European interest, which enlarged the traditional role of selected coastal towns such as Lagos, Porto Novo and eventually Cotonou to take on new and increasing responsibilities not only as ports but also as political capitals of emergent colonial states and their independent African successors.\nIn all these changes, however, the economic factor would appear to have been the most dominant, especially with reference to the European presence. Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others.

As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories.

Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'.

Another significant, if smaller, group was made up of students, who began to arrive in Europe in significant numbers by the middle of the eighteenth century and, in increasing numbers, throughout the nineteenth century. In an era in which commercial contact between Europe and Africa was increasing, it was an obvious advantage to African traders to be literate in a Western language and to have some acquaintance with European accounting practices. Many of these students therefore came to Europe through the good offices of European slave-traders operating in Africa and studied under their care in the principal slave-trade ports like Liverpool or Nantes.\nStill another peculiarity of the African communities in Europe was the fact that they were overwhelmingly male. This fact had two important implications. The African community was not self-sustaining. It had to be, and was, constantly replenished from overseas.

This, the learned counsel observed, was a cowardly act on the part of Mr. Shaw, who, it seemed, was afraid of incurring the responsibility of the detention of the vessel, and the damages he would have had to pay if he had himself put the vessel into court. Mr. Shaw had therefore passed his prize over to Mr. Dunlop, who, being an officer in the English Navy, it was expected that the British Government would back him with English money, which would not have been the case with Mr. Shaw, who was only a colonial officer. But he (Mr. Rainy) would predict that the English Government would do no such thing after they had perused the evidence of Lieutenant Dunlop, which his (Mr. Rainy's) client would bring under the notice of the Lords of the Admiralty. It was a matter of surprise to him (Mr. Rainy) that an old practitioner like Mr. Dougan had advised the seizure of the vessel before perusing the ship's papers, and afterwards arraigned her before this court upon the materials detailed in evidence. He (Mr. Dougan) knew that Mr. Heddle, one of our leading men in this community, and a member of the Legislative Council, was the consignee of the vessel, and yet no application whatever was made by Mr. Dougan to Mr. Heddle for any information about the ship! Was this a proper proceeding? He (Mr. Rainy) could not help remarking that Mr. Dougan had some latent motive for what he had done, and that the evidence showed that as regards Mr. Shaw and Lieutenant Dunlop, that they fully understood each other. The prize was large; if the ship and cargo were condemned, Lieutenant Dunlop would get about 3,000l. for his share, and it therefore became necessary to use any means to condemn the ship. Was this the way to treat the ship of a friendly nation? When these proceedings were published, foreign vessels would keep clear of this port, and the result would be that our trade with foreign countries would receive a severe check. The learned gentleman then read the correspondence that had passed between the owners of the vessel in respect to this very voyage, and Messrs. Frederick Huth and Co., and other eminent London merchants, and the Honourable Charles Heddle of this colony, and challenged the other side to make out anything but a lawful voyage out of the correspondence. Then, with regard to the equipment of the vessel, objected to on the other side, Mr. Rainy said that it had already appeared, and he would be able further to show, that the alleged slave deck was a permanent second deck, built with the ship and referred to in her register. That the empty casks were intended to be filled with palm oil, as appeared by the correspondence and the certificate of the Chamber of Commerce and Arts at Genoa (countersigned by the Customs Authorities there and by the British and French Consuls). Then, as to the boilers, he (Mr. Rainy) would be able to show that instead of being too many they were not enough for the use of the ship. The two guns, eighteen rifles, and eleven small kegs of powder (which would not make two barrels), objected to as articles of slave-trade equipment, were so ridiculous that he did not consider them worthy of serious notice. The learned gentleman concluded by protesting against the conduct of Lieut. Dunlop in going on board the ship with armed sailors, seizing her, and illegally keeping armed men on board the ship for eight days without any authority from the civil power. The ship was seized on the 3rd August by Lieut. Dunlop, who did so according to his own evidence, without having seen any of the ship's papers. He did not then put the ship into Court at once, or ask the aid of the civil authorities in the matter, but continued on board with armed men until the 11th August, when this Court first heard of the seizure. The proceedings of this young officer, he (the learned Counsel) hoped, would be seriously dealt with by his official superiors when they were laid before them. He asked the Court, therefore, to dismiss the suit with damages and costs.

In December the American schooner Joseph Nickerson went ashore on Shark's Point. The crew did all in their power to get her off, but almost as soon as she struck large numbers of armed natives surrounded the vessel in canoes, cutting the cable which had been put out to warp off the ship, and left her in a very awkward position. The mate and four of the crew took a boat, with some difficulty managed to get clear of the savages, and went to Banana for assistance; but they reached there too late to do anything that night. The next day a pilot connected with a Dutch factory there manned seven boats with a number of whites—agents, clerks, and others—all well armed, and they pulled to the scene of the wreck. The natives, however, being alarmed by such a formidable display of strength, did not wait for them to come up, but made for the shore and disappeared. It was found that the ship had been thoroughly ransacked and plundered. She had 250 bags of coffee on board, and the natives had carried off 120 bags, but being unable to take all, they had knocked the heads out of some tar barrels and emptied them over the remainder, which were thus completely spoiled. They also took away the cabin fittings, doors, and boards, and chopped off the wheel level with the deck. The sails they cut down and distributed among themselves. After the mate and crew left for Banana the natives boarded the schooner, and insisted on taking off the captain and steward, who remained, and on the way to the beach they made several attempts to drown them by overturning the boat. Fortunately, they were not successful, and next morning, when the boats arrived from Banana, the two men were seen standing on the beach with nothing on them but their singlets and drawers, all their other clothes having been stolen. The captain and crew of the wrecked schooner returned to Banana, from which place they were taken in the steamer Ethiopia to Loanda, where they laid their case before the American Consul. A consultation afterwards took place between the British and American Consuls, the result of which was that a strict investigation was commenced, with a view to discover and punish the offending natives.""}, {'id': 4662, 'article_title': 'Gambia—Bathurst, River Gambia—Liberia—West African Gold Fields—Affairs in Ashanti—Wreck and Plunder of a Ship at Grand Popo', 'full_section_title': 'Gambia—Bathurst, River Gambia—Liberia—West African Gold Fields—Affairs in Ashanti—Wreck and Plunder of a Ship at Grand Popo', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1883#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_08_1883', 'content': ""Dear Sir,—When will some natives of this country be persuaded to see their folly in plundering vessels?

The master allowed one knot per hour for currents, which at the time he thought sufficient, but the result showed that he had not made sufficient allowance. A sufficiently satisfactory cast might have been obtained with a 28lb. lead to have warned the officer in charge that he was running into danger, supposing the lead to have been properly used. The second officer, when he took charge, assumed, as he might fairly do, that the ship was in a proper position, but at 12.30 a.m., finding that the course the ship was then steering would take him too close to the land, he altered it a point to the southward, which was so far good, but not sufficient, and it was undoubtedly then his duty to have reported the alteration to the master.

A look-out was properly placed on the forecastle, and the officer was on the bridge. The look-out man saw the trees and the surf, but did not report them.

The instructions were sent to the Royalist by cable, so that no time would be lost in chastising the natives for their hostile conduct to the crew and passengers of the wrecked vessel. There is but one factory at Tabou, and it is stated that the plundering of the cargo and passengers' effects, as well as the threatening of the lives of those on board the Senegal, was done by the natives living in the bush. The occupants of the trading factory, which is owned by Mr. Julio, a European, gave the shipwrecked people refuge on their premises, and their conduct was in strong contrast to that of the bush people. The latest report from the Senegal was that she was breaking up. It was felt that the visit of the Royalist would have a salutary effect, particularly as the British war vessels are said to have been somewhat apathetic in interfering where it was thought British interests were menaced; whilst, on the other hand, the French and Germans have been very energetic in respect of the concerns of their own countrymen. The Acorn, a smaller gunboat, received the first instruction to visit Tabou. She was then lying at Bathurst.

It appears that there is only one trading factory at Tabou, which is owned by a white man named Fitzwilliam Julio. This gentleman was absent when the Senegal was wrecked, but soon afterwards returned to the coast and called together the chiefs of the bush people, who had plundered the cargo and passengers. Mr. Julio held a palaver of a week's duration, and informed the natives of the serious nature of their conduct, and also that a British war vessel had been ordered to make inquiries, if not to burn down their villages. Mr. Julio managed to collect from the natives a number of documents belonging to the Senegal, and also a portion of the mails, but many had been destroyed by the natives, who were not aware of their value. The Icarus subsequently arrived, and, aided by Mr. Julio, the captain at once set about an investigation of the matter, a report of which will be submitted to the home authorities in due course. The captain evidently had no instructions to punish the natives; at all events, nothing was done by the Icarus to them. Tabou is an independent country, contiguous to the Liberian territory. The territory, however, is claimed by the Liberians, although the chiefs state they have documents which prove its independence. Reports had been made by the Liberian authorities to the captain of the Icarus that dynamite and other dangerous explosives had been imported into Tabou by Mr. Julio and his agents in order to incite the people of Tabou and Cavally against the neighbouring territory of Liberia. This matter was also investigated by the captain of the Icarus, and was found to be groundless, so far as the importation of dynamite was concerned, and the inciting of the natives to war. Cargo of so dangerous a nature as dynamite is not carried by the English steamers, and consequently could not be imported. It was also shown that the natives were desirous of living peaceably, so long as no designs were made upon their territory, or any attempt made by the Liberians to assume authority over it and impose duties. The wreck of the Senegal had entirely disappeared, owing to the action of the current where she stranded, and nothing can now be seen of her.

The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

But little difficulty usually marks the voyage of the British vessel, and in most cases the landing of the goods is safely accomplished. It is the negro trader who receives, as a sort of middleman, the European merchandise which he has to sell on the spot, or transfer into the interior, who has to encounter a host of difficulties arising from the barbarous character of the country and the tribal jealousies which prevail. Hence, rather than encounter the danger of loss through the absurd country customs characteristic of many parts, the exacting demands made by petty chieftains in others, and the physical difficulties on land and water, the English-speaking negro confines his commercial operations to those rivers where he is tolerably sure of securing protection, because of treaties made between the English colonial governors and the native chieftains. If he goes beyond treaty ground, as he sometimes does, he may encounter loss, as the colonial authority is powerless to secure compensation without the exhibition of force.

If it be true that the German ships have occasionally been guilty of promiscuously shelling the coast, ""simply to overawe the natives,"" we can hardly wonder at the influence obtained by these Arab traders. In the ordinary way there is not much reason for this alliance between the natives and the Arabs—as the intercourse of the latter is generally confined to kidnapping and enslaving the former. But the presence of a common enemy is sure to drive them into alliance together. And let us remember the native mind does not grasp the difference between one European power and another. It is not in the interests of the Arab to enlighten them—on the contrary, it is clearly to his advantage to persuade them that all Europeans are bent upon their destruction. The Arab influence in East Africa is already immense. The chief obstacle to its further development lies in the hostility of the native tribes, who have trusted Europeans in preference, because they found that these have been just and considerate; but according to latest accounts, the Germans seem bent upon changing all this, and forcing the natives to make common cause with the Arabs.

These pontoons, which form sections of the vessel, and each of which is water-tight and therefore floatable in itself, are placed side by side and fastened together, and to them is added a bow-piece and a stern-piece. The whole forms a hull 70 ft. long by 18 ft. beam. The sections are so bolted together that they can be readily disunited and as readily put together again. On the bow division are placed two steam boilers of the locomotive type, and capable of working up to 150 lb. per square inch. The boilers have very capacious fire grates for burning wood, which will, of course, be the only fuel procurable. On the stern division are the engines, which are designed for a working pressure of 140 lb. per square inch. There are two cylinders, one on either side of the vessel, each 10½ in. diameter and 2 ft. 6 in. stroke. The piston rod of each cylinder is connected with a crank shaft, carrying a stern paddle-wheel 10 ft. diameter and 12 ft. breast, and placed well aft of the vessel. The strains on the boat which arise from these weights being placed at either end, are taken by a system of light steel tie-rods, by means of which the whole of the vessel is well braced. The ship is fitted with a pair of balanced rudders, and is steered from a bridge placed well forward and about 12 ft. above the water, giving the steersman a good view all round. Above the main deck, and completely covering it, will be found a wooden awning deck, which in an African climate will be necessary to protect the passengers and crew from the sun. On the main deck is a small, well-ventilated saloon. On the occasion of the preliminary trial recently a number of engineers and scientific gentlemen were present. The vessel was put through several interesting manoeuvres, the most striking of which was rapid turning, for which Le Stanley showed remarkable aptitude, indicating great steering capabilities which render her admirably suited for tortuous and winding rivers. Her mean draught was 14 in. in working trim, and, with a steam pressure of 100 lb. per square inch, a speed of from nine and a half to ten miles per hour was obtained.\n\nThe hindrances hitherto experienced in the development of trade with Africa have been due in a great measure to the practical difficulties met with in placing vessels of light draught on the rivers.

Not only did the British government refuse to see the Asante mission but, while it was still there, instructed the governor on the coast to issue an ultimatum to the Asantehene to receive a British Resident and pay the war indemnity of 50000 oz of gold imposed on Asante in 1874. Of course, the Asantehene refused to comply with these requests, all the more so since he was awaiting the outcome of the mission to London.\nUsing this as an excuse, the British launched a full-scale expedition against Asante under the command of Sir Francis Scott. This expedition entered Kumasi in January 1896 without firing a shot since Prempeh and his advisors had decided not to fight the British but to accept British protection. In spite of this, Prempeh, his mother who was also then the Queen, his uncles and some of the war chiefs were arrested and deported first to Sierra Leone and thence to the Seychelles Islands in 1900. 44 (See Plate 6.2.)"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.604, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'Conquest and reaction in British West Africa, 1880-1900 > Asante (Gold Coast)', 'content': ""Why did the Asante decide not to fight the British on this occasion?

Added to this, he had developed several tactics, such as constantly moving from one town to another, pitting one European nation, company or individual against another, and postponing decisions to frustrate impatient concessionaires. As a longer-range strategy, he sought either military alliance or protectorate status with the British government to counter the Germans, Portuguese and Afrikaners, and so prevent uncontrolled South African colonial expansion.\nThese forms of diplomatic resistance apparently worked effectively until 1888, when the South African financier, Cecil John Rhodes, convinced Sir Hercules Robinson, the High Commissioner, and Sir Sidney Shippard, the Deputy Commissioner for Bechuanaland, to enlist the help of the Reverend John Smith Moffat. Moffat had left Matabeleland in 1865 after totally failing to convert the Ndebele. He had ultimately become Shippard's assistant commissioner.

Its adjustment to changing times was noticeable from the mid-century when, under the influence of a French trading firm, Victor RØgis, King Gezo (c. 1818-58) of Dahomey was persuaded to intensify the trade in palm oil, first as a supplement to the export of slaves and eventually as the dominant factor in the state's export economy.$^{41}$ The transition from slave to 'legi› timate' trade meant a corresponding increase in the need to retain war captives as labour for the maintenance and expansion of the palm oil industry.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858.

In some cases the dominant class emerged stronger as a result of economic and military ties to the slave-traders. Consider relations between the Bemba rulers and the Arab and Swahili traders. Under the leadership of Chileshe Chipela the Bemba had just completed a phase of territorial expansion and political centralization when the foreign traders entered their homeland around i860. As a result, the Bemba kingdom was far more unified and powerful than most states in the region. The geographical position of the Bemba, somewhat removed from the principal trade routes, precluded the growth of a large and potentially seditious merchant community within the core of their kingdom. Equally important, there was no incentive for the Arab and Swahili traders to adopt a hostile posture since the Bemba were not economic rivals. Most of the royal families' wealth came from raiding and tribute in the form of ivory and slaves and they were happy to exchange them for the cloth and other imported goods provided by the coastal merchants. This economic complementarity fostered a harmonious relationship and simultaneously enhanced the internal position of the Bemba aristocracy, which used the foreign commodities to recruit new followers and strengthen their links to subordinate chiefs. The continued demand for captives and ivory also fuelled a new expansionist phase from i860 to 1880, during which Bemba forces conquered most of contemporary north-eastern Zambia. Thus, through ties to foreign merchants, the Bemba rulers gained unprecedented regional power while accumulating a substantial amount of wealth. 43 As in the case of the Bemba, other local chiefs and merchants entered into alliances with the slave-traders that proved extremely beneficial. Throughout the 1870s the Chewa chief, Mwase Kasungu, whose territory straddled the Lake Malawi-Katanga trade route, provided food for the Arab caravans in exchange for guns. These weapons enabled him to withstand the subsequent Mbwela Nguni invasions.$^{44}$ Economic con› siderations also motivated Arab and Swahili protection of the Senga chiefs, who were important suppliers of ivory.$^{45}$ Similar factors help explain Chikunda alliances with the Ambo against the Bemba, and assistance that they provided the Nsenga against the Soli, which occurred in the decade preceding the 'Scramble'.$^{46}$ In all these cases, it is clear that the aliens' strategy was to prevent"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.602, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Niger delta > The eastern delta', 'content': 'In addition to the British consuls and naval officers on the coast, British traders and missionaries tried to get into the hinterland, for example, by sponsoring voyages of exploration. Many decades of British efforts to discover the course and sources of the Niger river were crowned with success when Richard and John Lander were brought from Aboh to Nembe (Brass) by its ruler, King Boy Amain, in 1830. Once the estuaries of the many rivers of the Niger delta were shown to be the entrance to the great Niger river, British interest was greatly increased in the area as a highway into the rich interior of Nigeria and West Africa. British traders, such as Macgregor Laird, as well as humanitarians and missionaries tried to move up the delta into the hinterland between the 1830s and 1850s.\nIn the eastern delta itself, the Church Missionary Society under the leadership of the Nigerian ex-slave, Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther, estab› lished missions at Bonny in 1864, at Twon-Brass in the Nembe kingdom in 1868, at Elem Kalahari (New Calabar in the documents) in 1874, and at Okrika in 1880. Both at Bonny and Nembe, the rulers invited the missionaries for a number of reasons. Some wished to have the missionaries establish schools in which their children could learn to read, write and speak English in order to carry on their commercial relations with British firms. It was also believed that permission for the missionaries would lead to better relations with the British government, represented by the consuls and naval officers, and serve to strengthen them against neighbouring states in internal power struggles. These same reasons sometimes led to the missionaries being rejected in other parts of the eastern delta. Thus, once the Church Missionary Society was established at Bonny, Jaja of Opobo, who had broken away from Bonny in 1869 to form his state of Opobo, would have nothing to do with that mission. The establishment of Christian missions was, however, resisted by powerful interests within each of the delta states, and Christianity constituted a factor of social instability in the nineteenth century.

In particular, the British wanted to secure the support of the ruler for the abolition of the slave trade, since Madagascar was one of the main sources of slaves in the region. It was Sir Robert's desire, therefore, to pursue an active political role in Madagascar. This policy, coinciding as it did with Radama's own determination to expand to the east, was to have, as one writer has put it, 'important consequences for the future of Madagascar'. 12 After several friendly contacts, Farquhar sent a diplomatic mission, led by Captain Le Sage, which arrived in Antananarivo on 21 December 1816. A treaty of friendship and commerce was eventually signed on 4 February 1817 between Radama and Le Sage. But this treaty did not satisfy the Mauritian Governor because it did not mention the slave trade, a matter of considerable importance to Sir Robert. The Governor therefore sent another mission to Radama's capital, this time led by James Hastie, a former Sergeant at Arms in India and more experienced in handling negotiations with oriental rulers.$^{13}$ Hastie brought along with him a number of gifts for the king, including horses, a compass, a map of the world and a chiming clock, all of which greatly impressed the young king and helped Hastie to win his love and confidence. The negotiations, however, stumbled over the British insistence that Radama should outlaw the slave trade in Madagascar. When Radama argued that by doing this he would be com› mitting economic suicide because the slave trade was the major source of his revenue, Hastie had a ready answer: the British would pay the Malagasy ruler an annual sum of 1000 dollars in gold, 1000 dollars in silver, a hundred barrels of gunpowder, 100 English muskets with 100 flints, 400 soldiers' uniforms, 12 sergeants' swords, 600 pieces of cloth, a full-dress uniform for himself and 2 horses as compensation.$^{14}$ Radama considered that he had made a fair deal, especially since the treaty also recognized him as king of the whole of Madagascar.

The African-Aid Society have especially reason to congratulate themselves on the justness of their views with regard to Dahomey. It is now more than two years since they memorialised Her Majesty's Government to send a commissioner to the King of that country. Although assailed on all sides by doubts as to the personal safety of any person who might be thus sent, they have never wavered, and at every convenient opportunity have reiterated that request. Their information respecting both King and people was too certain to allow them to participate in any fear. They knew that what the King desired in his heart, above all other things, was, that some Englishman, clothed with command, and bringing a direct message from the British Government, should come to him. His pride and dignity were involved in his obtaining this virtual recognition from England, similar to that which his father had received. Their memorial prayed, moreover, that, if necessary, a subsidy might be granted to the King, to cease whenever legitimate trade should have brought him a revenue equal to that he would have abandoned in giving up and assisting us in destroying the slave-trade, at our request.\n\nThe reception of Commodore Wilmot by the King of Dahomey, his chiefs and people, has set at rest the question of the accessibility of that monarch to the remonstrances and counsels of England. Our prestige there is very great. All were jealous of the preference which we seemed to give to Abeokuta. That envenomed the feelings of the Dahomans against the Abeokutans, and the very decided terms in which the former spoke to Commodore Wilmot on the subject show that there is but little chance of peace between the two until the issues of another foray into the Egba country shall have been tried. We deeply deplore that Commodore Wilmot could not obtain an abandonment of the King's designs against Abeokuta. But, notwithstanding the state of isolation from England in which the Abeokutans have placed themselves, by their unjustifiable and offensive rejection of Mr. Vice-Consul Taylor, and their subsequent proceedings, they ought to be perfectly able to protect their town against troops on whom a three weeks' march without commissariat supplies must tell with most enfeebling effect.""}, {'id': 294, 'article_title': 'DAHOMEY', 'full_section_title': 'DAHOMEY', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1864#article-9', 'issue_date': '23_01_1864', 'content': 'Our advices from Whydah are to December 4, at which date Her Majesty\'s steamship Rattlesnake, bearing the flag of Commodore Wilmot, was lying off that place.

On the morning of the 4th, three messengers, who had been sent down from Abomey by the King expressly with that object, were conveyed on board the Rattlesnake. The messengers were bearers of the King\'s stick, and charged to compliment the Commodore on his arrival, as well as to present him with a bullock, a goat, some fowls, yams, &c. The King\'s greeting to Commodore Wilmot was ""To his best friend!""\n\nOur correspondent, who had gone on board the Rattlesnake to see the interview, &c., informs us that the scene at the time of the presentation of the ""stick"" was very interesting. None of these people, nor anybody belonging to the King, had ever ventured to go upon the sea before. The compliment was therefore so much the greater, as it was an entire departure from the customs of the country, as hitherto observed. All who have the pleasure of knowing Commodore Wilmot personally, will know how very much is implied when our correspondent says that he received the messengers, with their presents, in a most kind, considerate, and gentlemanly manner. He conducted them all over the ship, and showed, and, as far as possible, explained to them all about her engines. These last were objects of their unbounded admiration and astonishment. These, they said, ""never could have been made by man;"" and added that if any one on shore could have explained such things as those, they would never have been believed. An Armstrong gun was fired for them. This they declared carried the shot six miles—i.e., a distance equal to six English miles. The Commodore feasted them well, made them some handsome presents, and gave them a sufficiency of good wine, and sent them on shore in high good humour. Our correspondent, who saw them afterwards, says that they were too much amazed and delighted with everything that the King\'s best friend, ""the king of the ships,"" had shown them, that they did not know how to express themselves, but went back to Abomey full of wonder and admiration, to tell the King all that they had seen and heard.\n\nThe Commodore, our friend says, sent a good preparatory message to the King, advising him most earnestly, as a friend, to listen to all that Captain Burton would have to say to him. We cannot help thinking that this happy visit on board such a ship as the Rattlesnake will have produced an impression that may greatly aid Captain Burton\'s persuasions, and tend to incline the King to such a change as we desire.'}]","[{'document_title': 'DAHOMEY', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Our correspondent at Whydah informs us that, early in August, Commodore Wilmot was off Godomey, in the Rattlesnake. A messenger of the King of Dahomey went to him from Whydah, with special directions to see the Commodore *with his own eyes.* The following is the substance of the message he was charged to deliver: ""The King sends his best regards to the Commodore, and wishes him to come to Abomey. He does not like Captain Burton, and would not make a treaty with him, after having refused his friend the Commodore. The King will tell the Commodore all he wants, if he will come up to Abomey, and will send a message to the Queen of England.""\n\nAs on a previous occasion, the messenger was extremely well received by Commodore Wilmot, who, however, according to our informant, returned a rather severe, though wise and conciliatory, reply. It is understood to have been to this effect:—\n\n""Tell the King that I am glad to hear he is well, and give him my compliments. Tell him further that it is not likely the English Government will send another messenger to Abomey, because the King\'s conduct is not such as to prove that he is sincere. Presents have been made to him, and offers of friendship have been held out to him, with a real desire on the part of England to benefit Dahomey and Africa. We cannot go on in this ridiculous way. The King must give up the slave-trade, or he must prepare to see his ports blockaded, which must very soon have the desired effect, because all those things which are absolutely necessary to him now will be prevented from reaching the shore. He cannot live or feed his people without those things. He will not be able to sell his slaves, because they cannot be shipped. His wars with Abeokuta and others are consuming the strength of his kingdom, because many are killed, many made prisoners, many die—and who can replace them. If I stop his supplies, how can he exist? There is no cultivation and no produce of the soil. He and his people will starve, and his kingdom will be broken up. Tell him that all the kings and tribes round Dahomey are his enemies, and that if once the English blockade his coast they will be glad of the opportunity to rise against him and destroy him. Perhaps Abeokuta will do this. Who can say? Be sure you tell the King truly all that I have said, and that the advice of his best friend is that he should at once send his principal chiefs to Whydah, and make the treaty with me that the Queen of England requires.""\n\nOur correspondent says that the messenger acknowledged that all the Commodore had said was true—and there can be no doubt that he will faithfully report every word of it to the King.

Had his father abolished these evil practices, his Majesty said, he would not have resumed them; but as they had not been abolished previously to his entering on the kingdom, he could not venture to set them aside.\n\nMr. Bernasko was much interested in the fate of the remaining captives taken at Ishagga, and hoped to obtain their release; but was informed that they had died from the effects of their diet while in captivity. He put his own construction on this story.\n\nOne hopeful circumstance, however, appeared. The King seemed wishful to receive communications from the Government of England, and disappointed that those which had been opened with his father had not been continued. There seems reason to think that a properly-accredited messenger would not be unwelcome; and should the duties of his mission be judiciously discharged, it is possible that much good might result. The subject deserves the best consideration of Her Majesty\'s Government, with a view to some immediate action that might be instrumental in averting the threatened attack from Abeokuta.

He hoped the Government would act with firmness in the matter.\n\nThe Earl of Kimberley was not acquainted with the full details of what had taken place, but if the King of Dahomey had committed the outrage attributed to him, and had refused reparation, he did not see that the Government could have acted otherwise. He should like to have further information as to how far the blockade was likely to prove successful. Our position on the Gold Coast was not to be treated with indifference. England was practically the only European Power on the Coast, and though the French had some small ports on the Coast, on us depended the promotion of European civilization in that district of country. In case of the blockade not fulfilling expectation, we might find the people of Abeokuta useful allies; and the King of Dahomey had been twice or thrice foiled in his attempts against that country, so that he would be likely to think twice before giving fresh provocation.\n\nLord Cardwell thought it of great importance that the King of Dahomey should understand that we were in earnest in this matter.

We are not of those who had thus feared, but of those who, looking to the future welfare of Dahomey itself, as well as of the countries bordering upon it, have rather hoped that the King would be infatuated enough to give cause for operations against him that would destroy at once and for ever a rule that daily outrages humanity, and is a bitter curse to all that portion of West Africa over which its desolating influence extends. The atrocities committed at Abomey and the desolating kidnapping annual expeditions into neighbouring territories which supply the victims, are not results of the personal character of any one individual Dahoman king, but the unvarying results of a system which will endure so long as the Dahoman rule is continued. On the ground of humanity alone it would well become the British Government to put an end at once and for ever to that rule; but we are not so Quixotic as to suppose for a moment that this could possibly happen. We therefore looked with pleasure on the complications that arose at Whydah, owing to the application of a diluted specimen of Dahoman barbarity to a British subject, who happened to be not so absorbingly a trader as to sink all sense of personal dignity for the sake of pounds, shillings, and pence; but complained of the treatment to which he had been subjected, and appealed to his own Government for redress. The Commodore (Sir William Hewett), as representing that Government, inflicted a fine on Dahomey which we felt convinced the King\'s besotted ignorance and pride would not allow him to pay, or rather order to be paid. The news now brought, justifies thus far our view of the case. The British Government, in most properly sanctioning and adopting the decision of their Commodore, have now gone so far that they cannot recede, but must go much further if the King should continue to brave their power. We hope they will not be deterred by any unfounded apprehension of meeting with a repetition of the difficulties and obstacles which had to be encountered in the advance on the capital of Ashanti. Abomey is only half the distance from the coast that had to be traversed to arrive at Coomassie, or Kumasi; while the country is comparatively open, and, with the exception of a limited tract of swamp (which need not necessarily be traversed, but may be skirted), presents really no obstacles to a rapid march on the capital. Nor is the opposing force, however terrible it may be to neighbouring peoples comparatively unarmed, either in number or quality such as could stand before even a very small number of British soldiers and sailors armed with weapons and accompanied by artillery which modern science has made so terribly destructive. The war, if there be a war, will be a very little one, and very speedily terminated; while the prize to be obtained is one of considerable magnitude, and one that must necessarily, sooner or later, be obtained, because it is indispensable to the beneficial progress of British civilizing rule in West Africa. We may be excused for again reminding our readers that when the Gold Coast Colony, as now administratively existing, was constituted by proclamation after the conclusion of the Ashanti War, we recorded at once our conviction that although there was not any such intention in the minds of the British Government, the inevitable result must be the bringing within the Protectorate of what a writer in the Standard, who has adopted our views, justly designates ""little wrecking, smuggling kinglets"" intervening between our actual Gold Coast territory and Whydah, and the further subjection of the entire seaboard thence to Lagos. The Gold Coast Colony will thenceforward, whenever this absorption has taken place, show commercial and financial results which will astonish those who have been accustomed to oppose all territorial acquisitions in West Africa as worthless and unproductive of aught but trouble. The period of development of a large extent of territory will then fairly commence. Dahomey, once freed from the oppressing, withering rule of its present Government, will offer large results to trade and commerce, Lagos will take high rank in trade, and the Gold Coast Colony revenues will be such as will allow of the construction of works such as have been found effective in other countries for stimulating and increasing production. It will be a great mistake not to make the most of the opportunity which the King of Dahomey now affords the British Government of a profitable extension of territorial rule. There is one point, however, to which we hope due attention will be given should an advance by British forces on Abomey become necessary. The advance would be incalculably facilitated by a public pledge on the part of the British Government to annex and occupy the seaboard as we have suggested. The Whydahs, who have always groaned under the Dahoman yoke, and who even made a movement for emancipation about two years ago, would at once unite their efforts with those of the invading force, if they were certain that they would not subsequently be again handed over to the Dahomans. We could not expect them to give aid and assistance under any other conditions. Since they fell to the Dahomans by conquest, they have realized, alas! but too fully, the weight of their exterminating oppressed people, and later, when they shall have served up.\n**31**', 'last_edit_date': '1876-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1876#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'West Coast of Africa News', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""WEST COAST OF AFRICA NEWS.\n\n**THE BLOCKADE OF DAHOMEY.**—The African Steamship Company's steamer Ambriz, which arrived in the Mersey on Nov. 15, reports that trade on the coast is still very bad.

In the article in our May number before alluded to we exposed the error and inconsistency of such a refusal as had been given to the King, and endeavoured once again to show how much that change which we so desire for Dahomey and Ashantee might possibly be forwarded by bringing some of the chief men of those countries into immediate personal contact with our advanced civilisation and all the humane institutions to which the blessed precepts of the Gospel of Peace have given rise among us. There is nothing more necessary to be shown to the authorities of those barbarous countries than the value which we attach to human life; and that although unhappily wars have not ceased among so-called Christian nations, human life is, except upon the battle-field, regarded as a sacred thing, in no case to be wantonly taken away, and in all cases to be hedged round by the supreme authority with all possible protections. We do not know what may be the decision of our Government, and what answer may be sent to the King of Dahomey. We have reason, however, to believe that the arguments put forward by us have not been without effect in modifying opinions in quarters where opposition to the King of Dahomey\'s wishes was known to exist. There is consequently reason to hope that a favourable answer may be accorded, at least to the extent of meeting the King\'s wishes that some of his chiefs should come over to this country, by offering those facilities without which it would be difficult, if not impossible, for them to do so. This, and a formal reception of such envoys by Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, are two very different things. If the latter could by any possibility be construed into an approval of, or even into a cessation of protest against, those horrible barbarities by which Dahomey is polluted, especially in those superstitious ""Customs"" in which human life is so wantonly destroyed, we should say at once that such envoys should not be admitted, either formally or informally, to the Royal presence; but if, as we think there is reason to believe, the personal displeasure of our Sovereign at such atrocities, pronounced by herself in presence of those envoys, might have the effect of inducing the King to put an end at once and for ever to his slave wars and to those appalling ""Customs"" for which Dahomey has become so infamously distinguished, we do venture to express the hope that in the event of the envoys arriving here, some means may be devised by which they may thus become assured of Her Majesty\'s abhorrence of things in which the Kings of Dahomey have delighted, and that Her Majesty considers those things in which they have gloried as incompatible with the existence of any friendly understanding, or interchange of courtesies between herself and him. We do think that some means may be devised by which such a Royal Christian effort might be made in the cause of humanity and of Christian civilisation in Africa without any sacrifice of Royal dignity. The end in view is really a great one. The cessation of slave-hunting wars and of ""Customs"" in Dahomey, and the entry of that country, however feeble at first its steps may be, into the ranks of the world\'s advancing Christian civilisation, would have a great effect on the surrounding countries. A new way would be opened through Dahomey into the interior of Africa. And as the Dahoman Government has long since shown itself alive to the importance of good roads between its principal places, more might possibly be done within a short time in that than in any other native African country in establishing improved communications between the coast and the interior. The visit of the Dahoman envoys to this country, and their judicious reception and entertainment here, are therefore much to be desired. It would be absurd, of course, to bring them over at this time of the year, when they would be exposed to the rigours of winter; but we hope that such an answer may be given to the King\'s application, and such instructions be issued and arrangements made, as may lead to the presence of those men among us some time in the months of May or June of next year.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-09-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_09_1866#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'DAHOMEY', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Whydah, Dahomey, March 31, 1868.\n\nSir,—There can be no doubt of the continuing desire of the King of Dahomey to send some of his principal chiefs on a visit to England.

Thereafter, up to about 1906, over 18000 New World Africans mostly aided by the ACS settled, annually, in Liberia in congeries of over thirty towns close to the Atlantic littoral on land obtained by the ACS or the Liberian government from the African chiefs of the region. Almost all of them were Afro-Americans, but at least 400 were Afro-West Indians from Barbados who emigrated in 1865 and settled together at Crozierville, 13 km inland from Monrovia.

The themes of African redemption through American black missionaries were another.\nAfricans themselves, however, created the context of their next interaction with American blacks as they matriculated at American, largely Afro-American, schools and attended pan-African conferences and the like. Consequently, many Africans underwent a technical-educationalpolitical experience alien to their colonial world. When they re-entered their own worlds, many felt driven to resolve questions of ideology, cultural definition, educational values, political power, and pan-African unity or consciousness, guided by new perspectives.\nViewed against such an historical backdrop, the numerous pan-African conferences, Tuskegean educational and technical projects, the nØgritude movement and the occasional focus on American blacks in African millen› nial dreams, all illustrate the consistency of the pan-African theme among American and Caribbean blacks. They also show the variability of African responses to the New World overtures and ultimately the shaping by Africans themselves of these overtures to fit African specifications.\nIn sum, the populations of the African diaspora and the motive charac› terizing the many interactions between persons of the first and second black worlds included two visions. One was a vision of the union of religious forces among black populations in Africa and America or the reconstruction of Africa through importation of American and Antillean black technical expertise, initiated at the behest of American blacks.

Delany, was continued and enlarged upon in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.

Blyden, visited the United States from Liberia on behalf of the American Colonization Society (ACS) to help generate black support for emigration. Moreover, between 1880 and 1900, Bishop Henry NcNeal Turner laboured to combine the two traditions long dominant in the modern history of African/Afro-American interaction: African emigration and Christian evangelism. Similarly, widespread interaction between Africans and American blacks occurred because of the return of thousands of Brazilian blacks to West Africa until the time of the official abolition of slavery in Brazil (1888). Upon resettlement in or near their previous homes in Nigeria, Dahomey (now Benin), Togo and the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the Afro-Brazilians' technical and commercial competence and political aspirations seem to have broadly affected the social, economic and political conditions there.

Throughout the nineteenth century, Americo-Liberians' policy was to assimilate the indigenous Africans culturally and politically by 'civilizing' and Christianizing them, and giving them equal rights with the settlers. Although this was achieved to some extent with the Recaptives (who were much less numerous than the settlers), the Americo-Liberians, mindful of their own privileged position, main› tained tight political control over Liberia by restricting political participa› tion of even those indigenous Africans who were educated. Only very few of them were given the franchise on an equal footing with the AmericoLiberians (although these might themselves be illiterate and poor). The main indigenous African representation (mostly of the coastal Africans) in the Liberian Legislature as from 1875 consisted of African chiefs designated 'referees' (or 'delegates'), after their chiefdoms had paid an annual 'delegate fee' of $100 to the Liberian government. As the delegates 'spoke' through an interpreter solely on ethnic matters and could not vote, they had very little influence on government policy.$^{8}$ Hence both the educated Africans and the chiefs resented their restricted representation. Furthermore the Liberian government sought to maximize its import and export duties and other levies on trade and shipping which constituted its main sources of revenue. To facilitate collection and control of the external trade by Americo-Liberian merchants, from 1839 the government restricted foreign merchants to trade at only six Americo-Liberian portsof-entry. The restrictions and levies alienated both the foreign merchants who resented them, and the indigenous African chiefs who had formerly controlled the external trade and levied the dues. Often, the foreign merchants and chiefs combined to resist or defy the trade restrictions and levies, or to appeal to European states to intervene on their behalf. Thus, at various times during the nineteenth century, the Vai, Kru and Grebo of the Liberian coast put up an armed resistance to Liberian government impositions on their trade. 9"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Economic and social change in Liberia and Ethiopia, 1915-35 > Liberia', 'content': ""and exploitation like filching government funds or extorting from the indigenous Liberian population.

Few responded, although a group did organize the African Development Society in 1899, the chief objective of which was to encourage Afro-Americans to buy land and settle in East Central Africa. The Society would sell shares or land rights offered by African petitioners but only to Afro-American or African purchasers. 4 Bishop Turner also later served as an adviser to the International Migration Society (IMS) of Alabama, which sent about 500 emigrants to Africa before it became defunct in 1900. Some of the 500 remained in Liberia; others returned to the United States. Those who remained fared reasonably well; evidently more than a few of them prospered. On the other hand, those who returned told horror stories of poor land, inadequate food and poor living conditions. These stories reduced the likelihood of any large-scale Afro-American emigration movement, even though prospects for blacks in the United States were declining from 1895 to 1900. Nevertheless, numerous Afro-Americans evidently continued to give serious consider› ation to African emigration, just as others in the United States and the Caribbean simply moved away from overt discriminatory practices into other regions near by.\nAfter the turn of the twentieth century, the back-to-Africa baton was picked up by others. For example, one Captain Dean, early in the twentieth century, hoped to engineer the settlement of American blacks in South Africa to fashion a powerful black state there. After the briefest sojourn meant to arrange for this settlement, however, white authorities expelled Dean from the Cape for what were termed 'provocative activities'. And in 1914, Chief Alfred C. Sam, a Gold Coast African, turned up in Oklahoma, persuaded about sixty black farmers that Africa offered them greater oppor› tunities and sailed with them to Saltpond in the Gold Coast. Finding Chief Sam's claims to be exaggerated and encountering restrictions from the Gold Coast officials which inhibited the entry of American immigrants, most of the Oklahomans eventually returned to the United States.

In some cases, the influences from Africa were strong enough and pervasive enough to forge a genuine Afro-American culture competing with, and sometimes complementing the Europeanderived culture.\nIn the USA the political-structure imposed a rigid dichotomy between black and white in the population, relegating any individual with any degree of African ancestry to the category of black.$^{51}$ By contrast, throughout the rest of the hemisphere a three-tiered social categorization prevailed, corres› ponding to the dominant groups of black, mixed, and white.

The other European Powers, one after the other signified their recognition of the Republic. America added her recognition in 1862. President Roberts, who undertook a tour through Europe for the purpose of obtaining the recognition of the Powers, was well received in England, and was not only able to conclude a commercial treaty, but was accepted as an ally in the prosecution of the campaign against the slave trade on the West African coast, and was presented with a gunboat to enable him to carry on the repression of the traffic in Liberian waters. He, in 1849, took an active part in an expedition of the Powers against the slade traders, who had their headquarters in the northern territory lying between Liberia and Sierra Leone. It was felt that if the whole coast could be held under anti-slavery supervision the trade might be extirpated, and in 1850 the West Coast territory to Cape Turner was purchased from the owners and placed under the guardianship of Liberia. Robertsport was founded this year, and commemorates the name of the President. The population of the Republic was rapidly increasing, her territory was extended towards the interior by treaties with the chiefs, and in 1857 the colony of Maryland was by its own request annexed. They now form together the United States of Liberia. Trade and agriculture were encouraged, and order, justice, and civilised institutions spread through the Republic. The restriction by which white men were forbidden to hold land was also removed. Towns were multiplied and exploration of the interior began to attract attention.

The first independent civilized African State on the West Coast, she occupies a position of great honour and usefulness. With institutions framed on the model of those of the United States of America, she stands out boldly before the world asserting and proving that there is no lack of natural ability in the civilized African to work the machinery of free institutions. Her President, her judges, her learned professors, are Christian Africans; no white man holds any political position in the country; the nation is essentially negro, and is so far from feeling any need of European or American aid in carrying on the various departments of her government, that she does more than discourage, she prohibits the permanent settlement of white men within her borders. They may come there for purposes of trade, but they are not permitted to acquire landed property; African she is, and exclusively African she is determined to remain. The enemies and libellers of the African race not unfrequently point to Liberia with contempt and ridicule, because she has not obtained in infancy the development of manhood; because, having no capital but what has been created by the industry of her own people, she is not able to undertake those works of civilization which are so much needed for the rapid development of her great natural resources; because, amid the abundant elements of wealth existing in her rich tropical fertility, and with her capability of producing so many objects that Europe requires and is compelled to seek even at the opposite side of the world, her Government is poor, and her revenue insufficient, without constant patriotic self-denial on the part of her principal citizens, for the support of those establishments indispensable to a free Christian State, which includes within her borders a native heathen population more than twenty times exceeding in number the civilized population of which the State really consists. But so far from there being anything in her public condition to justify contempt and ridicule such as our ignorantly-learned anthropologists would heap upon her and her people, every impartial man will find cause in her for wonder and felicitation that a mere handful of people brought to the African Coast from the degrading servitude of the late Slave States of the great American Republic should have fallen into so few errors, and have made such rapid progress. For it must be especially borne in mind that no comparison between Liberia and an English colony would be fair. An English colony, however small the number of emigrants and their descendants may be, is constantly and from its very birth receiving assistance from realized British capital. But the African emigrants from the United States to Liberia have not had any such resources at their back. They or their fathers have been slaves; and their only means of reaching Liberia was by the gift of a free passage, with six months free support after arrival, by the Colonization Society which founded this refuge for emancipated slaves on the West Coast of Africa. There have been no African Crusoes to help to build up this African Republic; the wealth, whatever it may be, within her is only the surplus of what her own people have created, over and above what they required for their own support. The progress thus made must necessarily be slow in comparison with that of an English colony anywhere, although it may be, as it has been in reality, rapid when viewed only in connexion with the elements available for promoting it. But we hope and believe that the time is now approaching when that progress will be greatly stimulated. Liberia, formed of American Africans, strongly imbued with the Republican principles so extreme in the American people, is not likely to attract any new elements of wealth and population from any other country than that from which its present civilized population has been derived. Ardently desiring as we do to see a rapid advance in Liberia, we rejoiced when we foresaw, as an inevitable consequence of the civil war in the United States, an increased emigration of emancipated Africans from those states to Liberia. The extreme change in the position of the late slaves in America, who have been so suddenly elevated from a debasing bondage, from a condition in which they were estimated rather as beasts than as men, to the full privileges of citizenship, political as well as social, has, however, retarded that movement toward Africa which would otherwise have impelled large numbers of the emancipated to Liberia. Still, the desire to become citizens of an exclusively African Republic, and that in Africa, has been gradually spreading in America, and the Colonization Society, who sent a shipload of emigrants in November last, and another in May, will despatch their ship again in November next with a further addition of some 800 for the African Republic. From the published statements of the society we have reason to believe that 4,000 or 5,000 emigrants might have been sent to Liberia during the present year, instead of some 1,500, had the society been in possession of the requisite funds. We must express our hope that the Colonization Society will be able to obtain all the money it may require to realize the spontaneous desires of late American slaves to become Liberian citizens. It is only by a large increase in her civilized industrial population that Liberia can make rapid progress in production and wealth. She is limited to this source of increase by the elements of which she is composed, by the nature of her institutions, and the strong peculiarities of her people; and all who are desirous of seeing the West Coast countries and their peoples emerge from their barbarism and degradation and come within the sphere of Christian civilizing influences should assist the Colonization Society of the United States in conveying emigrants to Liberia. We had hoped that before 1870 her civilized population would there be increased to at least 50,000. She could with the assistance rendered by the society for six months after the arrival of the emigrants in Liberia have very well established the requisite number, or even a greater number, within her borders before that period could they have been sent to her; and such an addition to her civilized labourers on her coasts and the rich lands of her navigable rivers would, we are convinced, soon give to the carping libellers of the African race new and forcible evidence of the just claim of the African to the rights and sympathies of a common brotherhood with the hitherto more favoured European.', 'last_edit_date': '1867-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1867#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ANOTHER PROPOSED EXPLORATION IN THE RIVER CONGO.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The same gentleman has taken great interest in Liberia, and gave 1,000l. in aid of emigration of Africans from the United States to the West African Republic.

The French crossed the frontier of Ashantee into Liberian territory and established military stations, which they have refused to leave. Unfortunately, there is no Power to which Liberia can look for protection, unless to the United States. The country is prosperous, and is making great headway in the direction of civilization and wealth; but the fear that the Republic will be swallowed up by some European Power tends greatly to check the progress and development of the country. The Republic is a market for almost every kind of American manufactured goods and of foods. In return the United States gets its palm oil, palm kernels, dye woods, ivory, and coffee, and should a line of steamers be established to run regularly between New York and Liberia the country might become a centre for the shipping of many of the products of Africa, its chief port being convenient as a central depot from which they could be shipped to the United States. The caravans which bring ivory and other products from the interior of Monrovia return bearing American calico, bacon, and general manufactures; but as yet the only means of direct communication between Liberia and the United States is a line of sailing vessels. The mails are brought indirectly by way of England, and are very irregular.

When he ascended the throne in 1894, he seemed to be suspicious of Europeans, mostly missionaries at that time, so he sought to restrict his people's interactions with them. Those among the Baganda who had embraced the Christian faith and who would not obey his orders were put to death as traitors.$^{29}$ Today, Christians regard them as martyrs. Mwanga was, however, violently resisting attempts by British agents to take over his country even though disguised as mission› aries. But his diplomatic ability also became apparent in the way he handled various, often warring religious sects. At one time, he would play the two Christian sects, Catholics and Protestants, against Muslims when he thought the latter were becoming too powerful and therefore threatening his control of the country. At another time, he would ally with Muslims against Catholics or Protestants or both depending on who he thought was dangerous to his rule. Thus, Mwanga was adept at the diplomatic game of divide and rule, a tactic which the colonizing powers were able to use so effectively in controlling Africa. When it was necessary, Mwanga resorted to a revival of some old tradition in an attempt to drive out all foreigners as happened in 1888.$^{30}$ On this occasion, he intended to entice all foreigners and their Baganda followers to a naval parade on an island on Lake Victoria. There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler. Later, however, in 1889, Mwanga managed to regain his throne only to be exiled to Kisimayu, as already indicated, in 1899, where he died in 1903."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Niger delta > The eastern delta', 'content': ""The British consuls on the coast tried to use these inter-state wars as a lever to obtain an opening for their own traders and missionaries to move into the hinterland.

The British had clashed with King William Pepple of Bonny as early as 1854, when they exiled him to Fernando Po, Ascension, Sierra Leone and London. They used disturbances caused by local feuds as an excuse. In 1887 they could find no such excuse when they removed Jaja of Opobo for his opposition to direct British trade in the Imo river valley. The rulers of Nembe (Brass), lying on the main Nun estuary of the Niger, were involved in quarrels between exploring and trading British expeditions and local peoples from the 1830s when British citizens got killed or shot at. The final showdown came in 1895, when the Nembe attacked the major depot of the Royal Niger Company at the port of Akassa and destroyed it. This was in protest against the Company's attempt to establish monopoly trade all the way up from Akassa in the delta to Lokoja at the Niger-Benue confluence.

But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British, Boers and Africans in South Africa, 1850-80', 'section_title': 'British expansion in South Africa 1870-80', 'content': ""The peace settlement came in the form of the Pretoria Convention, signed in August 1881. In the settlement, even though the British failed in their supreme objective of federating the Transvaal with the other colonies and the Orange Free State, they gained control of African labour in that a resident would be stationed in Pretoria to supervise Boer African administration. Secondly, overall British imperial supremacy in the Trans¬ vaal was guaranteed through British control of the republic's external relations as well as the British right to station and move military forces and equipment freely about in the Transvaal in time ofwar. The Boers obtained self-government, which indeed proved to be a stepping stone to greater freedom. Further negotiations produced the London Convention of 27 February 1884 under which Britain relinquished its control over the Africans, but retained control of the republic's foreign relations.51\nJust as the imperial forces were struggling to crush the Boer uprising, the Cape colonial forces were fighting the Sotho in a war that broke out on 13 September 1880. Just like the first Anglo-Boer War, the Lesotho armed conflict was intimately related to the British efforts to achieve a South African confederation. Both the Cape colonial government and the British officials at the Cape wanted to disarm the African states as a first step to federation. And it was the Sotho rejection of unilateral disarmament that led to the Cape-Sotho War of 1880-1.\nSince 1872 Lesotho had come under the Cape colonial administration. Indeed as part of the efforts to bring South Africa into a union, Gordon Sprigg, the Cape Prime Minister who had replaced Molteno, had colluded with Frere to have the Peace Preservation Bill passed by the Cape Par› liament in 1878. The legislation empowered the government to order the Africans in the Cape Colony to surrender their guns in return for compensation. The law was initially not to apply to Lesotho; but Sprigg, who was aware of the large quantities of guns in Sotho hands, decided to extend it to that kingdom."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The structure of Volume VII', 'content': 'A great majority of African rulers, then, did opt for the defence of their sovereignty and independence.

We are opposed to the use of this term collaboration not only because it is inaccurate but also because it is derogatory and Eurocentric. As we have seen above, the fundamental issue at stake between the 1880s and the 1900s as far as the African rulers were concerned, was that of sove› reignty, and on this, it was quite clear that nobody was prepared to compromise. Those African rulers who have been mistakenly termed collaborators were those who thought that the best way of safeguarding their sovereignty or even regaining the sovereignty that they might have lost to some African power previous to the arrival of the Europeans was not to collaborate but rather to ally with the European invaders. A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation. But as we have seen, the Africans were all faced with the question of surrendering, retaining or regaining their sovereignty.

In a statement frequently referred to as most descriptive of the methods which the French actually pursued in this region between the wars, the Governor-General of French West Africa, Joost Van Vollenhoven, remarked in 1917: The chiefs 'have no power of their own, for there are not two authorities in the cercle ... ; there is only one! Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization. The egregious exception, however, was South Africa where the concept of'native authority' was the means by which the white minority assured local administration of Africans now displaced by the policy of segregation to territorial reserves."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

This was the period of the Napoleonic wars, the 'intellectual' revolutions, the German and Italian wars of unification, the Polish and Hungarian uprisings and the imperial rivalries culminating in the First World War. In Africa, while it should be admitted that the first two or three decades of the colonial era, that is from 1880 to the 1910s even intensified this state of instability, violence and disorder and, as Caldwell has shown, caused wholesale and unpardonable destruction and loss of population - the population of Belgian Congo was reduced by half during the first forty years of colonial rule, the Herero by four-fifths, the Namo by half and that of Libya by 750 ooo$^{11}$ - not even the anticolonial and Marxist schools would deny the fact that after the colonial occupation and the establishment of various administrative machineries, such wars of expansion and liberation came to an end, and most parts of Africa especially from the end of the First World War onwards enjoyed a great degree of continuous peace and security.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858.

The competition for power in Africa had been drawn into the international politics of the Concert of Europe where African diplomatic skills were at a grave disadvantage. It is doubtful whether African leaders realized until too late how great was the danger that threatened them. They were used to thinking that the European base was far away and that, in the final analysis, they had the advantage of numbers.\nThey continued to act as if they could play off one European power against another. In South Africa, they even believed that they could appeal to the Queen of England and her direct representatives to carry out treaty obligations against the wishes of Anglo-Boer settlers and fortune seekers. Far from any notion of forging a pan-African solidarity similar to that pursued by the Europeans, each African state acted as seemed best in its own individual interest.\nIt appears that, if any factor is to be singled out, the basic explanation for this was to be found not only in the diplomatic abilities of the European strategists, but also in the legacy of wars that was part of the revolutionary situation of nineteenth-century Africa.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

The professed European desire to keep Africa as militarily neutralized as possible was in fact never realized. The French introduced a law of conscription in 1919 whereby an African contingent of 10000 was to be annually obtained; the British developed a Sudan Defence Force, uniquely staffed by Sudanese as well as by British officers, but primarily directed to imperial strategic needs in the Near East as well as in East Africa. The Force Publique of the Belgian Congo, exhibiting the qualities both of occupation army and police force, was frequently used during this era to quell resistance expressed in the form of syncretistic religious movements.$^{29}$ On the scale of open warfare, events can be easily measured.

There is little doubt that colonial bureaucratiza› tion did provide partial preparation for an unintended movement towards national independence. The configurations of a new political elite were slowly emerging, as lower-echelon clerks and appointed chiefs in various colonial services - but particularly the British - were learning to apply, if only modestly, Napoleon's imperative: 'careers open to talent'.

It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume.

Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty.

In our long-continued efforts with Her Majesty's Government, whose intervention was evidently essential, we never ceased to contend, that all that was needed to bring about such a pacification was, that Her Majesty's Government should give evidence of an earnest desire to bring about such a result. This earnest desire was at last shown by the dispatch of Commodore Commerell with his squadron into Bonny Waters, as a negotiator between the contending parties; the result has justified our convictions, and we can only regret that the intervention was so long delayed. What has been effected now might have been effected two or three years since, with greater advantages to the native disputants, and with an avoidance of the immense loss of British capital which has been caused by the long-continued dispute. There was at least a strong moral obligation on the British Government, in view of the Treaties which had been signed by the King and Chiefs of Bonny in former years, to interfere on behalf of King Peppel and the Chiefs of Bonny; and nothing but disaster has attended the non-fulfilment of this obligation; thus affording another instance of the national disadvantage which must always attend a protracted procrastination in the discharge of national duties. The Treaty, though not all that we could have desired for the King and Chiefs of Bonny, will at least bring back to them and to their river a portion of the trade of which they have been so long forcibly deprived; nor are we without hope that a rigid adherence to the Treaty on their part, with other wise measures which we confidently look for\n107\n\nfrom them, will gradually bring to them more than their former prosperity. The trade of those countries is capable of a much greater development than it has hitherto received. It may be regarded as still in its infancy, having only commenced some thirty-five years ago.

Several councils have been held, and amongst the complaints of the Greboes was the land question. They claim that Cape Palmas, where the Liberians are residing, is theirs, and they desire to have it. The deed of sale* was read to them on August 10, at a council held at the Methodist Episcopal Seminary, showing that their sires had sold the land to a Doctor Hall, of the United States of America, who was then Agent for the Colonization Society, since about the year 1834. This exasperated the natives. They went over to their towns across Hoffman River, held a war council, declared war against the Liberians, and have fired several shots on them from their towns. The Liberians do not wish to fight, but to reason with them; but the natives have refused all reasoning. The Hon. W. F. Nelson offered the natives eight hogsheads of tobacco, besides rum, crockeries, cloths, &c., to prevent them from proceeding to hostilities. R. S.

This war has been contemplated by the Greboes many years ago, but they, having been at war with each other, were divided.\n\nreason with them; but they refuse all entreaties, and declare that nothing will suffice them but the yielding up of Cape Palmas to them by the Liberians. The Liberians have fortified every place in Cape Palmas, have mounted their cannon, and have prepared their shells, rockets, hand-grenades, and other warlike instruments. On the very next fire from the enemy the battle will commence. The handful of educated native Grebo young men who have been educated by the American Episcopal Mission have been the prime movers of this war.\n\nThe steamship Yoruba, which was wrecked at Cape Palmas in June, 1873, and was bought by the Hon. W. F. Nelson, was floated in June last, when unfortunately the hawsers parted, and she went back on the beach. Mr. Nelson is a most energetic and persevering gentleman. A few weeks ago the mail steamer brought out two engineers, and he has since had new hawsers and anchors out. The expense of getting the Yoruba off has already cost Mr. Nelson over 30,000 dols.

At that time the trade with Lagos appeared to have diminished to a considerable extent. The imports in 1877 were of the value of £615,000, whereas they had fallen in 1890 to £500,000. The exports in 1877 were £734,000; they had diminished in 1890 to £595,000. When they considered that the area of the Colony was over 1,000 square miles, with a large population, they could understand that with through trade routes with other tribes there was an opening for the commerce of Lagos to an enormous extent. The town of Lagos itself had a population of 32,000. It was the largest town on the West African coast, and possessed the only safe harbour for 1,000 miles along the coast. In the interior there were other large towns, one of which had a population of 150,000, and its importance to British trade could not be overestimated.

For years these have been at war with each other, with the results that trade has been very much interfered with and the country impoverished. Colonel Niven, Administrator-in-Chief, attended by request of the parties to witness the signing of the treaty of peace between Lahai Bundoo and Gbannah Lehrey, two powerful chiefs, who had been at war with each other for a long time past. Various Consuls were present, and a guard of honour of 200 men of the 1st West India Regiment also attended. The treaties stipulated that the various parties would act peaceably towards each other, and that in the event of any disputes arising the matters should be referred to the British Governor at Sierra Leone, whose decision would be final. There were some 300 chiefs, present with their headmen, &c., and it is expected that the meeting will put an end to the numerous quarrels and conflicts which have occurred in this district. After the proceedings a number of English and other traders addressed a letter to Colonel Niven, requesting him to allow Day Mauro, King of Bullom, and Allimany Sawassi, Chief Medina, to go up to Fort Hokkoh to settle a war then going on between two powerful chiefs and their followers.

At last the efforts made have been crowned with success. The contending factions were grouped into two opposing sides. On the one side were the Ibadans, a powerful tribe situated right in the centre of the region of the war, and, therefore, surrounded by enemies; and on the other was a confederation of tribes under the general name of the Ekitiparapos. Man-catching was the real object of the war, and herein lay the great difficulty in the way of mediation; for it was obvious that none of the man-catching tribes would surrender their main source of revenue without a struggle. However, with the aid of two educated natives, a treaty of peace was signed in July, 1886, and ratified in the following September.\n\nThe first circumstance which opened up a prospect of successful mediation was an intimation received by Administrator Moloney, at Lagos, of a quarrel between the King of the Sebus and his people, the former wanting to continue the war and the latter to end it. It was not till long afterwards that Sir Samuel Rowe felt he was justified in interfering. His first attempt was not encouraging, but ultimately the Kings of the Ekitiparapos confederacy, twenty-six in number, appealed to the Governor, stating their grievances against the Ibadans, and asking him to prevent their being supplied with ammunition from Lagos through the agency of an Ibadan there.\n\nThe answer came from Mr. Moloney, who had assumed the government of the colony, and he addressed it to all the belligerents, rating them soundly for continuing the war, and offering his services as mediator. The replies were favourable. An armistice was arranged, and conferences were held. Statements setting forth the case for each tribe separately were forwarded to the Governor. In one of them (from the commander of the Jebus) the following passage occurs: ""Ile Ife is regarded by all our nation as the sacred spot from which we originated, and the Oni is respected as the father of all the Kings. This is why the Jebu King felt it his duty to reinstate the Ifes in the town. It was from Ile Ife that his father went to settle in the Jebu country. His father did not die, but he was converted into a rock, which could still be seen. Even the English King can be shown the spot at Ile Ife from whence his ancestors went out.

The public meetings held, the lectures and addresses delivered, have amounted to upwards of 350, besides a large number of special sermons on peace delivered by various ministers, at the suggestion of the Committee. The Press has been utilized in various ways. Publications of all sorts, from the octavo volume to the two-paged tract have been issued in a steady stream. The system of supplying newspapers and periodicals with paragraphs bearing on peace and war has, through the kindness of editors, been carried out with great effect. The Ladies' Auxiliary Branch and the Workmen's Peace Association have also been in active operation. A new method of interesting the young in the subject has been adopted by offering prizes to young persons in schools for the best essays on topics connected with the question. The report congratulates the friends of peace on the conclusion of the Afghan war. After spending twenty millions of money in scattering havoc and devastation through that land, we have had to retreat within our own borders, our present rulers having had the courage to withdraw from a position as perilous as it was unjust. The report relates the steps taken by the Committee in reference to the Transvaal question, their deputation to Lord Kimberley, the meetings held in various parts of the country, the memorials presented to the Prime Minister; and they refer to the manner in which the Government, to its infinite honour, persevered in its peace negotiations, even in the face of reverse and defeat. It warns the country against being misled by the wild and alarming reports sent home by a certain class of African colonists who detest the peace, and are bent upon rekindling a war which would subserve their interests at the expense of the mother country, which will have to bear the cost. The report next speaks of M. Richard's motion in the House of Commons, in June last, in favour of a mutual reduction of armaments, which, after eliciting an interesting discussion and an admirable speech from Mr. Gladstone, was carried, not in the original form proposed but in an amended form suggested by Mr. Bright. It refers also to the other Parliamentary resolution, submitted by Mr. Richard last month, on the conduct of British representatives abroad, in contracting engagements and making war without authority from the central Government, which also called forth a most valuable speech from the Prime Minister, and was lost on a division by a majority of only eight in a House of 137. The report dwells with satisfaction on the general interest which the discussion had excited in the Press, as evidenced by the serious and, for the most part, favourable comments of most of the London and provincial papers. It, however, condemns and deplores the continuance of the Basuto war. Finally, it alludes with satisfaction to the frequency of the cases which now occur of states settling their disputes by arbitration, or some form of peaceable reference, instead of an appeal to the sword. Three such instances have taken place during the past year. A difference between France and the Republic of Nicaragua was, by the wish of the latter, referred to the arbitration of the French Court of Cassation. The states of Chili and Columbia have signed a convention, submitting a dangerous dispute between them to the President of the United States. And still more important is the convention between the United States of America and the French Republic, referring a variety of contending claims existing between the two Governments to three commissioners, one to be nominated by the President of the United States, one by the French Government, and the third by the Emperor of Brazil, all which, it is contended, are significant indications that civilized Governments are gradually awaking to a sense of the reasonableness of adjusting their differences by other means than the brutal arbitrament of war."", 'last_edit_date': '1881-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1881#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'GREAT BRITAIN AND FRANCE IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Colonial policy of Great Britain and France in West Africa has been widely different.

This object she has attained by a large and constant expenditure, and by a succession of military expeditions. She has overcome by arms the Almamy Ahmadoo, who ruled to the north of the river, and has connected his territories with the coast by a chain of military posts. She is now at war with the Almamy Samadu, or Samory, who lays claim to vast regions in the interior on the southern affluents of the river, extended southward to the frontiers of Liberia, eastward to the territory of his enemy Tieba, and westward to the confines of the Rivières du Sud and Sierra Leone. Great Britain, on the other hand, has adopted the policy of advance by commercial enterprise. She has not attempted to compete with the military operations of her neighbour. The punitive expedition to Ashanti of 1873, necessary for the protection of the Gold Coast Colony, has been the sole exception to this pacific policy. Nevertheless, as the upshot of it, the British Government have made substantial progress. While guarding the stability of the old colonies, they have added to them the whole territory of the Oil Rivers, where by breaking down the restrictive system of the native middlemen, they have given an important impulse to trade, which is evidenced by the growing interest of the Chambers of Commerce; and the spirit and energy of the Royal Niger Company have, without the expenditure of Imperial funds, or the sacrifice of the life of a single British soldier, placed under the protection of the Crown, the whole of the Lower, a great portion of the Central, Niger, and its affluent, the Benue, up to Yola.

But the case is different in the neighbourhood of Sierra Leone. There the people are divided into a number of very small tribes, and though their wars are sufficient to fill their country with bloodshed and frequently to stop trade, they have never shown inclination or capacity to form anything like a nation.

The members of the deputation seem to have been imperfectly acquainted with the later developments of French activity in the regions under discussion, and not to have realized the force of the successive treaties by which the political spheres of the two countries have been gradually enclosed within geographical limits. Yet the negotiations between the two Governments which led up to the treaty of last year have been from time to time made public in all essential points. That treaty was intended to form the last link of a chain of agreements which should simplify the relations of the two Powers in that part of Africa, and it is now too late to urge the extension of our political influence into a sphere which has been assigned to France. It is impossible, in territories where the frontier is still vague, for one civilised Government to refuse to acknowledge treaties submitted to it by another on the ground that native signatories of the treaty desire to repudiate it.

A desperate war is ravaging the richest region of South America. The South Seas are perturbed with anxieties and desires concerning New Guinea and the New Hebrides. Asia has its Tonquin question in the south, and throngs of other questions in the west and north. Europe is overridden with armies and with difficulties, civil, religious, and international. But any who love to fish in troubled waters may be recommended to turn their thoughts to Africa in preference to all. Africa riots in questions of every sorts and to suit every taste. Spain has its eyes upon new possessions in Morocco. France, besides its latest preoccupation with Madagascar, remains busy with Tunis, and has not made up its mind about Tripoli. A British army holds half of Egypt, and a religious war engages the rest. Abyssinia is so habituated to anarchy that itself and its neighbours are scarcely conscious of agitations which are as violent as ever. On the West Coast every few months the British public hears that it has been warring with negro tribes and desolating their homes in the interests of civilization and commerce. A new element of curiosity and excitement may at any moment be now anticipated from the contiguity of Mr. Stanley and M. de Brazza. Mr. Stanley, it is announced, has been instructed by the Association which commissions him to be as friendly towards M. de Brazza as is compatible with the defence of its territory against trespassers and a protest against annexation. Mr. Stanley\'s acquaintances will know how he is likely to interpret those liberal instructions. It will be surprising if an iron will like his and a fiery ambition like M. de Brazza\'s find the Congo or an entire continent sufficiently spacious to contain both. In North Africa and in the central west various white races share the duty of preserving the country from stagnating in peace. In the south the European ingredient is less multifarious. It is not at all less proficient in the art of setting itself and its native neighbours by the ears. The Cape Government enjoys a profuse choice of subjects for solicitude and controversy. Basutoland has not ceased to be a care because the colony has determined to wash its hands of the glory and cost of its custody. All its chiefs are proposing to fight, and they are too close to the colonial borders for Cape colonists to look on with composure at the conflict. The Pondos are as restless as the Basutos, with the additional vexation that when they are not fighting one another they are lifting the cattle of white farmers across the frontier. In the interior a multitude of critics are inclined to scrutinize suspiciously the new policy towards the Basutos. The Transvaal has its hands still full of contentions with Caffres within and without. It wants British money, and it wants to curtail the little British influence the Convention allowed. On the southeast coast, Natal, according to its custom, is equally uneasy and unable to decide on the precise form the remedy for its grievances should take. Hardly a section of African soil, north and south, and east and west, is without its vexations and feuds, in which Europe is obliged to interest itself, and of which the telegraph is compelled to attempt to chronicle the shadowy stages. A predominant sentiment of Englishmen at home, as they read these fragments of obscure African news, must be a desire either to know more or nothing, to be able to intervene with effect or not at all. On the Congo it is pleasant to feel that Mr. Stanley may be left to himself. He is not an English subject; and his enterprise, however sincere the sympathy of Englishmen with its objects, is not an English enterprise. Yet even on the Congo England has considerable mercantile interests at stake, and owns corresponding rights which it cannot surrender or suffer to be trampled on. Higher up, on the Gold Coast, its powers are larger, and it exerts them more amply. There would be a satisfaction in knowing the principles on which the periodical shelling of negro villages for offences against English trade proceeds, and whether the Colonial Office have a policy in relation to such matters, and what it is. On the Gold Coast there is nobody to interfere with England, and English supremacy, it may be suspected, is used at times somewhat too vigorously. In Egypt it might be wished on behalf of Egypt itself that it were used more masterfully than at present. Europe regards England as responsible for the health of Egypt; and England hesitates to assume the prerogatives which that responsibility implies. South African embarrassments permit an easier remedy, with a diminution instead of an increase of the burdens of empire. England often finds imperial responsibilities heavy without being free to abdicate them.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1883#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICA AT THE MEETING OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the meeting of the British Association, held this year at Newcastle-on-Tyne, the things of Africa came in for a good deal of discussion and consideration.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

As we have seen above, the fundamental issue at stake between the 1880s and the 1900s as far as the African rulers were concerned, was that of sove› reignty, and on this, it was quite clear that nobody was prepared to compromise. Those African rulers who have been mistakenly termed collaborators were those who thought that the best way of safeguarding their sovereignty or even regaining the sovereignty that they might have lost to some African power previous to the arrival of the Europeans was not to collaborate but rather to ally with the European invaders. A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation. But as we have seen, the Africans were all faced with the question of surrendering, retaining or regaining their sovereignty.

When he ascended the throne in 1894, he seemed to be suspicious of Europeans, mostly missionaries at that time, so he sought to restrict his people's interactions with them. Those among the Baganda who had embraced the Christian faith and who would not obey his orders were put to death as traitors.$^{29}$ Today, Christians regard them as martyrs. Mwanga was, however, violently resisting attempts by British agents to take over his country even though disguised as mission› aries. But his diplomatic ability also became apparent in the way he handled various, often warring religious sects. At one time, he would play the two Christian sects, Catholics and Protestants, against Muslims when he thought the latter were becoming too powerful and therefore threatening his control of the country. At another time, he would ally with Muslims against Catholics or Protestants or both depending on who he thought was dangerous to his rule. Thus, Mwanga was adept at the diplomatic game of divide and rule, a tactic which the colonizing powers were able to use so effectively in controlling Africa. When it was necessary, Mwanga resorted to a revival of some old tradition in an attempt to drive out all foreigners as happened in 1888.$^{30}$ On this occasion, he intended to entice all foreigners and their Baganda followers to a naval parade on an island on Lake Victoria. There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains.

It makes sense, as Boahen has suggested, to see the events of the time and their key actors in terms of diplomacy, pursued independently or backed by force. To appreciate the extent to which diplomacy could go, it is necessary to understand the socio-economic forces operating in a particular society at the time of the encounter. For East Africa, a survey of such factors in the 1890s will be an appropriate setting for the events that followed. But, as R. I. Rotberg and Ali Mazrui state: 'There is no gainsaying that the introduction of Western norms and power and accompanying controls was everywhere in Africa questioned by the people affected'. 2 This questioning, however, took various forms.

In such societies, response to foreign penetration tended to be dictated by the king or the leadership as a whole. What had existed in Europe at one time - 'The religion of the king is my religion' - sums up the attitude well. Other societies, such as the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika or the Nandi in Kenya were in the process of forming centralized governments. This process is often referred to as state formation.

If they were less farsighted, less fortunate or less well-advised, they would see their traditional enemies siding with the invader and would themselves assume an attitude of resistance, which could all too easily end in military defeat, the deposition of chiefs, the loss of land to the native allies of the occupying power, possibly even to the political fragmen› tation of the society or state ...

In consequence no 'gifts', the crucial symbol of international relations, passed in either direction.\nMore successful was the mixture of diplomacy and force that resulted in truces (for example with Kebbi: the Lafiyar Togo 1866-74)$^{ or}$ treaties with smaller neighbouring communities to which the caliphate offered protection (amana) in return for a tax. In some areas the tax, assessed collectively, stipulated captives as well as goods such as mats, and so was similar to the contributions of some emirates.

African leaders had no answer to this strategy. The competition for power in Africa had been drawn into the international politics of the Concert of Europe where African diplomatic skills were at a grave disadvantage. It is doubtful whether African leaders realized until too late how great was the danger that threatened them. They were used to thinking that the European base was far away and that, in the final analysis, they had the advantage of numbers.\nThey continued to act as if they could play off one European power against another. In South Africa, they even believed that they could appeal to the Queen of England and her direct representatives to carry out treaty obligations against the wishes of Anglo-Boer settlers and fortune seekers. Far from any notion of forging a pan-African solidarity similar to that pursued by the Europeans, each African state acted as seemed best in its own individual interest.\nIt appears that, if any factor is to be singled out, the basic explanation for this was to be found not only in the diplomatic abilities of the European strategists, but also in the legacy of wars that was part of the revolutionary situation of nineteenth-century Africa. It was the intensity of the rivalries and the bitterness of the wars that made African rulers slow to realize that tackling the European threat should have taken precedence over their inter› state rivalries, and that they should have united to face it.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Models of African initiatives and reactions', 'content': ""War-weariness and insecurity contributed greatly to the acceptance of British wardship or alliance on the part of several African polities and individuals.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Central Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'The struggle to maintain independence: the era of confrontation and alliance', 'content': 'of the most powerful states, ethnic particularism, and internal cleavages among the ruling strata or class and occasionally, between it and their subject population.

This is a question that has so far not been seriously considered by historians, African or European, but it needs to be answered. The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy. Asante must remain as of old at the same time to remain friendly with all white men. I do not write this in a boastful spirit but in the clear sense of its meaning ... the cause of Asante is progressing and there is no reason for any Asante man to feel alarm at the prospects or to believe for a single instant that our cause has been driven back by the events of the past hostilities. 2\nIn 1895, Wobogo, the Moro Naba, or King of the Mossi (in modern Upper Volta), told the French officer, Captain Destenave: I know that the whites wish to kill me in order to take my country, and yet you claim that they will help me to organize my country. But I find my country good just as it is. I have no need of them. I know what is necessary for me and what I want: I have my own merchants: also, consider yourself fortunate that I do not order your head to be cut off.

John Thornton has con› trasted the resistance potential of states and of stateless societies much to the advantage of the latter: States are often praised for their role in resistance to the European invasion ... actually ... their role was ambiguous. Some, it is true, resisted fairly well ... But many other state societies collapsed on impact with the Europeans ...

In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

Most of the discussion, if not all of it, has been centred on the dichotomy between resisters, who by implication are to be praised as heroes, and so-called collaborators, who also by implication are to be condemned as traitors. This classification came about as a result of the nationalist struggle for independence in Africa, as elsewhere in the world. Those involved in the movement tended to see themselves as heirs to a long tradition of struggle whose roots go back to the beginning of this century, if not earlier. It was assumed that independence was a good thing and to strive for it was natural. Consequently, all those who had resisted European penetration of Africa, in order to preserve its inde› pendence, were heroes to be emulated and given an honourable place in the histories of the countries that had gained their independence through resistance to colonial rule. Put in these terms, this view is an attempt to use the standards of the present, with the aid of hindsight, to interpret the events of the past. In the colonial situation, those who resisted were described by colonial officials as short-sighted while those who collaborated were seen as far-sighted. Today, nationalist historians in East Africa con› demn so-called collaborators, especially chiefs, and praise resisters. 1\nAmong the resisters, there were also divisions. There were those who took to armed confrontation with the intruders - active resistance. Then there were those who, though they did not take to arms, refused to co› operate with the intruders.

It was altogether a splendid sight, and very interesting, even to those who were not entire strangers to such scenes. The immense crowd of spectators, all of whom were dressed in their holiday attire, added greatly to the effect. The number of young men and women dressed in European style astonished even the old residents. There was a very large sprinkling of young females expensively got up in native attire. Although there were three or four professors of the art of photography on the spot, yet it is a pity that not one of them availed himself of such a favourable occasion to take a group of African fair ones, so that their likenesses might have been enclosed herewith, in order that you kind people in England might see how shamefully some of your would-be artists misrepresent African females in features, dress, and everything else. After the termination of this African review, which passed off without the slightest accident, and at which the Governor expressed himself highly pleased, his Excellency and suite returned to the fort. In the evening a sumptuous banquet was given to his Excellency in the grand hall of the fort, by the Commandant and the principal residents of Anamaboe. Covers were laid for fifty guests. The King and three of his principal chiefs were invited, as also several gentlemen from Cape Coast and Anamaboe. The officers of the Anamaboe Volunteer Rifles were also present in full uniform. The viands and wines were of the most _recherché_ description. After the usual loyal toasts, the health of his Excellency was proposed and responded to with that hearty goodwill which testifies to the respect that the Africans of the Gold Coast still entertain towards the representative of Her Majesty the Queen of England, in spite of the severe shocks which they have experienced on perceiving that their confidence in, and respect for, some of their late rulers were so woefully misplaced. A native band enlivened the festivity by performing some popular native airs on native instruments, late in the evening—the first time, I believe, that the services of a _bona fide_ native band had ever been called into requisition on such an occasion. On the 4th, at noon, his Excellency proceeded in an open carriage to the Fort-gate, whence a procession set out for the site appointed for the erection of the new market, in the following order: A carriage containing his Excellency and suite; a detachment of the Gold Coast Artillery; a detachment of the Anamaboe Volunteer Rifles; merchants and other residents of Anamaboe; the members of the Anamaboe Temperance Society, under their president and founder, R. J. Ghartey; the boys and girls of the Wesleyan Mission School, preceded by the Rev. Timothy Laing, native minister. On arriving at the site, his Excellency was met by the King and chiefs with their staff, who had formed a most brilliant procession from another quarter of the town. A silver trowel was presented to his Excellency by Commandant Thomson, and after the usual observances, not forgetting the new coins, his Excellency proceeded to lay the foundation-stone; which done, he delivered a brief but most appropriate speech. The school-children then sang ""God save the Queen,"" and their performance so delighted the Governor, that he caused them to repeat the anthem, at the conclusion of which three cheers were given, and the procession returned in the same order that it had arrived. The weather was most propitious during the whole of the time. During the day many chiefs from different parts of the country in the commandantship of Anamaboe came into town with their retainers and fired salutes and reviewed their men, in honour of the Governor. The proceedings of this day were brought to a fitting conclusion by a _grand \'relish,\'_ or, as you would term it, a _déjeuner à la fourchette,_ in the fort, and the performance of the numerous guests on the occasion bore ample testimony to the fact that they did not come there for mere pastime. His Excellency and suite returned to Cape Coast Castle early on the ensuing morning. With the exception of the Governor, Major Cochrane, Lieutenant Thomson, and Mr. Brown, of Cape Coast, all those who assisted in the ceremonies of these two days were natives of Africa, including some hundreds of educated men.

By the long residence of Dr. Nachtigall in Northern Africa, and his knowledge of the language and customs of the country, he was especially adapted for this work.

The prospect of being obliged to remain a year in Murzuk before being enabled to find a caravan going southwards, induced Nachtigall to pay a visit to the south-eastern countries, Tuor and Tibesti, in spite of the unfavourable reputation of the natives for pilfering, treachery, and other abominable qualities, to all of which Nachtigall from his own experience can testify. The impression produced by this dreadful journey will never be effaced from his memory. After Nachtigall and his servants had, for want of water, looked death in the face and barely escaped with their lives by secret flight, under protection of darkness, they succeeded, after a two months’ march, in arriving, in a wretched state of filth, destitution, and starvation, at Tadjjeri, and on the 8th of October, entirely worn out, with swollen feet, and indescribably weak, at Murzuk.

The head-man of Monyanga and his son were fine, friendly men; gave us two houses, took the whole care of providing and cooking food for us, and sent a man to show us the brook to wash. We were now really in the country interior to Rumby, rather more than half a day\'s walk from Balundu, which is the principal trading place of Yellow Duke of Calabar, and where that celebrated man was at the time. We were only two or three hours\' walk from Ekumbi, the place we had been trying to reach, and on the direct road for the interior.\n\nWe were to the north of the mountain. On looking behind we saw it to the south of us. We were astonished to see that the posts of a new house that was being erected were well charred to about four inches above the ground. We asked why they did that, when they replied, ""To make the posts last long; that when charred they would not cut."" I had never seen this done by natives before, except in imitation of white men. Another peculiar thing we noticed was that a country rope was used to mark the line of the posts. The people said these things were their own customs, and they had not been taught by any one. My letter is too long already, so I must jump to the conclusion. At night the head-man and his son arranged that we should leave carriers and boxes with them, and, taking one box only, we should go, with a man they would give us, into Ekumbi, and as the place was large, there being three head-men, we should stay one night, and return the day after. The next morning we had to wait for breakfast, which was cooked for us by our host. When that was over, a private conference of a number of head-men from other places was held.'}, {'id': 3973, 'article_title': 'West Coast of Africa', 'full_section_title': 'West Coast of Africa', 'last_edit_date': '04-17-1880', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1880#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_06_1880', 'content': ""The African steam-ship Company's steamer Nubia, which has arrived in the Mersey, brings news of the crowning by Acting Consul Easton of the successor to the late King Archibong III., of Old Calabar.

The party consisted of the Acting Governor Captain Mulliner, Commodore Wilmot, Dr. Eales, and Mr. Collins, secretary to the Commodore. They were allowed to pass, and reached Abeokuta on the 10th May.\n\nTheir efforts to restore a good understanding have been tolerably well received, as far as words go, but that is all. The interruption to trade continues. But we have now a new Acting Governor, and since his landing there has been a revival of confidence that some adjustment of those difficulties with Abeokuta that interfere with trade, and some pacification of the interior, will be effected. Captain Glover, Acting Governor of Lagos, lost no time in notifying to the Abeokutans in a friendly way his arrival here, and we learn that his letter has made a really good impression. He is now at Ikorodu, and seems really to be setting about his work in a business-like way. Everybody feels glad that Captain Glover has been sent out to us. We think that, if any man could consolidate what good might have been done, rectify errors, and undo evil quietly, Captain Glover is the man for it. Nothing could have been better than his sending up to Abeokuta directly he came, and letting them know he was Acting Governor here. You are aware that the foolish neglect to do this of Governor Freeman had a great deal to do with all the difficulties there have since been between him and Abeokuta. By that, he made it impossible for himself ever to have really friendly relations with people so jealous and tenacious about etiquette as the Egbas are.

While French and German expeditions were being organised on either side, the Niger Company last winter despatched an embassy to the Sultan of Bornou to find out by personal negotiations what attitude he is prepared to assume towards the entire wave of European influence which is approaching his empire from the west. The expedition, about 300 strong, was under the command of the Company\'s officer, Mr. Charles Macintosh, who had with him a staff of two or three other Europeans; a part of his convoy consisted of the Houssa troops of the Company, and the remainder was made up of porters bearing food and equipment for the party, together with a liberal supply of presents for the monarch whom it was hoped to propitiate. The whole party were fully armed, but their instructions were to regard themselves as a strictly peaceful mission, and to take every precaution to avoid bloodshed. As the country between the Benue and Lake Tchad was unknown, food was taken for the whole journey. A draft treaty between the Niger Company and the Sultan of Bornou was confided to the diplomatic care of Mr. Macintosh to negotiate if possible. The party left Ribago, on the Benue, in October, and struck in a due northerly direction for Kouka. The distance as the crow flies is something less than 250 miles, not so far as from London to Durham. It was traversed at the rate of ten or twelve miles a day, and after three weeks\' travelling, the expedition arrived at the Court of Bornou. Scientific observations of the country were taken on the way. The natives, from whom nothing was requested, were not otherwise than friendly. At Kouka, which is a considerable town, with a population of about 120,000, and regarded as the western terminus of Mohammedan civilisation in Central Africa, the arrival of Europeans created no small sensation. The Embassy was well received by the Sultan, who assigned it quarters in the town, and was pleased to accept as a preliminary to negotiations some portion of the presents which were offered to him. Two months of Oriental dilly-dally followed, during which time the officers of the Company made use of their opportunity to acquire political and commercial information relating to Bornou and its sister States. Arabs from all quarters thronged about them, and the Houssa language, which is the _lingua franca_ of the Central States, served as a medium of communication. Political factions abound at the Court of Kouka as elsewhere; but the result left in the minds of Mr. Macintosh and his companions after prolonged discussion with the various leaders is that all factions unite in a determination to repel the approach of Western civilisation. Bornou draws all its knowledge of the outer world from the reports of pilgrims and caravans travelling to Mecca and other centres of the East. The Mahdist disturbances in the Soudan, which have forced pilgrims to Mecca, to pass by way of Cairo, have had the effect, as regards Bornou, of keeping it better informed than it was before of the progress of the world\'s affairs, and have contributed to weld it and the neighbouring States more closely to the Eastern and Mohammedan as opposed to the Western and Christian system. The power and influence of Senousism in the Central States have not been, so far as the Niger Mission was able to ascertain, in any sense over-estimated by general report. Religious fanaticism supported by the sword is the prevailing spirit of government in Bornou. A well-established current of trade with the East and long-standing political traditions at present serve to combine all interests against European intrusion. It is neither England nor France nor Germany which is feared, but the European as European, the revolution of steam and enlightenment and liberty as against the camel and ignorance and despotism. The persistence of the European is well known, but while he presents himself in the peaceful guise of a trader only arms will suffice to drive him back. There is not a caravan which comes across the desert that does not bring evidence of the fact that, whether in Egypt, or Tripoli, or Turkey, the European, once admitted, reduces the Oriental to submission. The East has but one story. Bornou is of the East, and it stands in the position of a man who has never tasted wine and who sees his neighbour drunk. He realises all the consequences; he has never experienced the force of the circumstances which have produced them. The Sultan of Bornou and his advisers say in their pride, ""The evil has all come from having dealings with the West.

There was a hand-shaking and an interchange of civilities such as had not taken place between the parties for years. May the reconciliation and peace be permanent!\n\nI enclose a printed copy of the ""Agreement"" entered into between the Consul and the Duke Town authorities.\n\nIt is worthy of record that the Consul occupied the pulpit of Duke Town Church one Sabbath afternoon, and delivered (of course, through an interpreter) a very good, plain, practical discourse to a very crowded native audience.\n\nOne of the worst features of the Egbo Institution has all along been the licence given to the Egbo runners to flog and otherwise abuse any person whom they might fall in with who had not bought the privileges of the particular grade of the Institution represented by the runners in possession of the town. A strong effort was made to get that iniquitous abuse abolished. All, however, that the Consul could wring out of the authorities on this point was a verbal promise that henceforth due intimation shall be given to the whole town, by the ringing of the big Egbo bell to give warning that the runners will be out; and, further, that the runners themselves shall always give notice of their approach by sounding the bell attached to their persons. This is a step in the right direction, but it does not strike at the root of the evil. So far back as 1856, the Earl of Clarendon, then H.M.\'s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, instructed the then Consul (Hutchinson), in his dealings with the native chiefs, ""to insist strongly, in the name of H.M.\'s Government, on the discontinuance of the barbarous custom"" referred to.\n\nBoth traders and missionaries testified their approval of the procedure of the Consul by presenting to him written addresses after his more important public work was over. That of the missionaries is rather long perhaps, but I shall furnish you with a few extracts from it. That of the traders breathed the same spirit of cordial approval of what the Consul had accomplished.\n\nThe missionaries in their address write thus:—\n\n""It was with much satisfaction that we learned six or eight months ago of your appointment to the Consulate of the Bights of Biafra and Benin. You have not come among us as a stranger.

Now that the dispute with the Jebus and Egbas would seem to be in a fair way of settlement, it affords an opportunity to the Governor of Lagos to insure that, though these tribes are to be treated fairly and with patience, they must quite understand that any infraction of the engagements now or subsequently undertaken by them, will be visited most severely upon the offenders.\n\nBut the troubles in this part of the world are by no means confined to the British.

At last the efforts made have been crowned with success. The contending factions were grouped into two opposing sides. On the one side were the Ibadans, a powerful tribe situated right in the centre of the region of the war, and, therefore, surrounded by enemies; and on the other was a confederation of tribes under the general name of the Ekitiparapos. Man-catching was the real object of the war, and herein lay the great difficulty in the way of mediation; for it was obvious that none of the man-catching tribes would surrender their main source of revenue without a struggle. However, with the aid of two educated natives, a treaty of peace was signed in July, 1886, and ratified in the following September.\n\nThe first circumstance which opened up a prospect of successful mediation was an intimation received by Administrator Moloney, at Lagos, of a quarrel between the King of the Sebus and his people, the former wanting to continue the war and the latter to end it. It was not till long afterwards that Sir Samuel Rowe felt he was justified in interfering. His first attempt was not encouraging, but ultimately the Kings of the Ekitiparapos confederacy, twenty-six in number, appealed to the Governor, stating their grievances against the Ibadans, and asking him to prevent their being supplied with ammunition from Lagos through the agency of an Ibadan there.\n\nThe answer came from Mr. Moloney, who had assumed the government of the colony, and he addressed it to all the belligerents, rating them soundly for continuing the war, and offering his services as mediator. The replies were favourable. An armistice was arranged, and conferences were held. Statements setting forth the case for each tribe separately were forwarded to the Governor. In one of them (from the commander of the Jebus) the following passage occurs: ""Ile Ife is regarded by all our nation as the sacred spot from which we originated, and the Oni is respected as the father of all the Kings. This is why the Jebu King felt it his duty to reinstate the Ifes in the town. It was from Ile Ife that his father went to settle in the Jebu country. His father did not die, but he was converted into a rock, which could still be seen. Even the English King can be shown the spot at Ile Ife from whence his ancestors went out.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Central Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'The struggle to maintain independence: the era of confrontation and alliance', 'content': 'century occurred only after fifteen years of diplomatic manoeuvring with Great Britain.$^{14}$ In the most extreme cases, states like Quitanghona in northern Mozambique and the Chikunda empires of the Zambezi valley willingly acknowledged the nominal authority of the Portuguese so long as no serious effort was made to impose colonial rule.$^{IS}$ This strategy, however, invariably led to confrontation, since the Congress of Berlin explicitly demanded effective control as a pre-condition for international recognition of a claim to colonial possession.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.634, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Only few of the colonial administrators seemed to have understood how to manage the uneasy relationship which existed between the 'traditional' and the new African elites on the one hand, and between these two sets of elites and the colonial regimes on the other.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

This is a question that has so far not been seriously considered by historians, African or European, but it needs to be answered. The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy.

Twice he attempted to come to terms with Lugard, but the latter would not countenance these gestures. 2 7 Mwanga, the Kabaka of Buganda, at times tried to intercede on behalf of the Bunyoro king but to no avail. Eventually, Kabarega resorted to guerrilla warfare, probably the first of its kind in East Africa. He with› drew from Bunyoro to the Lango country in the north from where he harassed British forces time and again. One of the British officials occupying Bunyoro at the time, Thurston, commented: 'Kabarega was at his old tricks - giving every possible trouble but never standing up for a fair fight, preferring to pursue his favourite methods of assassination. Kabarega caused poison to be given to a friendly chief and he died, but I have had the poisoner killed.'$^{28}$ Thurston's description is a perfect example of the guerrilla tactic of withdrawing to a neighbouring country in order to harass occupying forces in one's own country.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence.

Thus, Mwanga was adept at the diplomatic game of divide and rule, a tactic which the colonizing powers were able to use so effectively in controlling Africa.

There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners.

Though Benin had signed a treaty of protection with the British in 1892, she none the less guarded her sovereignty with determination. This, of course, would not be tolerated in that age, and using the killing of the British acting consul-general and five other Englishmen on their way to Benin as an excuse, the British launched a punitive expedition of 1500 men against Benin in 1897. Though the Oba himself would have liked to submit, a majority of his chiefs raised an army to beat back the invasion. They were, however, defeated and the capital was looted of its precious bronze treasures and then burnt. 48 In the Niger Delta, as in many other areas of Nigeria, the British had signed treaties of protection with most of the chiefs by 1884. However, while some, like Calabar and Bonny, had allowed missionaries to operate in their states, others had not. Moreover, all of them were insisting on their sovereign rights to regulate trade and to levy duties on British traders. This, the new British consuls, such as Hewett and Johnston, would not tolerate. A typical example of the rulers who stood up to the British consuls and missionaries was Jaja of Opobo (see Plate 6.3). He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order. When Jaja still refused to comply in spite of Johnston's threats to bombard his town with British gunboats, Johnston enticed Jaja on board a ship in 1887 under a promise of safeconduct but arrested him and sent him to Accra$^{49}$ where he was tried and deported to the West Indies.

The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.637, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': ""Because the lands and peoples were so interwoven, developments in one part always had effects and implications in other parts. European abolitionists found, for example, that to stop the slave trade and the wars in the interior, they had to reckon not just with the coastal rulers but also with the different power bases in the interior. Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome. Similarly, British peace› makers involved in resolving aspects of nineteenth-century Yoruba warfare had to travel virtually throughout the length and breadth of the culture area.\nUnfortunately, the European approach was divisive, tending towards politically structured differentiation. This was already noticeable in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era. British interests came to be specifically protected visà-vis the interest of other European nationals; British interests were also advanced against those of Africans.

The inter-state wars did not weaken the resolve of each of the states to keep European traders from encroaching on their spheres of trade or in the maintenance of their sovereignty. The British had clashed with King William Pepple of Bonny as early as 1854, when they exiled him to Fernando Po, Ascension, Sierra Leone and London. They used disturbances caused by local feuds as an excuse. In 1887 they could find no such excuse when they removed Jaja of Opobo for his opposition to direct British trade in the Imo river valley. The rulers of Nembe (Brass), lying on the main Nun estuary of the Niger, were involved in quarrels between exploring and trading British expeditions and local peoples from the 1830s when British citizens got killed or shot at. The final showdown came in 1895, when the Nembe attacked the major depot of the Royal Niger Company at the port of Akassa and destroyed it. This was in protest against the Company's attempt to establish monopoly trade all the way up from Akassa in the delta to Lokoja at the Niger-Benue confluence.

Moshoeshoe beseeched the High Commissioner to be content with the loot of over 5000 cattle which the Governor's troops had managed to capture.

Moreover, many African rulers had been able to build empires of varying size only a couple of decades back, and some were still in the process of expanding or reviving their kingdoms. Many of them had been able to defend their sovereignties with the support of their people using traditional weapons and tactics. Some of them, like Samori Ture of the Mandinka empire in West Africa, and Menelik of Ethiopia, had even been able to modernize their armies. Because of this, the African rulers saw no reason why they could not maintain their sovereignty at that time. Furthermore, some thought they could stave off the invaders through diplomacy. As we shall see below, in 1889, while Cecil Rhodes was preparing to occupy the land of the Ndebele, their king, Lobengula, dispatched a delegation to London to see Queen Victoria; and while the British invading army was marching towards Kumasi in 1896 to seize Prempeh five years after he had turned down the British offer of protection, he dispatched a powerful diplomatic mission to Queen Victoria.

The guns were bought with wages earned at the diamond mines, and as such represented an enormous investment in labour. The Sotho also valued their guns because they might be used in future to defend their kingdom, as the long history of their struggle with the Orange Free State had only too clearly taught them. The possession of a gun by a man further signified the passage from childhood to adulthood among the Sotho. The Sotho also suspected that the Cape government did not fully trust them. Besides, the chiefs suspected that the Cape government wanted to weaken them so as to turn them into slaves. There were further measures that drove the Sotho into armed resistance. In 1879 the Cape Colony proposed to alienate the Qluthing district to white farmers as a punishment for its Sotho chief, Moorosi, who had recently rebelled. Such action was in complete violation of the British promises to Moshoeshoe that no part of his country would be alienated. Moreover, the Cape government also announced that the hut tax would be increased to £1. This was utterly unacceptable to the Sotho in view of the recent Cape move to appropriate £12000 from the Lesotho account to the Cape Colony.\nThe Sotho tried to come to an understanding with the Cape Colony by peaceful means.

We have for the last three months been anticipating what, to all intents and purposes, will prove a reality—viz., a war with the King of Ashantee. In November last, one of the captains of the King being ordered up to Comasie, on a charge of robbing what is regarded as the King's quota of gold, and being apprehensive that the issue would cost his head, escaped with eighty adherents from the kingdom of Ashantee to the coast, and claimed protection from the English Government. The King immediately sent one of his principal chieftains, with a number of sword-bearers, to request that the captain and his men should be given up. On his arrival at Cape Coast Castle a grand palaver was held, in which were present the Governor and Council, the principal merchants at Cape Coast and its vicinity, the chiefs and head men of Cape Coast, the runaway chief, as well as the King's messengers. After a long palaver, the last were unable to substantiate the charges against the man, who swore that he would rather have his head cut off before the fort gate than that he should be sent up to Comasie. After long deliberation it was unanimously agreed that the captain and his followers were not to be delivered up until the King should send down witnesses to corroborate the charges alleged against him. The King demanded that the men should be delivered up unconditionally; or, if not, the Governor must stand the consequence. During this time it was noticed that Ashantees, who came down as peaceful traders, bought almost wholly guns, powder, and lead bar, articles which are decidedly munitions of war. The chiefs in the interior got alarmed at this, and seized the articles as the men passed along their territory. Intelligence of this reached Comasie, and from that time the King gave orders to his captains to make preparations for an invasion. In the meantime the King sent to inform the Governor that he had broken the treaty with his Government, and that he (the King) was going to send down one of his captains, who was then in the interior, to show the Governor the treaty. The Governor promised, whenever that should be done, to deliver the captain up, and even escort him to the frontiers of the King of Ashantee with British soldiers. The next information that reached the coast was that a large Ashantee army had crossed the river Prah (the boundary line between the protectorate territory and the kingdom of his Majesty King Quaku Duah) towards the eastern district, and that the King of Akim had fallen back before them to get the support of the tribes on the seashore. A few days afterwards another army crossed the Prah at Assin, in a direct road to Anamaboe and Cape Coast. Most of the men on the seacoast who are able to bear arms have left for the Fantee camp, at the neighbourhood of Assin, where at least about 14,000 men are at present, waiting the movements of the Ashantees. Scouts have been sent out, and some Ashantee heads have been sent down, to corroborate the report that the Ashantees have invaded the Fantee territory. The report is just now current that pickets of the army of Ajeman, King of Western Akim, met an Ashantee pillaging band, fired at them, and wounded their leader, who was brought before the King as a prisoner. He begged hard for his life, and promised to reveal everything about the war. He was made to swear by his King's stool that all that he was about to say were facts. The information he gave was the following: The King, on hearing that the Governor refused to deliver up the men, turned out all the available force, numbering about 60,000 men. Of these, 20,000 were to form a corps of observation on the eastern district, by descending on Akim, and thus preventing the Accras, Aquamhus, and Akims from joining the Fantees, and the remaining 40,000 were to descend upon the Fantees through Assin, sweeping everything before them, until they arrive at Cape Coast and Anamaboe, both of which places they intend to sack; the victorious were then to march against the Accras. So that, perhaps before you receive this account, we might all have been massacred by these brutal Ashantees; but we are determined to give them a most hearty reception.""}, {'id': 6635, 'article_title': 'The Execution of an Englishman in the Congo State', 'full_section_title': 'The Execution of an Englishman in the Congo State', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1895#article-10', 'issue_date': '01_10_1895', 'content': ""In our last number, we briefly alluded to the fact that an Englishman named Stokes had been summarily hanged by the Belgian authorities early in the year, the plea being that, in spite of international arrangements and treaties, he was in the habit of supplying the Arabs with firearms and ammunition.

In the first place, it is clear that he tried Mr. Stokes and sentenced him to death by Court-martial. The law of the Congo State, however, expressly provides that its officers shall not pass the capital sentence on any civilian without a previous trial at Boma. If this be so it seems to have been directly broken by Captain Lothaire, for Mr. Stokes could not forfeit his status as a civilian by selling rifles and ammunition to Kibonge and promising to help him against the expedition. Next, if it was competent to try Mr. Stokes by Court-martial at all, it has to be proved that the Court-martial was regularly constituted. We know, on the authority of the Belgian accounts, that Dr. Michaux protested against the execution, and, presumably, against the trial, and that two officers refused to sit upon the Court. Apparently they were the only two officers with the expedition, for, as they would not serve, Captain Lothaire called upon two non-commissioned officers to sit in their stead. The tribunal, therefore, would seem to have consisted of the commander of the expedition and two non-commissioned officers. Is that a proper tribunal to try issues of life and death? Both from a sense of discipline and from consciousness of their own unfitness to act as Judges such men would naturally defer to the opinions of the president of the tribunal. The president in this case seems to have left them in no doubt as to what those opinions were. He declared that the acts of Mr. Stokes amounted to ""trahison"" and to ""a flagrant participation in the war against the Free State."" He was equally clear as to the penalty. He pronounced these crimes worthy of death. Apparently the non-commissioned officers assented to their commandant\'s views upon both points, for Mr. Stokes was a dead man a few hours later. There may be a perfect justification of all that Captain Lothaire has done. It certainly looks as if the circumstances in which Mr. Stokes was arrested were highly suspicious. Kibonge was a notorious villain, and the letters, if authentic, would be a terrible evidence of complicity. But three points have to be made out to clear Captain Lothaire. He has to show, first, that he had a right to try Mr. Stokes on a capital charge at all; secondly, that the accused was guilty; and, thirdly, that he was tried by a properly-constituted Court and with due regard for regular procedure. The attempt being made in certain quarters to exempt the Congo State from liability for the acts of its officers cannot be successful in this country. That State is dependent upon the good will of the Powers, and it would commit a grave error of judgment if it sought to shirk responsibility for any blunders committed by its representatives.'}]","[{'document_title': 'BEFORE THE LAW COURTS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '**SIERRA LEONE PROTECTORATE ORDINANCE.**—An Ordinance came into force on Jan. 1, intended for the regulation, not of Sierra Leone proper, but of the adjacent territory over which H.M.

Prempeh, who, at first, seemed to be somewhat alarmed at his sudden removal, soon got to be reconciled to his fate when once he was on board.

To put a man to death without trial, and then to levy heavy duties on his property, savours more of brigandage than of the processes of civilisation. We are not surprised to learn, therefore, that ""relations continue to be strained between Lord Salisbury and the Congo Administration.""

They have got it into their heads that we attach very high value to the co-operation of the Dhansis expedition with our forces at Uganda. Of course, it is the interest of both Powers to stand together against the Dervishes on the Upper Nile; but that interest is not so paramount in the case of England as to necessitate submission to insult. Even if it were so there can never be real friendship between Great Britain and the Congo State until the murder of Mr. Stokes is compensated for, so far as compensation can go. To award his relations a certain sum, none too liberal, and forthwith to take it back is a mockery of justice which does not comport with British notions.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-01-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_01_1897#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.754, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE CONGO STATE AND THE STOKES AFFAIR', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A despatch was received in Brussels, on Dec. 15, by the Free State Administration announcing a decisive victory by the Native troops, under Major Lothaire, over the insurgents who are responsible for the recent disturbances in the district of Luluaburg. The action took place on Oct. 18 on the right bank of the Lomami, and resulted in the complete defeat of the rebel forces, who, according to the version received by the Administration, were practically cut to pieces. As the result of Major Lothaire\'s victory, the mutiny may be considered as definitely stamped out. The rebels suffered enormous loss, and Major Lothaire took a very large number of prisoners. The few who escaped took refuge in the country of the chief Dibue, who assisted the insurgents. Prior to this engagement two detachments of troops, commanded respectively by Major Michaux and another Congo State officer named Swenson, had encounters with the rebels. Major Michaux was defeated, but M. Swenson routed his opponents.\n\nMajor Lothaire\'s victory over the rebels on the Upper Congo will doubtless prove a fortunate circumstance for him in connexion with his trial for complicity in the death of Mr. Stokes. An old colleague of Major Lothaire, who has had exceptional opportunities of studying his methods in Africa, affirms that he is one of the most capable officers in the service of the Free State, and ""one of the best of the lot,"" apart from his ability as an officer. He is a very strong-willed man, apt at times to act before due thought, and to this defect in Lothaire\'s character is to be attributed his unjustifiable conduct in reference to Mr. Stokes. When the news of the murder of Mr. Stokes first became known the officials of the Free State in Brussels were anxious as far as possible to shield Major Lothaire, but subsequently, when King Leopold and his advisers found into what a serious difficulty Major Lothaire\'s action had landed them, a feeling of considerable irritation against him gained ground. Now, however, that he has again rendered such signal service by crushing what promised to be a most formidable rebellion in the neighbourhood of Luluabourg, he may fairly count on a revival of the old feeling that everything will be done to minimise the punishment for what, from the Free State point of view, was an error of judgment joined to an excess of zeal. In any case, it is understood that the formal charge against Major Lothaire will not be that of murder, but one of a much less serious character.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1896#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.747, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Execution of an Englishman in the Congo State', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It may be gathered from a question put by Mr. H. M. Stanley in the House of Commons that Mr. Stokes was a Protestant Irishman from Ulster, that he went out to Africa as a missionary, and that since 1879 he had acted as a trader in East Africa, and had gained great influence over the Natives. He is said also to have ""established"" Mwanga, a circumstance which seems to indicate that he occasionally meddled in Native politics. According to the statements of a Belgian newspaper, Mr. Stokes was in the neighbourhood of Kilunga, a village on a tributary of the Aruwimi, about the end of last year; and at the close of December Capt. Lothaire, who had left Stanley Falls with a strong party in order to attack the Arab chief Kibonge, reached the same place. On his arrival Capt. Lothaire found Kibonge already a prisoner. At the same time Capt. Lothaire received letters from a British merchant, who claimed protection for his ivory and goods, which he desired to carry towards the East Coast. This merchant was Mr. Stokes. Capt. Lothaire found amongst Kibonge\'s property letters from Mr. Stokes, and other letters from Mr. Stokes were also handed to him by different chiefs. In these letters Mr. Stokes informed Kibonge that he would join him against the forces of the Congo State, and made suggestions as to how the attack of the expedition should be withstood. These letters, it is stated, corroborated other information given to Captain Lothaire by several chiefs to the effect that Mr. Stokes had sold large quantities of arms and ammunition to Kibonge for use in the war against the Congo State. Captain Lothaire thereupon sent forward two of his lieutenants with orders to arrest Mr. Stokes and to confiscate his stores and ivory as prize of war. When Mr. Stokes was brought in to Kilunga he was taken before a court-martial, and it is alleged that he acknowledged the authenticity of the letters and admitted the sale of the munitions of war, and that such sale had been made for the purpose of making war upon the Congo State. The ""commandant,"" according to this report, declared that the acts admitted by Mr. Stokes constituted ""a flagrant participation in the war against the Free State which merited death."" He was sentenced to be hanged and was executed on the spot. Another account holds that at the worst Captain Lothaire can only be deemed guilty of ""having acted irregularly through excess of zeal."" It affirms that two officers who accompanied Captain Lothaire refused to take part in the Court-martial upon Mr. Stokes; and from a third Belgian paper we learn that Dr. Michaux, who was attached to the expedition, protested against the execution; that early in the morning, after the trial, he got up and begged Captain Lothaire to tell him where the prisoner was as he desired to speak to him, and that thereupon Captain Lothaire showed him the dead body of Mr. Stokes hanging from a bamboo. It is added that Dr. Michaux repeated his protest and insisted on returning to Stanley Falls, and that Captain Lothaire gave him an escort for the journey.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1895#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.768, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Internal Condition of the Congo Free State', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'According to a statement made to a representative of Reuter\'s Agency by a missionary who has lately returned from the Congo, things must be in a very parlous state there. The substance of the statement is appended, but our readers need hardly be reminded that as the name of the missionary is not made public the account must be accepted with much caution. The whole truth, he says, regarding the situation on the Congo can never be made public by anyone who has to return there. The State officers are so far from any central control that if they heard that the missionaries, for instance, had said anything, they would retaliate by attacking the Natives round the stations, even if the white men were not themselves hurt. As to the Stokes affair. I know nothing personally of that incident. I do know Captain Lothaire, however, and therefore was not surprised. He, in common with a few other State officers who could be named, is held in special awe by the Natives. The people on the Lulanga River called him ""Lofembe,"" meaning mist, by reason of his mysterious movements. Lothaire is by no means the worst of the Congo officers, as there are many in the State service who have a still worse reputation among the Natives. The following is a specimen of Captain Lothaire\'s actions. Some four years ago he arrived with some black troops at a point opposite the mission station of Eulongo. Finding the Natives had fled on hearing of his approach, he pitched his camp on an island facing the station, and sent over to the missionary asking him to use his influence to get the Natives back, and promising a three days\' truce in order to hold a palaver. The missionary, supposing he was dealing with an officer and a gentleman, induced the Natives to come into the station. As soon as they did so, Lothaire and his men opened fire on them and killed a number. Naturally, the Natives attributed this treachery to the missionaries, and later, when Lothaire sent word to another mission station that he was about to visit it, the missionary warned the Natives around the station not to return if they were sent for. One important thing connected with the Stokes affair seems to have been overlooked. It is that Stokes had been robbed of a caravan worth £4,000, and it is quite likely that many of the arms found by the State officers on the Natives formed part of the booty. This being so, it is scarcely probable that the people would admit having stolen them, but would be much more likely to declare that they had got them from the British trader. This might happen in the case of any trading or mission station being looted by the Natives, as materials for purposes of shooting game, as well as for defence, are always kept in readiness, including perhaps a thousand cartridges. If these were found on the Natives the State officials might as readily declare that they had got them from the British. This does not affect the action of Captain Lothaire one way or the other, but it throws an important side light on the affair.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1895#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.777, 'probability_score': 0.07, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Internal Condition of the Congo Free State', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'An Englishman lately returned to England after some years\' residence on the Congo, said with regard to the above interview: While all the cases referred have not come under my personal observation, I regret I am unable to deny the general charges of inefficiency and brutality made against the State officials. The chief object of the officers is to get rubber and ivory at any price rather than to civilise, and they make no scruples in setting one tribe against another, using the stronger as a catspaw to obtain the ivory from the weaker. Great loss of life is the result, and it is no wonder we hear at intervals of officers being massacred. In addition to the ivory in the Native villages, the river is closely watched. A canoe laden with ivory is seen coming down the river in the evening, and signals are made for the Natives to stop and bring in their goods on the usual terms—that is to say, at a much lower price than could be obtained from any independent trader. Of course, the Natives paddle away as fast as possible, whereupon they are at once fired on and either killed or compelled to bring in their ivory. Another serious matter—one which is attracting the attention of the British Government—is the wholesale recruiting by Belgian agents of British subjects in Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and Barbadoes. Although, as the result of representations made to the Colonial Governments concerned this is being gradually suppressed, at one time almost every ship brought a number of men who had entered into contracts with the State to act as labourers. Once in the Congo the word ""travailleur"" was erased, and ""soldat"" substituted. Comparatively few of these people ever return to the coast. They die in the interior, usually of starvation. The result of all this is that hundreds of miles of the country are desolate, and that the Natives are leaving for the French sphere.\n\nIt is only fair to say that the high officials on the coast are not wholly responsible for this, and that some slight attempt is made at Boma, for instance, to educate the children, and so forth. The interior is in a constant state of siege, and legitimate trade is stagnated. There can be no doubt that had the Congo people the power of cohesion, the Belgians would have long since been swept out of the country, and that the British and other foreigners, who are all classed as whites, would have shared a similar fate. The suspicion entertained by one tribe of another is the Belgians\' only safety.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1895#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.729, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Leader', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""might arise which would render communication with the Governor, stationed so far away, difficult or practically impossible, and in these cases much must be left to the discretion of the commander of the expedition. The whole detail of the circumstances is not very clear; but it would seem that Inspector Dalrymple felt himself compelled to resort to force, with the result that the natives turned against him, and treacherously shot him down—we use the word advisedly, because Mr. Dalrymple's death was not the result of warfare or even of a riot, but he was shot at from an ambuscade. So far the case is clear, and there can be few who will deny that swift punishment should be meted out to those who were concerned in the murder—if only from the necessity of showing that the person of a British officer in the execution of his duty, and that mainly in the cause of peace and civilisation, must be respected. But the punishment in this case, all must admit, was terribly excessive, and calculated to do vast injury to the British cause. When these terrible events were known, orders were given at Accra to Assistant-Inspector Akers, with a colleague, to proceed with a force of sixty-three Houssa soldiers, who pursued the people about the bush, the number slain being between 500 and 600! And the modified disapproval of this action afforded in Lord Knutsford's despatch upon the subject is not at all what we should have liked to see. No doubt there are many difficulties to be considered and allowed for, in a country and among a people who have only the merest rudiments of civilisation. But our Colonial Empire was never built up on such a policy, and something more than a milk-and-water reprimand should have been sent from Downing Street to make the officials show some decent respect for human life. Mr. Picton's motion was ultimately defeated in the House of Commons by a large majority—probably because it was felt that the discussion which arose out of it was sure to do good, perhaps even more so than a distinct vote against the Government. As to the three people who were acquitted on the charge of procuring the murder of Mr. Dalrymple, it is quite conceivable that the Governor is acting for the best in detaining them in custody, for the present at least; but we hope to hear before long that the pacification of the district is so far advanced as to permit of their discharge."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-06-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_06_1889#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Condition of the Congo State', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The heads of expeditions and the District Commissioners must specially watch that their subordinates, to whatever category they belong, employ in their dealings with Natives the tact necessary to avert the conflicts which might arise from misunderstandings or practices conflicting too roughly with the customs and usages of the Natives.

It may well be supposed that the country is in a disturbed state. The people of the district of Lake Mantumba, of Irebu, and Lokolala and all the Mobangi towns have crossed over to the French side. Going over to the French side meant that they would become homeless and hungry wanderers. Even then the State could not leave them in peace; they heard that they came over at night to their old homes to get food, and they stationed canoes and lay in wait for them, with orders to shoot all they caught, and to my knowledge they shot seven people in one night.

Their condition is deplorable, and needs our sympathy, as well as all that European public opinion can do to secure for them the blessings of a righteous government under which they can live in peace.\n\nRegarding the State officers and their manner of administration, Mr. Murphy said: ""The white officers do not know the language of the people they govern, and trust too much to their Native soldiers, who are, as a rule, men belonging to a hostile tribe, whose chief aim in life is to plunder. These men are sent out to fight very often without any responsible officer being with them, with the result that many cruelties are perpetrated which might have been avoided.

Whether they spoke to merchants, to travellers, to scientific men, to explorers, or anybody who had ever had relations with the Congo, they would not find one who regarded with anything but aversion the possibility of Portugal being planted in that most important region. Finally, as he had said, the Portuguese Government urged in this dispatch that there should be some civilized jurisdiction on the banks of the Congo. Well, he would not say that a civilized jurisdiction, in which the natives could have confidence, in which the merchants could have confidence, and which would produce a better state of things than now existed—he would not say that such a jurisdiction might not be desirable. It ought to be within the capacity of England and the other powers of Europe to establish such a jurisdiction if it was necessary. But the jurisdiction of Portugal would not be such a jurisdiction as he had described. In the very case he had spoken of in which the British Consul asked the Portuguese Governor to punish the murderers of the thirty negroes, after an inquiry had been held, the Consul had a belief that it was altogether unsatisfactory, and that it was not a real inquiry. And it would be easy to show that in the Portuguese Colonies of Africa deeds probably as horrible—certainly many very dreadful deeds—were perpetrated which did not meet with any adequate punishment. Some newspapers, the Times for instance—and he thought also the Manchester Guardian, the other day—leaned somewhat to the view that on some terms or other Portugal might perhaps be allowed to go to this region. What did the merchants say? They said, We would not have Portugal on any terms; we do not trust her; no kind of bargain which she might make with us would give us any kind of security. In the despatch he had spoken of, Portugal said, Of course if we go to the Congo it will be an exception; we won’t establish the tariffs, and we won’t do there as in other colonies. That was very much like an admission that her other colonies were not in a very satisfactory state. She said that if she went to the Congo her tariff should not exceed the lowest tariff that existed in any part of the world. He scarcely knew where the lowest tariff existed, but he supposed it was in Turkey. If Portugal said, We will never have a higher tariff than five per cent., or seven or eight per cent., that would give no kind of security to the merchants of these various countries. They might bind Portugal to that agreement, but what were they to do with regard to her internal government, her internal taxation, with regard to the wonderful capacity she had of obstructing and delaying every kind of commercial proceeding, however small? (Hear, hear.) The Portuguese Government said not only that they would have very low duties, but that the navigation of the river should be absolutely free. But unless the banks of a river were free, how could the river be said to be free? (Hear, hear.) Although there was considerable commerce on the Congo, it was not so great as to induce ocean steamers to go from the sea up the 115 miles of river on which they could ply without difficulty if they chose to do so. Goods were unloaded and put upon smaller vessels to go up the stream. If Portugal was planted on the Congo, with all her machinery of custom houses, and all her genius for delay, what would become of the trade represented by the goods that would have to be unloaded and reloaded in Portuguese possessions? Men who talked glibly about putting Portugal on the banks of the Congo and abolishing the sway of the native chiefs, should remember the important fact of the difference betwixt the two provinces of Zanzibar and Mozambique. Mozambique was a great province on the eastern coast of Africa, and alongside of it was Zanzibar. Zanzibar, which was under native rule, had a trade eight or ten times as large as Mozambique, which was a province of Portugal. (Hear, hear.) The British Government for half a century had exercised an influence which had kept the Congo region free, and made it impossible for Portugal to go there. He contended that the influence which had done this in the past might do it in the future; and he should have very little faith in, or admiration for, the statesmanship of England or the statesmanship of Europe, if it allowed a region so important now and so promising for the future to be blighted by passing into the possession of such a power as Portugal.

The cablegram says the Governor was stopped by the French and Konnohs at Coongeah, or Loongeah, and that they threatened to kill him. The Governor in question is Colonel F. Cardew, who sailed from Liverpool on February 28 last to take up the administration of the Sierra Leone colony in succession to Sir Francis Fleming. Colonel Cardew appears to have lost no time in going into the interior. The Konnohs are the tribe that attempted to stop the advance of the West India Regiment under the command of the late Colonel Ellis, just prior to the deplorable French and English collision. The West Indians at that time drove the Konnohs before them from place to place, and it was then thought that they had received a lesson that would have lasted them for years. It is therefore feared that they have taken courage at some action of the French, although it is scarcely believed that the French would incite them to oppose the English Governor. It is also not credited here that the threat to kill the Governor was made by the French, but must have been on the part of the Konnohs. Loongeah or Coongeah cannot be located, but there is an important town called Lungay, between Tagreer and Scarciss on the Bullon Shore in the Kaffwee-Bullon district.

633,Governor Freeman's inability to respect local customs and his postponed visit to Abeokuta underscore the diplomatic challenges and tensions between British colonial authorities and African leaders.,"The claim that Governor Freeman's inability to respect local customs and his postponed visit to Abeokuta underscore the diplomatic challenges and tensions between British colonial authorities and African leaders is supported by observations from both the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit in different ways. The textbook does not specifically mention Governor Freeman or his interactions with Abeokuta, nor does it directly address any postponed visits or disrespect for local customs by him. However, it highlights broader themes of diplomatic challenges and tensions between British colonial authorities and African leaders, such as the general strategy of colonial administrators to manage relationships between traditional and new African elites, often leading to dissatisfaction and conflict. It also describes instances where African leaders, like Prempeh I of Asante and Jaja of Opobo, resisted colonial impositions, indicating a pattern of tension and resistance to colonial authority. These examples align with the claim's theme of diplomatic challenges but do not provide specific details about Freeman or Abeokuta. In contrast, The African Times articles provide specific details supporting the claim, noting that Governor Freeman's visit to Abeokuta was postponed due to the absence of key Egba leaders, reflecting a lack of coordination and respect for local customs. The articles also highlight Freeman's unsuccessful attempts to secure an interview with the chiefs of Abeokuta, suggesting strained relations and communication breakdowns. Additionally, Freeman's imposition of Calabar mats, which led to unrest, is criticized as a disregard for local conditions and customs. These details align with the claim that Freeman's actions contributed to diplomatic challenges and tensions. However, the articles also mention efforts by other British officials, like Acting Governor Glover, to improve relations, indicating that the challenges were not solely due to Freeman's actions but part of broader colonial administrative issues.","The provided paragraphs from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook do not specifically mention Governor Freeman or his interactions with Abeokuta, nor do they directly address any postponed visits or disrespect for local customs by him.

The few exceptions included, notably, General (later Marshal) Lyautey in Morocco, Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard in Northern Nigeria and Sir Gordon Guggisberg in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators. There is among the whole of this badly payed and very wretched elite - as remote from indigenous society, from which it has been driven out, as it is from European society into which it is not admitted - a feeling of disillusionment, discontent and bitterness which it would prove dangerous to be unaware of. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The state of African preparedness', 'content': 'What was the attitude of the Africans themselves to the establishment of colonialism, involving as it did such a fundamental change in the nature of the relationships that had existed between them and the Europeans over the preceding three hundred years?

The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy. Asante must remain as of old at the same time to remain friendly with all white men. I do not write this in a boastful spirit but in the clear sense of its meaning ... the cause of Asante is progressing and there is no reason for any Asante man to feel alarm at the prospects or to believe for a single instant that our cause has been driven back by the events of the past hostilities. 2\nIn 1895, Wobogo, the Moro Naba, or King of the Mossi (in modern Upper Volta), told the French officer, Captain Destenave: I know that the whites wish to kill me in order to take my country, and yet you claim that they will help me to organize my country. But I find my country good just as it is. I have no need of them.

This, of course, would not be tolerated in that age, and using the killing of the British acting consul-general and five other Englishmen on their way to Benin as an excuse, the British launched a punitive expedition of 1500 men against Benin in 1897. Though the Oba himself would have liked to submit, a majority of his chiefs raised an army to beat back the invasion.

He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order.

The rulers of Nembe (Brass), lying on the main Nun estuary of the Niger, were involved in quarrels between exploring and trading British expeditions and local peoples from the 1830s when British citizens got killed or shot at. The final showdown came in 1895, when the Nembe attacked the major depot of the Royal Niger Company at the port of Akassa and destroyed it. This was in protest against the Company's attempt to establish monopoly trade all the way up from Akassa in the delta to Lokoja at the Niger-Benue confluence.

First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante.

At the same time, their resident ambassadors and representatives treated the Liberians with contempt and frequently imposed on her by denouncing her trade, customs and citizenship laws or bullying her to redress their nationals' grievances as Britain did in September 1869, August 1870, April 1871, February and June 1882, November 1886 and finally January 1909. 89 Germany similarly brought in her gunboats to intimidate Liberia in February and October 1881, in August 1897, January and September 1898 and December 1912. On each occasion, the German government demanded financial indemnity ranging between $3000 and $60000 from the Liberian government on mostly trivial grounds, particularly alleged 'insults' by Liberian officials to the German consul or German merchants in Liberia who invited the German intervention.\nThe three years 1907-9 witnessed an unprecedented escalation of this interference by Britain, France and Germany culminating in the famous 'Cadell Incident' of n and 12 February 1909. The issues involved included the obvious deplorable economic, social and political conditions in Liberia, the rivalry among European powers for influence and territory in Liberia at Liberia's expense and Liberians' indebtedness to these powers or their nationals."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.631, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Foreign intervention in Liberia and Ethiopia, 1915-35 > Liberia', 'content': 'First, the Liberian government\'s penury and perennial indebtedness partly led to increased foreign control of Liberia\'s financial administration by the International Receivership, the Bank of British West Africa, and Firestone interests supported by the United States government.

Secondly, Liberia\'s unfavourable economic, social and administrative conditions became a major issue in the bitter political rivalry between the True Whig and People\'s parties and attracted considerable international attention.

The tensions reached such a pitch that Boshof was forced into a tactical resignation in February 1858 and, when he withdrew his resignation, several members of the volksraad left in protest. Coupled with the internal disputes were the increasing border quarrels with Lesotho. Boshof decided to check the border disputes by invading Lesotho in March 1858. By converging on Thaba Bosiu, Moshoeshoe's stronghold, the Boer commandos left their rear exposed, which was then raided by the Lesotho army. The Boers abandoned the struggle as they went back home to defend their families and property.

The Transvaal made it clear that it could only assist the Orange Free State in return for the latter's absorption by the Transvaal. The prospect of unity between the two republics alarmed Grey, who was already contemplating federating the individual republics with the British colonies.

He therefore started calling for the abrogation of the conventions and for the re-establishment of British rule under some form of federation. He feared that fragmentation of the whites weakened them in the face of the ubiquitous African states.

By that, he made it impossible for himself ever to have really friendly relations with people so jealous and tenacious about etiquette as the Egbas are.

A person of colour who conceives himself to have been injured by some former acts of the Governor has for months past been staying in Abeokuta, exerting all his influence to prevent a rapprochement between the authorities of the two places, whose interests are so closely united.

Such constant changes of rulers are great evils; and in the case of Lieutenant-Governor Glover, who is now for the second time acting in that capacity, another change of that kind would, I think, be unfair.

But those sixteen months had been an unprecedented period for his subjects. Too much had occurred in too short a period, and people had not had enough time to digest the many rapid changes of policies, which were so different from those pursued by his predecessor. The treaties and the charters he had signed had angered the men who had helped him succeed to the throne; and the influence of the missionaries and other foreigners was growing so fast that many of his influential officials were alarmed. There was such discontent at the new policies that during the Ratnanenjana epidemic, those affected claimed that they were possessed by the spirit of the late Queen Rana valona. The climax came when Radama decided to remove from power Rainivoninahitriniony, the Prime Minister; Rainilaiarivony his younger brother; and Rainijohary. All three were leading members of the two clans of Tsimiamboholahy and Tsimahafotsy which, as we have noted, had assisted Andrianampoinimerina to found the Merina kingdom.

It thus became Radama's first task to subdue these rebels, particularly the Bezanozano of Ambotomanga, many of whom fled to the east. Although Radama succeeded in consolidating his position in Imerina, what he desired most was to reach the sea, as his father had directed him to do on his deathbed. Without direct access to the sea, the Merina felt hemmed in by their neighbours, who even raided them for slaves. Merina traders, increasingly anxious to trade at the ports of Tamatave and Majunga directly with Europeans, especially the British in the Mascarene Islands, were forced instead to exchange their handicrafts, rice, beef and other agricultural produce for European salt and ammunition through Bezanozano, Sihanaka and Sakalava intermediaries. Radama saw territorial expansion as part of the heritage of the Maroseranana that he had taken over and, above all, as a filial duty to respect the wishes of his ancestors and fulfil the predictions of soothsayers. 10 It was to the east - towards the increasingly important port of Tamatave that Radama's eyes were first focused. However, the political situation in the surrounding Betsimisaraka area called for intervention. The confederation organized in the eighteenth century by Ratsimilaho had broken up into a multitude of rival principalities at war one with another, and riddled with internal challengers, generally opposed to the authority of the filoha (ruling chiefs), who invited Radama to intervene.

His desire to reach the sea coincided with Farquhar's desire - and that of England - to control Madagascar, or at least to influence events there, since Madagascar was the sole source of the cattle and rice imported to Mauritius as well as an important consumer of Mauritius's manufactured goods.

He welcomed back his old friends, Laborde and Lambert, and other Europeans.

The demand for this inheritance emanating from Paris was founded on the treaty of 1868, which empowered French nationals to acquire landed property in Madagascar, while the refusal of the authorities in Antananarivo to countenance it rested on the law stipulating that land belonged exclusively to the sovereign. The 'Laborde inheritance' case posed a problem of land ownership that was of direct concern to the settlers and traders living on the island. The issue at stake was whether they were entitled to own the land they worked or could at least expect to obtain a long-term leasehold on it. 7\nIn April 1881, relations between France and Madagascar became even more acrimonious over the ToalØ affair. The ToalØ was a dhow whose owner - an Arab but a French subject - together with three other Muslim members of the crew, were murdered by the men of the Sakalava king, Bakary, in the bay of Marambitsy, an area outside the control of the Merina authorities. These people, who were gunrunners, had been verbally challenged and ordered to hand over their cargo; instead, they opened fire on the Sakalava, who fired back and killed them. The French claimed reparation from the Queen of Madagascar for this smuggling incident. 8"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Madagascar 1800-80', 'section_title': 'The open-door policy: King Radama II, 1861-63', 'content': ""realized that the king was set on eradicating them.

In December 1828 the Ranavalona's govern› ment told Robert Lyall, the new British Resident, that although they would not reintroduce the slave trade, they did not wish to continue with the treaty, nor did they consider his presence in their capital necessary any longer. Trade between Madagascar and the islands of Mauritius and RØunion was banned. General Brady, who had been naturalized as a Malagasy and given noble rank by Radama I, was forced into retirement in 1829. Madagascar's disillusionment with foreign powers was heightened when, in 1829, Charles X's government in France, desirous to raise its prestige at home, ordered the bombardment and occupation of Tintingue and Tamatave, following a series of misunderstandings with the Malagasy over the French presence at Tintingue, opposite the island of Sainte-Marie.

These different movements joined forces to recall and defend France's 'historic rights' over Madagascar. That claim, which had its roots in the memory of the annexation proclaimed under Louis XIV and of the fruitless attempts made in the eighteenth century to set up a prosperous France Orientale, based on the trading posts established in the eighteenth century and under the Restoration, was developed throughout the nineteenth century in a large number of written documents before being put to the French parliament officially in 1884. The RØunion lobby demanded the complete conquest of the island, so that the overflow of Reunion's Creole population could be settled there and the abundant resources which the British seemed likely to exploit could be reserved for their own use. French Catholic missionaries in Madagascar, for their part, were reduced to evangelizing the lower social classes since most of the noble families and the rich and powerful commoners had been converted to Protestantism. Consequently they demanded official support from France in their bid to overcome the competition of the Protestants, whom they portrayed as being a product of the innumerable 'underhand dealings' of the British. This 'perfidious Albion' theory found a favourable echo in certain business circles which, in an endeavour to conquer the Malagasy market at the expense of the British and Americans, sought to debar the latter by annexing the island rather than by reducing the prices of their own goods. Colonial propaganda appealed to people's chauvinistic sentiments and the belief in France's humanitarian and civilizing mission.

It was Sir Robert's desire, therefore, to pursue an active political role in Madagascar. This policy, coinciding as it did with Radama's own determination to expand to the east, was to have, as one writer has put it, 'important consequences for the future of Madagascar'. 12 After several friendly contacts, Farquhar sent a diplomatic mission, led by Captain Le Sage, which arrived in Antananarivo on 21 December 1816. A treaty of friendship and commerce was eventually signed on 4 February 1817 between Radama and Le Sage. But this treaty did not satisfy the Mauritian Governor because it did not mention the slave trade, a matter of considerable importance to Sir Robert. The Governor therefore sent another mission to Radama's capital, this time led by James Hastie, a former Sergeant at Arms in India and more experienced in handling negotiations with oriental rulers.$^{13}$ Hastie brought along with him a number of gifts for the king, including horses, a compass, a map of the world and a chiming clock, all of which greatly impressed the young king and helped Hastie to win his love and confidence. The negotiations, however, stumbled over the British insistence that Radama should outlaw the slave trade in Madagascar. When Radama argued that by doing this he would be com› mitting economic suicide because the slave trade was the major source of his revenue, Hastie had a ready answer: the British would pay the Malagasy ruler an annual sum of 1000 dollars in gold, 1000 dollars in silver, a hundred barrels of gunpowder, 100 English muskets with 100 flints, 400 soldiers' uniforms, 12 sergeants' swords, 600 pieces of cloth, a full-dress uniform for himself and 2 horses as compensation.$^{14}$ Radama considered that he had made a fair deal, especially since the treaty also recognized him as king of the whole of Madagascar.

In this lies their determination to continue to promote Western education and establish industries to produce those goods which they needed but which could not now be imported from outside. In maintaining commercial contacts with the outside world, the Queen used the services of a French national called de Lastelle, who was established at Tamatave, and an American national called William Marks at Majunga. With the support of de Lastelle, sugar plantations were established on the eastern coast, and a factory was installed at Mahela producing sugar and rum.31 The Queen engaged Jean Laborde, a French adventurer, who arrived in Antananarivo in 1832 'as a kind of general superintendent of works'. He first established a factory at Ilafy, 10 km north of Antananarivo before moving to Mantasoa, on the edge of the eastern forest in a region rich in running water but where it was difficult to get the Malagasy to work willingly. At Mantasoa, with official backing, he established an industrial complex employing some 20000 workers. This produced various goods ranging from guns and cannon to glass and soap. Perhaps Laborde's greatest and most lasting creation was the wooden palace of the Queen, later enclosed in stone by Cameron, which now dominates Antananarivo. De Lastelle and Laborde became Malagasy citizens and were incorporated into the ruling oligarchy. 32 Queen Ranavalona continued the expansion which Radama I had begun and consolidated her administration in the conquered territories. The equipment of her army necessitated the prosecution of external trade to obtain ammunition and the encouragement of gun production at Laborde's factory. She levied special taxes for the support of the wars. The town of Fianarantsoa was created in 1831 as a regional capital, and the province of Betsileo was reorganized.

The Malagasy had developed the planting of rice to such a high degree of specialization that one observer remarked 'that in few things is the industry and ingenuity of the Malagasy shown more than in the cultivation of rice.'64 Besides agriculture, the economy of Madagascar depended on the rearing of cattle, particularly among the Sakalava in the west and the people in the south of the island. Sheep and pigs reared on the central plateau, and fish, formed major food items among the Malagasy.

From the very outset of the French demands on the Hovas Government we foresaw and stated in this journal our belief that the acquisition of the whole Island would be found to be the aim and purpose of the French Government—that the French Government had been instigated to this by the Planter interest of Réunion—that these not only desired the sugar-lands of Madagascar, but facilities for obtaining labourers now that the supply of coolies from India was cut off—and that the result would be a speedy increase of activity in the East African foreign slave-trade. We at the same time stated our conviction that the Hovas Government and people would offer a strenuous and persistent opposition to the French demands, rendering it necessary for France to employ considerable naval and land forces. Events have not been slow in proving the correctness of our opinion. Late information, of which we give the substance in another column, states that on the occasion of the coronation of the new Queen at Antananarivo on the 22nd of November last, a solemn declaration was made by the Sovereign and her Prime Minister that not an inch of Malagasy territory would be surrendered to the French. Only a few days before the reception of this news in Paris there had been articles in influential Paris journals, believed to be inspired by the French Government authorities, to the effect that no treaty of any kind with the Hovas for rights over a portion of the Island was to be thought of—that the Hovas Government was one that would not respect any such treaty even if made, and, therefore, that nothing ought to or would satisfy France short of a protectorate by the latter over the entire island. The French Government have, no doubt, been feeling the pulse of all the European Governments, and that of the United States of America; and having arrived at the full conviction that not one of them would resist the subjugation of Madagascar by force of arms, have thought the time for concealment of their ultimate views and purposes might now be put an end to, and their determination be revealed by semi-official press statements. Now, although this could not cause us any surprise, because we had so fully foreseen it, it has not the less grieved us. The seed that has been thus sown must produce a great crop of evils. If the Hovas be such as we have always understood them to be, the French will not obtain possession of the Island save through a war of extermination; and this means an amount of human suffering the possibility of which one cannot think of without deep pain. For it must be borne in mind that although neither Great Britain nor the United States would feel justified in breaking the international peace that now happily exists, with the object of preserving the independence of Madagascar, although Great Britain has some large interests involved as regards the necessary supplies for Mauritius, hitherto obtained freely under arrangement with the Hovas Government, yet the cause of the people of Madagascar has strongly aroused the sympathies of large and influential sections of the British and United States' people, many of whom will...""}]","[{'document_title': 'FRANCE AND MADAGASCAR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Malagasy Government has lately published the official correspondence between its Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Consuls of France. A more shameful story of arrogance and high-handed wrong-doing on the part of a first-rate European Power has been seldom given to the world. The first dispute, it seems, arose over the sale of land by the heirs of a former French Consul to a Roman Catholic priest. The Hova Government objected to the sale because the Consul in question, by Malagasy law, which prohibits the owning of land by foreigners, was only a life tenant. Moreover, the title-deeds which the Hova Government declare to have been forged, bore the signature of King Radama II., dated several months after that monarch\'s death. The French Consul attempted to explain this unpleasant fact away by different reckonings of the calendar, but the Hovas are able to prove that not a single document of Radama II.\'s reign bears the date of 1864 except the particular one in dispute. The second dispute arose over the death of four French sailors on the coast. These men were, from the Malagasy standpoint, nothing more nor less than smugglers, who were landing weapons of war and ammunition, contrary to treaty. A Malagasy chief endeavoured to stop this traffic, and was fired upon by the French smugglers, whereupon the fire was returned, with the result that four of the French were killed and the goods in question seized. In the end the Hova Government paid an indemnity under protest. The trumped-up claim of the French to a Protectorate over the North-west Coast rests upon an alleged transfer of power by a certain chief to the French; but, apart from the fact that this man, as a vassal, had no right to alienate lands, the treaty which he did sign only allowed the French to settle for agricultural and commercial purposes, and to keep some armed men ""for their own protection."" We regret to find that the tone of the French officials throughout the controversy is to the last degree insolent and provocative. They appear to have acted upon the principle that weak nations have no rights which France is bound to respect; and that every Frenchman who finds himself in the territory of such a nation has a right to whatever he pleases, no matter what may be the law of the country. It is this kind of treatment of other nations which has more than once drawn down upon France evils and troubles which have shaken the whole commonwealth to its very centre. But we trust the French Ministry will not fail to put an explanation before the world which is worthy of the high position France holds in the front ranks of civilization.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1884#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Situation in Madagascar', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The consequence is that the Madagascar war has been brought on by the hungry rabble; and where do we see a single capitalist or merchant who will stand up for the Malagasy? Another cause which has left the Malagasy all behind in the race is the power of the press against them. Mauritius and Bourbon count ten newspapers which feed the French papers—i.e., about ten millions of readers hear nothing but bad reports about the Hovas. Even the *Merchants\' and Planters\' Gazette* of Mauritius, in its number for May 20, 1884, believes that it is telling the truth when it represents the English and Americans as ""gaining concessions of land which are relentlessly refused to France."" People seem to confound altogether a ""concession"" and a ""lease,"" but the French people do not; and however much Governments pretend not to be influenced by the public press, it is very certain that all these false reports are only provoking jealousy and fanning the flame of war. When the Malagasy Ambassadors went to Europe, even their presence and influence could not withstand the current of false opinions about the Hova people. Then followed the Malagasy official *Gazette*, which now keeps us informed of the truth, but which is hated like a viper because it does publish the truth. The false structure built up by unprincipled agitators is beginning to totter. The idea of impoverishing the Hovas is absurd. Imerina is rich in cattle, its agricultural resources are unbounded; iron, copper, and lead are plentiful for making arms. Cotton is plentiful for weaving. Imerina could supply the London market with eggs and poultry without any appreciable diminution, and as long as the French leave a single creek open, they might just as well...\n\nas well give up blockading altogether, as far as the Hovas are concerned. Wherever the French settle, even if they succeeded in settling anywhere, the natives would desert them, and they would have to import even rice, or plant it themselves. For every agriculturist who settles, they will require two soldiers to guard him, and a doctor to attend him in the fever. The natives will always prefer to work for the English and Americans, who are friendly with the Hovas, for the same wages, and no fear of punishment, than to work for the French under penalty of having their heads cut off. The Hovas have the most powerful weapon against the French as long as they hold Imerina; they have simply to call in foreign capital to start iron works, lead works, sheep-farming on the healthy hills of the interior, and leave the fever-stricken French Creoles with a gun in one hand and a spade in the other to linger out a jeopardised existence.

The misapprehension that still largely prevails, however, justifies a reiteration of the relative positions occupied by the contending parties—the Malagasy and the French—and of the serious consequences entailed upon the leading trading nations of the world by the continuance of the present state of affairs. Summarizing, for the benefit of our readers, the more important facts as contained in the latest news to hand from the island, the first point to be noted is that now the excitement created at the outset is over, a great deal of that bitter feeling always existing at the commencement of wars has worn off, and Mauritians and Bourbonnais, English and French, alike all see that the only result of the war is to bring bankruptcy and ruin on everybody except the Malagasy. Fortunately, there is not the least danger for Madagascar at present, for eleven ships and 4,000 men are of no more use to bring the Malagasy to terms than a circus procession would be. There are about twenty-two well-known ports and creeks on the East Coast, and many more than that on the West Coast; and vessels which are determined upon running a blockade will do so. Even for capturing the Malagasy camp situated within cannon-shot of Tamatave, the French forces are not yet sufficient, much less for a march on the capital. Admiral Miot has already made three attempts to attack the Malagasy camp, but has signally failed. The policy of the Malagasy is strictly defensive, so that the outside world have nothing to expect in the way of thrilling accounts of massacres, and M. Jules Ferry is not likely to have any occasion to appeal to the emotions of the Parisians by draping the beautiful Church La Madeleine in black cloth for the loss of an Admiral or a General or a Minister; consequently the solution of the Madagascar question depends entirely upon the balance of ""plain facts"" which are gradually oozing out as to the real truth of the matter, both for and against the French and Malagasy respectively.\n\nThe origin of the present political and military difficulties is to be traced to the undue immigration of poor settlers—men anxious to find labour, but without capital—from the Mauritius and Bourbon Islands. Now the fact is, the Hovas do not want foreign labour, but they do want foreign capital. The Hovas probably now see that they have opened the road to poor immigrants, and then filled that road with formalities which to the poor man are simply obstructions, instead of opening the road to rich capitalists, to whom the aforesaid obstructions would appear merely legitimate sources of revenue to the Malagasy Government.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1884#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE REVOLUTION IN MADAGASCAR', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Madagascar is so important an island, and may exert so great a future influence as regards Eastern Africa, that the interesting events which have there taken place demand insertion in our columns. But our limited space renders it necessary that we should curtail the Rev. W. Ellis\'s admirable account as much as possible.\n\nDuring the five months in which no intelligence was despatched from Madagascar, the King had evinced certain retrograde and dangerous peculiarities. Mr. Ellis, who writes on the 16th May, says:—\n\n""The King was addicted to many superstitious notions about dreams and spiritual agencies, habitually enforcing any argument with the expression that he believed it, for it was right, because \'God told him so.\' Any account of supernatural appearances or phenomena had a peculiar charm for him, much more so than any direct reasoning upon cause and effect.""\n\nThe persons interested in the continuance of heathen customs took advantage of this.

The subjects of this disease pretended to be unconscious of their actions; to be unable to refrain from leaping, running, dancing, &c. They also saw visions and heard voices from the invisible world. One of these visions, seen by many, was the ancestors of the King, and the voices they heard announced the coming of these ancestors to tell the King what he was to do for the good of the country. Subsequently a message was brought to him as from his ancestors, to the effect that, if he did not stop \'the praying,\' some great calamity would soon befall him. To the surprise of his best friends, the King was exceedingly interested in this strange movement, seemed to believe the pretended message from the world of spirits, and encouraged the frantic dancers, who daily thronged his house, and declared that the disease would continue to increase till \'the praying\' was stopped. It is generally reported that these movements were prompted by the guardians of the idols, and promoted by his own Mena maso,* who bribed parties to come as sick persons in large numbers from the country, in order to continue the delusion.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1863#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'FRENCH CLAIMS ON MADAGASCAR.

The testimony on this subject is so strong as to be absolutely conclusive. The facts, indeed, are not denied by the French Government, who will probably contend that what the planters require is simply the organization of free African labour on the indentureship system. Experience in Réunion has shown that it is impossible to secure adequate protection to imported labourers, even when the British Government, acting diplomatically as well as through its resident agents, did its best to induce the local authorities to see that justice was done. But even if the Administration in Réunion could be trusted, it would be impossible so to control the so-called immigration from Africa as to prevent it from becoming a branch of the slave-trade. Africa does not suffer from pressure of population, and there is no natural desire on the part of the people to emigrate to distant countries. At the same time, if the French determine to introduce African engagés into Réunion, the supply of labourers is certain to be equal to the demand, but this will only be by the unscrupulous action of slave-traders eager for a new and profitable market. It is said that large numbers of Sakalavas have been taken to Réunion from the North-west coast of Madagascar, but that, although a good deal has been said as to the voluntary nature of the contracts and the limited period during which the engaged labourers were to be absent from their homes, not one of them has ever been known to return. There is reason to believe that the recent proceedings of the French in Madagascar are attributable not so much to a restless spirit of aggression on the part of the French Government as to the intrigues of colonial planters, who think that under cover of the national flag they may draw a perennial supply of servile labour from the western coast of the great African island. It is satisfactory to learn that the attention of the anti-slavery party in France is being directed to this subject, and that they have resolved strenuously to oppose the revival of a system which, if sanctioned by the Government, cannot fail to bring discredit upon the Republic.""

Imported labour of some kind those planters must and will have, and the seaport and the Madagascar protectorate have, we think and believe, been put forward by those plantation interests with a view to the importation of African slaves.

With the view, also, of shielding the perpetrators of the intended murders, the King announced his intention to issue an order, or law, that any person or persons wishing to fight with fire-arms, swords, or spears, should not be prevented, and that if any one were killed the murderer should not be punished.

Twenty thousand representatives have declared that Madagascar shall not, without a desperate struggle, be subordinated to French rule. The vast arena of Andohalo—the public meeting-place of Antananarivo—presented the appearance of an amphitheatre. On every side huge multitudes stood, listening to the statement of the Prime Minister that M. Le Myre de Vilers has presented such demands to the Malagasy Government as would, if yielded to, for ever make the Malagasy the dependents of France. ""Has the Government been right in rejecting the demands?"" his Excellency asked, as he finished his speech on the French ultimatum. And in answer to the inquiry, there went up a shout of derision at the French demands. There was no doubt left that ""the heart of a people beat with one desire."" Then the national indignation broke through the desire for peace, and a torrent of eloquence rushed from the mouths of scores of orators. The ""love of peace that was full of wrongs and shames"" was over and done. But there was no wish for war. Only a determination to face that alternative, should France assail the independence of the Malagasy.\n\nWe British dwelling among this people believe that the British Government will not exercise every resource which diplomacy admits to attain a revision of an Anglo-French Convention.\n\nThe Europeans in the interior are pursuing their usual vocations; indeed, there is no need for a feeling of uneasiness. The Prime Minister recently received a deputation from them with the greatest cordiality, dwelling affectionately upon the good-will between the British and Norwegians, and the Malagasy.

The first is the long stretch of east coast from Antongil Bay to Fort Dauphin, forming almost a straight line. It contains not a single really good natural harbour, nor a decently navigable river of any length, and most of its towns are only approached by dangerous roadsteads. From its geographical position it will easily be understood that its foreign element are mostly Mauritians. The natural resources of this coast have been to a great extent exhausted, and the prospects now lie principally in sugar-planting. The Mauritians are naturally acquainted with this industry, and there is a great future before them. Coffee is also a profitable undertaking, but it must not be planted at a lower elevation than 1,500 feet above the level of the sea. Spices of almost every kind can also be cultivated auxiliary to the sugar plantations. The second division is that called the North-east Coast, being that part between Antongil Bay and Cape Amber. It contains two or three harbours, but not very good ones. The forests here are much larger than in any other part, and consequently the natural supplies of India-rubber and gum-copal are still plentiful. This is the most thinly populated part of the island, but exceedingly fertile. Probably in a few more years the natural resources will be exhausted, and foreign residents will then have recourse to agriculture, with better results perhaps than can be obtained on any other part of the East Coast. The third division of the Coast is the North-west, from Cape Amber to Cape St. Andrew, and the part coveted by France. This part contains lignite deposits and valuable woods, and is full of good harbours. Its foreign element consists chiefly of Indians and Muslims, and a few French Creoles. The fourth division is the West Coast, properly called—i.e., from Cape St. Andrew North to St. Augustine South. Full of good harbours and navigable rivers, it is probably the finest part of Madagascar. The foreigners there are mostly Americans and Englishmen, who carry on a trade with the Cape and Natal. The fifth part is the Southern portion, from St. Augustine to Fort Dauphin, about which nothing is really known.\n\nIt will be seen, then, how little is yet known of the vast commercial resources of this island, and of the number of industries that may be opened. The trade of the last few months has been characterised by a little more activity, but at best can only be said to be very slack. The coast merchants are still prevented from exporting such articles as would afford supplies to the French armies, or were prevented up to a very short time ago.

A young engineer, hot and tired from his day\'s work, drank at dinner a large quantity of Portuguese wine. A severe attack of dysentery followed, and when convalescent, though still weak, he was sent to the coast on his way home, with the most solemn warnings not to touch strong drinks. Yet, while waiting for the steamer, he sold his coat for a bottle of gin, and twelve hours later he was in his grave. Another engineer somehow obtained possession of a bottle of brandy at lunch, and was shortly afterwards found dead with the bottle under his head. ""Strong drink on the Congo,"" added Mr. Stanley, ""means death.""\n\nLeaving this melancholy phase of the subject, I asked, ""What do you expect will be the immediate effect of the Congo Railway?""\n\n""It will alter the entire aspect of everything,"" answered Mr. Stanley. ""It will give new life to the State, and introduce civilization into the heart of Africa very rapidly indeed. At present there are some thousands of native traders at Stanley Pool, and there are European traders at the head of the navigation of the Lower Congo, so close to the cataracts that they can hear their roar; yet the two cannot come together on account of these cataracts, which form a gap 235 miles long. This gap can only be bridged by the native carriers, who are all absorbed in the transport of some 1,200 tons of merchandise in the year. While this state of things lasts progress is impossible. These 1,200 tons now being transported on the heads and backs of the carriers would be a mere drop in the ocean, compared with the goodly trade that would be going up the Congo if the native traders could be supplied with a sufficient quantity of goods.""\n\n""This, then, is probably one reason of the excessive dearness of ivory, which threatens soon to become worth nearly its weight in gold?""\n\n""It is the only reason.

The native traders are willing and eager to search for these precious articles; but if they all rushed up the affluents of the Congo to fetch goods, they might be years in getting rid of them. Thus you may see how great an impetus commerce will receive from the construction of the railway. As soon as the natives have gathered all the ivory from their own resorts, they will be urged by the demand for more to proceed still further into the interior, taking with them the worth of their goods in the produce of English industry.""\n\n""Then you think, Mr. Stanley, that one of the earliest results to be expected from the railway would be the cheapening of ivory?""', 'last_edit_date': '1886-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1886#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.622, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

This is a question that has so far not been seriously considered by historians, African or European, but it needs to be answered. The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy. Asante must remain as of old at the same time to remain friendly with all white men. I do not write this in a boastful spirit but in the clear sense of its meaning ... the cause of Asante is progressing and there is no reason for any Asante man to feel alarm at the prospects or to believe for a single instant that our cause has been driven back by the events of the past hostilities. 2\nIn 1895, Wobogo, the Moro Naba, or King of the Mossi (in modern Upper Volta), told the French officer, Captain Destenave: I know that the whites wish to kill me in order to take my country, and yet you claim that they will help me to organize my country. But I find my country good just as it is. I have no need of them.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The most important and most discussed African component was the local chief. Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.631, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Only few of the colonial administrators seemed to have understood how to manage the uneasy relationship which existed between the 'traditional' and the new African elites on the one hand, and between these two sets of elites and the colonial regimes on the other. The few exceptions included, notably, General (later Marshal) Lyautey in Morocco, Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard in Northern Nigeria and Sir Gordon Guggisberg in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

On the other hand, we have no evidence confirming the presence of Gonja or Dagomba contingents in the Asante army or of payment by these countries of the Asante war tax (apeatoo). The settlement of the Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes must therefore be considered as a political act with economic motives: peace in these territories guaranteed payment of the tribute, as well as the introduction of Asante institutions into the Dagomba army.

Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief.

His primary function, he asserted unequivocally, 'is to act as a chief.$^{19}$ The reserved and unobtrusive role which Lugard had hoped the British Resident would generally play in Northern Nigeria was denied in their territories by the French and Portuguese administrators, both sets of whom were prominent in the exercise of local authority.

There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The expression of African nationalism and politics', 'content': ""Much as the colonial and the general international environment were broadly the same, the actual expression of African nationalism and politics, phenomena neatly summed up by the Swahili word siasa, varied from place to place, even in territories under the same imperial master. The explanation for this lies partly in the fact that colonial territories were acquired in different ways, at different points in time, and therefore had different experiences of colonialism, lasting for varied lengths of time. Factors which conditioned the form and intensity of action by nationalists (wanasiasa) in the colonies included the type of leadership, the variations in the spread and intensity of European influences in the form of ideas and institutions; the number and significance of the settler (white) population; and, lastly, the colonial ideologies and practices.\nIn nearly all cases, the nationalist movements and the attendant colonial politics were led and dominated by the new western-educated elites who were the best equipped to understand the European political culture and therefore to react effectively to the colonial regimes on the terms enunciated by the latter.

Maclean, President of the Council of Merchants that provided the local administration of the forts, could therefore give free reign to his business acumen and knowledge of people, often disregarding official instructions from London, where a committee of merchants once again had charge of the forts. He had a twofold objective: to keep Asante at bay and to bring the coastal peoples under his control. He therefore had a tripartite FanteBritish-Asante treaty signed whereby the parties recognized the inde› pendence of the coastal countries south of the Pra river, agreed to bring any conflict before the British party and undertook to keep trade routes open. Maclean tried gradually to acquaint the Fante with English legal principles through a hierarchy of courts ranging from the chiefs' courts to those over which he himself presided. Local militias posted at the chiefs' courts helped to apply the new laws, whilst the introduction of cowries for minor transactions and the encouragement of the production of palm oil started to change the economic structure.\nHowever, the British government decided to resume direct control of the coastal settlements in 1843 and to govern them by a legal convention among the chiefs recognizing British law (the Bond of 1844).$^{4}$ In 1858 the administration of the Gold Coast, which, apart from the forts, was a protectorate rather than a colony, was separated from Sierra Leone.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': ""However, the movement gained momentum, inspired by African intel› lectuals whom the Colonial Office described even in 1855 as a half-civilized intermediary class with ideas acquired from missionaries and others.

Only by uniting will you gain access to your rights'. Such were the ideas of James Africanus Horton, a Sierra Leonean, Joseph Smith, Henry Barnes, T. Hughes, F. L. Grant and R. J. Ghartey. Under the circumstances the coastal chiefs were very open to such arguments. They dreaded being attacked again by the Asante and were determined to contribute to their own defence, but they disapproved of the flabby attitude of the Dutch to Kumasi and its coastal ally, Elmina. They therefore opposed the exchange of forts that the British contemplated with the Dutch in order to make their respective territories homogeneous. However, they were also afraid of being abandoned by the British, who pressed them to unite against Asante in defence of the coast, but did not intend to give them the means to do so.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration.

It says that ""King Tackie and Assaf Ajaye had been plotting to bring about another war with Ashanti."" The writer ought to have told your readers how King Tackie was to make war against anybody, where his troops are, and what means he has of arming and maintaining them if he had them. ""At length, after repeated warnings,"" &c. What warnings? Did the Governor go to them, or send for them? If he wrote to them, where is the letter? If he sent to them, who was the messenger? But ""a report was circulated that the rough element of Accra intended to attempt a rescue at night,"" is truly amazing. No Governor could have believed any such report, and especially the late Governor, who knew the Accras much too well to have given credence to such nonsense. The first heard of anything wrong was that the King was in the fort, and the people were patiently waiting to hear him brought to trial; but without trial, without examination before a magistrate, he was deported to Elmina. The only feeling in Accra is indignation that any one can be imprisoned on a lettre de cachet. The man was sent for by the District Commissioner as if to speak to him, and then informed that he had just received a letter from the Governor, ordering him (the King) to be imprisoned. The ""goings on"" of late years have been so extraordinary that they must be impossible anywhere but on the Gold Coast, where the officials find they are irresponsible. How, and with what, were the Accras to attack and take the fort or the castle? Either this poor man has been thus treated for some personal ill-will against him, or the mere accusation of an informer has been of sufficient weight to crush all pretence to decency. Had the accused been brought to open trial, confronted with his accuser (but the confronting is carefully avoided), and fairly convicted, and had appeal been made to the people, ""see what your chief has been doing,"" they would themselves have taken him off the stool for attempting any such thing without their consent, as he has no right to do anything without consulting the people. It very conveniently answers a certain purpose to pretend that the kings are despotic; they have no such power. Accra is a republic, and no chief can hear any message, deliver any answer, send a message, make any law, or do anything whatever affecting the general public, except in open meeting, when any one may give his opinion as freely as any chief. It is equally a farce, invented and kept up within the last four or five years, to make it appear that the constant presence of ships of war (sometimes four) is necessary for the protection of our protectors; it answered its purpose once, and is kept up in expectation of some one being able to make capital of it again. The whole thing is nonsense, and utterly disgraceful.

Everyone knows the Ashantis to be a treacherous lot of people; that they do not rashly pledge themselves to anything, and when they do, they have ulterior designs; and how the Government could have been induced to place any confidence in his Majesty of Ashanti, so as to compel our people from time to time to give up their prisoners, and fine and disgrace our kings and chiefs, on representations coming from such a source, is more than any sane man out here can understand. For him, and to suit him, and to oblige and to calm him, our border kings and chiefs were almost invariably maltreated. One can hardly find fault with the Government for this, as there was someone who was perpetually pouring into their ears stories of outrages committed on peaceable Ashanti traders, insults offered to his Majesty, and anything that would lead the Government to believe that we are and were always the provoking and aggressing party in all disturbances with the Ashantis.

There appears to be some foundation for believing that a military expedition has been sent to Coomassie, or is about to be, for the purposes of compelling the King of Ashanti to accept a British Resident at his capital, whether the same be just, expedient, or otherwise. It is but fair (and Englishmen always boast of their fairness) that our Government and the King of Ashanti should have the like opportunities of putting their case before the British public, although I am aware that the public Press is not exactly the constitutional medium generally appealed to. The Ambassadors, however, are in London, and having appealed to the Government for a hearing (which has been refused), they can but now appeal to the Press for the ventilation of their alleged grievances—the more especially as I understand that the British Government are not slow on occasions to recognise that as a correct medium. According to my instructions, it would appear that Prempeh was not elected to the stool of Ashanti by us, so much so that we refused to interfere with the Ashantees\' selection at all, but fully recognised their action by having present our official representative at the coronation, and acknowledged him as King of Ashanti. There cannot be any manner of doubt about this, as it is borne out by the Blue records from 1888 to 1894. I am also told that when the British Government submitted the proposal that a British Resident should be received, the King was correctly designated by us as ""King of Ashanti,"" although at that time we were aware of the fact now alleged that ""the old Ashanti Confederation"" has been broken up""—a confederation which, I am instructed, had never existed. My clients emphatically deny that the King has ever broken or violated any of his treaty engagements. They deny, too, that he has countenanced human sacrifice, a fact which I am told is negatived by our own records; nor has he, it is urged, hampered trade and attacked tribes under British protection. It is also denied that he has raided for slaves. On the contrary, my clients inform me that the King has cause to complain of want of frankness towards him, and that our representative in the Gold Coast, while professing friendship towards the King, has, as a fact, been acting contrary to his pledges. The King is prepared to open his country to British skill, and does not seek to hamper trade as is suggested. The Ambassadors submit that the fact of Ashanti being ""within the sphere of British influence"" does not carry away the King\'s independence as a sovereign, nor justify the hostile attitude our Government are assuming. That the King is an independent sovereign, there cannot be any question in the face of the reply of the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, given in February last, and if England claims the right to send a mission to the King whenever she feels inclined, my clients urge that the same privilege should be extended to their King when he is acting with bona fides and in the honest belief that he is acting within his rights. The mission have travelled some thousands of miles to discuss the position and treat with her Majesty\'s advisers, and if only on the grounds of fair play, and apart from any precedent, the Government could receive them, there certainly would not be any particle of reason why one ounce of blood should be shed.

We had no cause to complain of our reception by Colonel Harley. He very kindly listened to what we had to say, but, somehow or other, he would not believe that the Ashantis were in very large force, and appeared, therefore, somewhat reluctant to give assistance in arms and ammunition proportionate to the emergency. During our discussion, however, Mr. Amissah stated to the Administrator that our peoples were determined, since they had not provoked this war, if they were successful in driving off the enemy, to follow him up to Coomassie, and make a final blow at the Ashanti power, provided we were assisted by the Government. This Colonel Harley construed into treasonable language, refused to listen to an explanation, and Mr. Amissah was therefore politely requested to make his exit. I need not say how much I was taken aback at this, and I believe that Mr. Cleaver could not have been less so; for Mr. Amissah is the last person from whom one would be likely to hear treasonable language, and if he cared about talking treason, it is not to be expected that he would do so in the presence of so august a personage.

The mission of these Envoys marks a stage in a series of negotiations. They are six in number, the chief amongst them being Prince A. A. Ossoo-Ansah, a son of Prince Ansah, who, in 1874, after the Ashanti War and the deposition of King Coffee, visited England for the purpose of clearing himself of imputations as to disloyalty to England during that war, and of obtaining compensation for the destruction of his property by the enemy. Prince Ossoo Ansah is the only one of the six who can speak English, and is appointed to act as interpreter and spokesman. The purpose of the visit has been stated in telegraphic despatches, but some fuller information is now available. It seems that the relations of Great Britain towards Ashanti have, with the sanction of the French Government, assumed somewhat new features, as it has been recognised as falling within the British sphere of influence. With the increased assurance of protection thus afforded, British traders have extended their operations in the country, which is extremely fertile in general produce, and especially rich in gold. The Governor of Cape Coast Castle, Sir W. Brandford Griffith, has consequently been led to propose the extension of British authority in a more formal manner—the establishment of a British Resident at the capital, Coomassie (or Kumasi). This step having been taken, the next would naturally be the definite conversion of the country into a British Protectorate. But to this idea a considerable number of the Natives have expressed the most decided objection; and it is with the idea of expressing the popular feeling upon this point that these six ""ambassadors"" have been appointed with the intention that they should seek an interview with the Queen, and lay before her Majesty the reasons why such a course would be so unpopular among their people.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-05-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_05_1895#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Chiefs and Kings of the Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—The interest which your journal has always taken in the affairs of West Africa induces me to solicit a space for the insertion of this article, which I trust will not fail to lead to an amelioration of the state of things, by its being brought to the knowledge of those whom it concerns.\n\nOne of the results of the Ashanti Campaign was to bring the countries on the Gold Coast under the control or protection of the British Government. The countries on the sea-coast are divided into districts, to each of which a Commissioner is appointed by the Governor. The interior countries, however, are not thus provided for, but are left to be ruled by their chiefs and kings, as formerly. The authority of these kings and chiefs was not formally acknowledged, and any offence which, according to custom, is visited with severe punishment, is immediately reported to the Government authorities on the sea-coast; and the chieftain or king who ordered the punishment is brought before the Court and treated as the commonest fellow.\n\nThis action on the part of the Government terrifies and paralyzes a good many of these chiefs and kings, so that in a great many instances the wicked go unpunished. On the other hand, others use the name of the Government to acquire territories which they have not the least right to. Amongst these I may mention the name of one ""Sakiaty,"" who is of great notoriety in Eastern Croboe, interior of Accra. This man was a chief of Odumase, a country of Eastern Croboe, before the Ashanti Campaign, but immediately after the war, he assumed the authority and title of king, which he said was vested in him by Sir John Glover for the valuable services he rendered in the war. Not contented with the throne which he has thus usurped, he is now intriguing to acquire Western Croboe also. The present king of Western Croboe, who is now being molested, forbears to say anything, lest his opposition may end in a contest, and he may be thereby brought to the sea-coast and treated with ignominy. But there is sure to come a successor who will dispute every inch of ground that ""Sakiaty"" has thus acquired. This will undoubtedly end in strife, when people will have the mortification again to see that their royalties are treated contemptuously by those who are their protectors. If the present system of government in the interior countries is to continue, I would, Sir, respectfully recommend that the following plans be carried out: (1) that every chieftain or king in the interior should prove his claim; (2) that the right of government by native chiefs and kings in the interior, so far as it is compatible with common sense and humanity, be proclaimed as supported by the British authorities on the sea-coast; and (3), that any unnecessary interference and aggression of one chief or king with another, be met with the highest displeasure of the Governor.', 'last_edit_date': '1880-06-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_08_1880#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Colonial Office and the Ashanti Envoys', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Ashanti envoys who persisted in coming to England some months ago with the forlorn hope of being officially received as the accredited representatives of the Ashanti King, have now returned to their own country, without securing the object for which they had travelled so far.

It was always understood that the Ashantees were busy accumulating ammunition, and the Dutch withdrawal and Elmina discontent, brought the slumbering hostilities to a head again. It is not difficult to prove that it was our duty to rid the Protectorate of them. The only error was, that that was not understood at the commencement, before they half-ruined the country and bearded us in our seacoast forts. It being our duty to get rid of them, it must have been equally our duty to get rid of them effectually. This could only be done by what has since been done—by following them into their own territory, destroying their military prestige, burning their capital, and shattering the power ""of the only negro State which offered any semblance of a stable government."" Detestable government, might well have been said. As to what we hope to gain by peace and friendship with them, after the measures we have taken for their destruction, the reply is not difficult. Having gained a full assurance of peace for the Protectorate, by destroying the military prestige and power of its only enemy, we give that humbled enemy liberty to carry on, as heretofore, that trade with the sea-coast without which he cannot live; and which he could not have ventured on without a treaty, because the Assins, Wassaws, Denkeras, &c., would have murdered and plundered the traders, on the ground of their being still enemies. The Ashantees, and the people of their formerly tributary states and others beyond, cannot exist without communication with the Coast, for that most indispensable article, salt, and many others. We wish them to have these; we have an advantage in their coming to buy them in our territory: we guarantee them, by treaty, peaceable access, on certain terms. This will give them again their old advantages as intermediate traders between the seacoast and the people beyond. In the supposition that there is an engagement on the part of the King of Ashanti that there shall be no more human sacrifices, this is sneered at as having ""a shining moral appearance."" When we reflect on the myriads of human beings that have been offered there in sacrifice, until the whole atmosphere of the capital was poisoned by the sickly exhalation from human gore and putrefying carcases, we feel ineffable disgust at this ""shining moral appearance."" If no other good end had been obtained by us, this one alone, if obtained, is worthy of a great Christian civilized nation; and, should be deemed, if power has duties as well as rights, a full and exceeding recompense for the effort we have made, even though the ""sacrifice of other lives which it has entailed"" should all be debited to this account, which we deny. As to the war ""having been always unnecessary,"" we have not space to join issue on the point as it deserves. All we shall say is, it can only be deemed unnecessary, provided it could be established that, if earlier measures had been taken by the Cape Coast Government to aid the native tribes of the Protectorate, they alone would have sufficed for rolling back the invasion. We always believed this might have been effected. But even then the war could scarcely be deemed unnecessary, as the territories would have been continually threatened with invasion and devastation, murder, and all other enormities of barbarian inroads. There was no permanent remedy to be found, no permanent security to be obtained, save by the invasion of Ashanti. This has been, happily, accomplished, and however party feeling may suffer at the too speedy and economical success, we rejoice that there is no longer any probability of our ever having again to deplore an Ashanti invasion of the Gold Coast.', 'last_edit_date': '1874-03-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/28_03_1874#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ASHANTI PEACE NEGOTIATIONS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""A meeting of Ashanti ambassadors was held at Palaver Hall, Cape Coast Castle, on Tuesday, the 14th March, 1871.

These different movements joined forces to recall and defend France's 'historic rights' over Madagascar. That claim, which had its roots in the memory of the annexation proclaimed under Louis XIV and of the fruitless attempts made in the eighteenth century to set up a prosperous France Orientale, based on the trading posts established in the eighteenth century and under the Restoration, was developed throughout the nineteenth century in a large number of written documents before being put to the French parliament officially in 1884. The RØunion lobby demanded the complete conquest of the island, so that the overflow of Reunion's Creole population could be settled there and the abundant resources which the British seemed likely to exploit could be reserved for their own use. French Catholic missionaries in Madagascar, for their part, were reduced to evangelizing the lower social classes since most of the noble families and the rich and powerful commoners had been converted to Protestantism. Consequently they demanded official support from France in their bid to overcome the competition of the Protestants, whom they portrayed as being a product of the innumerable 'underhand dealings' of the British. This 'perfidious Albion' theory found a favourable echo in certain business circles which, in an endeavour to conquer the Malagasy market at the expense of the British and Americans, sought to debar the latter by annexing the island rather than by reducing the prices of their own goods. Colonial propaganda appealed to people's chauvinistic sentiments and the belief in France's humanitarian and civilizing mission. In order to prime public opinion for the conquest, th*; 'Kingdom of Madagascar' was presented, in blatant bad faith, as being a 'barbarous state', headed by a 'foreign tribe' which had exalted 'tyranny as a system of government' and still engaged in the slave trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.612, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'The events that marked the real turning point, however, were the formal annexation of Lagos to the British Crown in 1861 and a British naval action against Porto Novo later the same year.$^{34}$ These two British actions naturally sensitized the French, who had considerable commercial interests in Whydah and Porto Novo. Encouraged by Porto Novo itself, a French protectorate was declared over this coastal Aja state in 1863 to check further British advance along the coast to the west.

This involvement of both Britain and France in the trade and politics of Lagos and Porto Novo respectively sparked off a spell of dramatic rivalry between the two powers in a bid to control Yorubaland, especially the western parts, and the adjacent Aja-speaking communities.

The foremost exponents of this view, Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher, who stress the strategic importance of Africa to India for Britain, blame the partition of Africa on the impact of atavistic \'protonationalist\' movements in Africa which threatened the global strategic interests of European nations. These \'romantic, reactionary struggles\' gallant anachronisms in their view - compelled reluctant European states› men, hitherto content to exercise informal paramountcy and moral suasion in Africa, to partition and conquer the continent. Africa was occupied, therefore, not because of what it could offer materially to the Europeans for it was economically worthless - but because it was threatening European interests elsewhere. 18 One primary aim of the psychological theories as well as of their cousins, the diplomatic theories, has been to debunk the notion that the partition of Africa was motivated by economic impulses. But the prestige argument only appears unconvincing when its economic concomitant is eliminated or unduly played down. Hayes, for example, has documented in detail the tariff war which took place between the European nations during the crucial period of the partition. \'$^{9}$ He even concedes that, \'What actually started the economic push into the ""Dark Continent"" and the sun-baked islands of the Pacific was not so much an overproduction of factory goods in Europe as an under-supply of raw materials\';$^{20}$ and that therefore \'to prevent too much of the world from being ... monopolized by France, Germany, Italy, or any other protectionist power, Great Britain moved mightily to gather the lion\'s share into her own free-trade empire\'. In other words, neomercantilism, once established, had very important consequences for the emergence of imperial rivalries.$^{21}$ And yet, on the very next page, Hayes sets out to argue confidently, as we have seen, against the economic under› pinnings of the new imperialism. H. Brunschwig, too, while positing a non-economic interpretation of French imperialism was faced with the stark economic dimension of empire, and was thus compelled to assign it some role.

The issue at stake was whether they were entitled to own the land they worked or could at least expect to obtain a long-term leasehold on it. 7\nIn April 1881, relations between France and Madagascar became even more acrimonious over the ToalØ affair. The ToalØ was a dhow whose owner - an Arab but a French subject - together with three other Muslim members of the crew, were murdered by the men of the Sakalava king, Bakary, in the bay of Marambitsy, an area outside the control of the Merina authorities. These people, who were gunrunners, had been verbally challenged and ordered to hand over their cargo; instead, they opened fire on the Sakalava, who fired back and killed them. The French claimed reparation from the Queen of Madagascar for this smuggling incident. 8"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.59, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Madagascar, 1880S-1930S: African initiatives and reaction to colonial conquest and domination', 'section_title': 'A country united by its submission to France and its opposition to colonial domination > From colonization to the dawning of the national movement', 'content': ""For the Malagasy people, the colonial situation meant that they had lost their freedom and dignity.

France decided to 'civilize' the Malagasy people and 'assimilate' them, and hence to compel them to become something else or, in other words, to alienate them.

Victor Augagneur, his successor, saw the reasons as lying in the 'surfeit of administration' (increased taxation, abuses in tax collection, and the tyrannical attitude of heads of military posts or isolated settlers). These explanations were inadequate, since they overlooked an essential aspect of the insurrection (the struggle for the recovery of freedom) and the organizational ability of the insurgents, who attacked all those who personified the colonial administration, whether they were French occupying forces or Malagasy civil servants or schoolteachers. By way of conclusion to his study of the 1904 rebellion, G. Jacob states that it undoubtedly had a twofold significance: 'it was a fight for independence and a struggle against colonial exploitation'.$^{26}$ The suppression of this first revolt against the oppression of the administration forced the Malagasy to seek other forms of struggle.\nOne of the most widespread forms of anti-colonial response was passive resistance: a refusal to comply with orders; the rejection of everything that was regarded as a sign of 'civilization' but was closely bound up with colonization and the foreign presence; keeping children away from school, which was looked upon in some circles as merely being a form of 'colonial forced labour'; and abandonment of the villages created along the roads in the south in an attempt to keep the population together. These refusals to co-operate did not seem dangerous to the colonizers, who believed that peace had finally been established in Madagascar in 1905. But then, suddenly, in 1915, the revolt of the Sadiavahe the nickname given to the insurgents - broke out in the south-west, while in Antananarivo the police discovered the existence of a secret society known as Vy Vato Sakelika or VVS - 'strong and hard like stone and iron' (see Fig. 10.3)."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.583, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Madagascar, 1880S-1930S: African initiatives and reaction to colonial conquest and domination', 'section_title': 'A country united by its submission to France and its opposition to colonial domination > Struggles to recover dignity', 'content': 'The decade following the First World War was an important period because of the growing awareness displayed throughout the country in the prepara› tion and consolidation of a national movement.

This is what happened in the Kenädza area and at Shinkït.\nHaving always refused to define the frontier with Morocco beyond Figuig, France pursued a policy of slowly nibbling away at territory. Working their way up the valley of the Sawra, her forces gradually occupied the territory between Wâdï Gïr and Wâdï Züsfänä, on the pretext of ending lawlessness and insecurity and allowing frontier trade to expand.

Less complacently, one of the Moroccan contributors to the review wrote: 'In our country we are ready to grant the Berbers what is generally refused to the Bretons in France.

It appears that Captain Grant Elliott, who is the representative of the Belgian Association, in the administration of the Kwilu and Niari districts, was absent recently when the agents of the Dutch and German houses called at his station for assistance against a threatened native attack on the Mpila river. A party of police in the service of the Belgian Association, under the command of M. Hodister, promptly rendered assistance, and the threatened attack was averted. The French commander at Loango claimed the Mpila river as French property, and arrested the member of the Dutch house for making war on French territory. M. Hamel, representative of the Dutch factory, was stated to have been knocked down, bound with ropes, and treated in a brutal manner by the French Senegalese soldiers. On Captain Elliott's return, he demanded the release of M. Hamel, on the ground that the Mpila river was under his administration, but his demand appears to have been refused. The French frigate Le Second arrived at Loango on Oct. 24, and peremptorily ordered that M. Hodister, who commanded the police force which went to the assistance of the Dutch house, should be given up and taken to Gaboon, to be tried by the French Governor-General. With this demand Captain Elliott declined to comply, and upon its becoming known that the Association officers were fortifying their stations at Grantville, great excitement prevailed, especially among the natives, who offered assistance to Captain Elliott, which he, however, declined. The demand for M. Hodister to be given up was repeated by the commandant, and again refused by Captain Elliott. The French frigate then left for Gaboon. It seems that the French accused M. Hodister of having broken his *parole d'honneur*, but upon Captain Elliott asking for an explanation, the accusation was frankly withdrawn. After this, Captain Elliott proceeded to Gaboon, in order, it is believed, to place the whole question before the Governor-General. Personally, the relations between the French and the Association officers are very friendly and cordial, the French naval authorities having placed their ships at the disposal of the Association officers whenever a passage is required from one port to another, and it is, therefore, hoped that the unpleasantness which has arisen will be satisfactorily settled. M. Frontaine, the head of the Dutch house at Banana, had arrived at the Kwila river, and expressed surprise that only the members of his factories had been molested by the French, while the representatives of the German house, who accompanied Major Hodister to the Mpila river on the occasion, had not been interfered with.

It would be impossible, we think, for even the most unreasoning admirer of France, its people, and its Government, to find cause for eulogy in the late external action of the Paris cabinet. With Annam and Tonquin we have nothing to do, though we may have formed our opinions on the subject. As regards Madagascar, we consider the French action, prompted by the Réunion planters, as so certain to lead, if successful, to a new revival of the African slave trade, either open or under the pretence of apprenticeship, or free labour contracts, that, as such, and as a wanton aggression on a community of the African race that has been for some time steadily progressing on the road to civilization, we do not hesitate to give it our most emphatic condemnation. The Government of Liberia, like that of Madagascar, refuses to allow white men to obtain a settlement on any portion of its land by purchase; and although this has greatly interfered with the development of the resources of the country, by shutting out European capital and energy, we can find quite enough in the history of past relations of Europeans with the people of Africa to excuse this policy of isolation. Behind every European acquiring, by purchase, landed possessions in such a country, there looms the national government of that European in the distance, as almost certain to become a factor in any dispute that might arise between him and the authorities. With equal justice, therefore, might France make demands upon Liberia, as upon Madagascar, on the ground of refusal to allow French subjects to become freeholders. What most concerns us, however, as regards the present external action of the French Government, is that portion of it which embraces west and south-west Africa in its disturbing course. We have before alluded to and condemned (and it will bear repetition) the most unfriendly action of France in taking the wretched King Tofa, of Porto Novo, under its protection. We repeat, situate as Porto Novo is with regard to Lagos, together with the non-existence of any real French interest there, the acceptance of a Protectorate by France was about as offensively unfriendly an action as can well be conceived. The French mercantile house that counselled it, has performed about as questionable service to France as was performed by the Portuguese slave trader who led the French Government into a similar measure some twenty years ago. No good can come of it to France, and much evil may. We and all other advocates of the rights of humanity, must now hold her responsible for all the horrors it may please her atrocious protege, King Tofa, to commit. We have a right to demand, in the interests of humanity and civilization, that the French Protectorate of Porto Novo shall be characterized and justified by the absolute repression of those fearful customs in which it has pleased King Tofa and his predecessors to indulge. Such repression has characterized the action of Great Britain in West Africa, and the way in which she has thus exercised her power for freeing the poor wretched victims of tyranny and superstition constitute, in our mind, her only just claim to rule there. Her keeping peace among the natives, and suppressing all slavery and slave trade, so far as within her power; affording protection to trade and commerce, and laying the foundation of civilization on which the natives may hereafter build—these, we say, and to afford protection for philanthropic and missionary enterprise, are her raison d\'etre, on the West Coast. There is no doubt—there can be no doubt—that she might do this work better than she does, if more enlightened councils prevailed in Downing Street; still, what she has done, has been greatly instrumental for good. To feel this fully we have only to imagine what the West Coast of Africa would have been without persistent British interference and guardianship there. And it must always be borne in mind that the imperial exchequer does not receive one farthing from her settlements and possessions, and the protected trade there; while under her liberal free trade system, the ships, subjects, and goods of every other civilized power, European or American, have the same advantages as her own. In a word, she keeps the greater portion of West Africa open to trade and commerce for the benefit of the whole world. Now, the French Colonial system is the very reverse of this. Her protective and prohibitive regulations are in full force at Goree and Senegal; and, by intelligence lately received, we can have no doubt that France is anxious to confer similar benefits on other portions of the West Coast. The French admiral who took Porto Novo under French protection, looked in upon other places on his way down the coast. He made overtures to the King of Bonny, which the king and chief, who have received education in England, were too wise to listen to. And now we learn further that he has proposed to establish a French factory at Old Calabar, and that King Duke Ephraim IX., whose coronation under the auspices of the British consul and the Rev. W. Anderson, we some time since gave an account of, has held a grand council and petitioned the French Government to induce French traders to settle there. Those who do not know anything of the West Coast would suppose from this that French traders were hitherto denied trade with Old Calabar; which, under British consular auspices, has been open for trade to all the world from the period at which Great Britain put a final end to the slave trade there. The intended process is clear. A French factory under Government auspices, perhaps managed by Messrs. Regis, of Marseilles, Lagos, and Porto Novo, who have manipulated the Porto Novo protectorate—a dispute with the natives—French Government demands redress—protection—occupation—a French exclusive trading station, to the exclusion of our Liverpool and German merchants, who now do the great oil trade there.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1883#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.613, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'FRANCE AND MADAGASCAR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Malagasy Government has lately published the official correspondence between its Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Consuls of France. A more shameful story of arrogance and high-handed wrong-doing on the part of a first-rate European Power has been seldom given to the world. The first dispute, it seems, arose over the sale of land by the heirs of a former French Consul to a Roman Catholic priest. The Hova Government objected to the sale because the Consul in question, by Malagasy law, which prohibits the owning of land by foreigners, was only a life tenant. Moreover, the title-deeds which the Hova Government declare to have been forged, bore the signature of King Radama II., dated several months after that monarch\'s death. The French Consul attempted to explain this unpleasant fact away by different reckonings of the calendar, but the Hovas are able to prove that not a single document of Radama II.\'s reign bears the date of 1864 except the particular one in dispute. The second dispute arose over the death of four French sailors on the coast. These men were, from the Malagasy standpoint, nothing more nor less than smugglers, who were landing weapons of war and ammunition, contrary to treaty. A Malagasy chief endeavoured to stop this traffic, and was fired upon by the French smugglers, whereupon the fire was returned, with the result that four of the French were killed and the goods in question seized. In the end the Hova Government paid an indemnity under protest. The trumped-up claim of the French to a Protectorate over the North-west Coast rests upon an alleged transfer of power by a certain chief to the French; but, apart from the fact that this man, as a vassal, had no right to alienate lands, the treaty which he did sign only allowed the French to settle for agricultural and commercial purposes, and to keep some armed men ""for their own protection."" We regret to find that the tone of the French officials throughout the controversy is to the last degree insolent and provocative. They appear to have acted upon the principle that weak nations have no rights which France is bound to respect; and that every Frenchman who finds himself in the territory of such a nation has a right to whatever he pleases, no matter what may be the law of the country. It is this kind of treatment of other nations which has more than once drawn down upon France evils and troubles which have shaken the whole commonwealth to its very centre.

The convocation of a conference to settle the Congo question must in any case prove a matter of some little difficulty in the first place, owing to the altogether exceptional position of the Association Internationale.

In consequence of our inexperience of this order of document we cannot always feel assured that we fully apprehend its meaning. This is occasionally not a little embarrassing. If, for example, the charges made against us in the Note published in Paris on Tuesday evening were embodied in a regular diplomatic instrument, we should be certain that they were intended to be a prelude to very serious events. The Niger Company is accused of sending officers to sow agitation and incite the people to ""rebellion"" in Borgu and in the Niki region. Presumably the ""rebellion"" is against France; but as we notoriously deny that France has any rights whatever in a great part of this country north of the ninth parallel and south of the Say-Barrua line, the accusation implies a right of sovereignty on the part of France in territory which, as she is well aware, we claim as British. That would be rather a serious matter in an official Note intended for publication. Still more grave is the assertion in the same document that ""everything leads to the belief that the British Government is seeking to let things drag on, and has no intention of discussing them."" That is a direct imputation of bad faith, made not against the Niger Company this time, but against the Government of the Queen. Most ominous of all in a diplomatic correspondence would be the words with which this Note concludes. ""There is no doubt,"" they run, ""that means will be found to foil these tactics."" The natural construction to put upon them is that they are intended to convey a veiled but perfectly intelligible threat, and it need hardly be said that threats of any kind addressed to this country through the recognised diplomatic channels would meet with a very prompt and curt reply. But fortunately the Note belongs to the semi-official category, and accordingly we are free to put upon it a less unsatisfactory interpretation. We take it to mean that the French Government have realised the impossibility of pursuing any further on the West Coast of Africa the pleasant and profitable line of conduct which they have carried on with marked success for a great number of years.

The idea conceived by the explorer Crampel of connecting the French colonies of the Congo, Senegal, and Algeria has been pursued by Maistre, Mizon, Monteil, Ménard, Marchand, Ballot, Decoeur, Alby, Toutée, and other valiant explorers until this grand dream of a French colonial empire, stretching from the Mediterranean to the Gulf of Benin, began to seem not so utopian after all. But with the expansion of the Royal Niger Company and the activity of German explorers, aided by the supineness of the French Foreign Office, France has seen, during the last three or four years, much of her explorers\' work compromised. Only the other day during the hasty discussion of the Foreign Estimates, Prince d\'Arenberg asked the Minister of the Colonies whether it was true that a post established by Capt. Toutée below the Boussa Rapids had been evacuated by order of the Government. The Minister did not reply, and thus the French Africa Company has put up with a snub the like of which would not have been meted out in any other country to a body deserving so much for its sacrifices in the interests of Colonial expansion.\n\nCuriously enough, the article goes on to say, this indifference to the affairs in West Africa seems to coincide with the creation of a Colonial Ministry, and M. Delcassé, who might have played an active role in it, has been prevented by the accidents of political life from defending French interest in this region, where private enterprise has been left to its own devices. Since then colonial matters in West Africa have gone from bad to worse. The French Africa Company, however, certain indications prove, is about to begin the campaign afresh, and it must end by arousing the Ministry to greater activity.\n\nAt the meeting of the Budget Committee on Dec. 16, M. Guieysse, Minister of the Colonies, explained the reasons why he was about to ask for fresh credits of 725,000f. (£29,000) for the Ivory Coast and 975,000f. for the Upper Ubangi. But besides these credits he announced another of 100,000f. for the expense of the occupation of the Soudan, to be used mainly for the construction of the route from Konakry to the Niger. It is said, however, that this is not the whole story, that still another 100,000f. is to be asked for, and that its destination will be somewhat vaguer.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1896#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.616, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Recent Explorations in the Cameroons Interior', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In another column, our readers will find an account, given on the authority of the Paris correspondent of the *Times*, of the probable causes which led up to the late—or, shall we say present—difficulty between France and Dahomey.

The second cause has been the interest aroused throughout the country by the attractive colonial section of the Exhibition of 1889. Multitudes of all classes, who were drawn to Paris by M. Eiffel\'s masterpiece, remained to enjoy the realistic representations of their African possessions, and carried back their enthusiasm into every commune of France. There was a grain of truth in the view of a rhapsodical journalist that the light of the great tower would penetrate from the Champs de Mars to (among other places) the plains of Timbuctoo.\n\nThe dangers of prophesying are proverbial; but it appears almost certain that this new-born movement will before long be stifled, as has always previously happened, by newer and more pressing interests; so that unless the French Government seizes this golden opportunity of inducing the nation to delegate the work to Chartered Companies, which would have internal and perennial sources of energy and would be independent of Parliamentary crises and party necessities, the present agitation will lead to no practical benefit whatever to France. Until the African races reach a level at which they can dispense with minute and incessant control of Europeans, civilisation cannot cease to mount without falling back to its starting-point. The special difficulty of the Central African question lies in this early stage, during which spasmodic efforts are a sheer waste of lives, money and energy. I do not, for a moment, wish to imply that France is peculiar in the want of steady continuity on the one hand, and judicious moderation on the other, in her African policy. M. Ribot, indeed, tells his Chamber that they do these things better in England. But here, too, the ebb and flow of opinion on this question during the last three centuries remind one of those fevers which form the chief obstacle to its speedy solution. In the delirium of the hot fits, Central Africa has figured as ""La Belle au bois dormant"" ready to awake to full vitality at the first caress; while, in reality, it is a Pygmalion\'s statue, to which the gift of life will only be granted on the prayers of a fervent and constant wooer, after patient preliminary labours; ""Interea niveum mira feliciter arte Sculpit ebur."" For, I would point out in passing, although ivory and other existing products cannot make Central Africa worth holding, they form the temporary basis on which the subsequent creation of agricultural wealth must rest.

There had been for some time past a general impression that the great bulk of the French people had become so opposed to everything resembling a policy of adventure—so entirely determined in favour of home improvements, and the quiet pursuit of wealth,—that no exterior action likely in any way to compromise the nation could or would be entered upon. If we may judge by what has of late taken and is now taking place, the general conviction above expressed would seem to have been founded on error; the national abstention being only from what might by possibility lead to early complications with continental neighbours. We are led to these remarks by a series of events, some of which may have very serious results, and all of which indicate that not Monarchy or Empire were alone to blame for the perturbation France so often caused in the world at large. No one ought to desire that France should efface herself. She has a wide sphere of action open to her, which no other Power has sought to dispute with her, unless it be the feeble opposition of Italy to her late operations at Tunis. From the time when an insult by the Bey of Algiers afforded the then French Government an opportunity for putting an end to that old piratical Mahometan rule which had for ages been a standing outrage to Europe generally, and a great hindrance to commerce in the Mediterranean, Europe, by tacit general accord, regarded France as entitled to any and every extension of sway she might find necessary or desirable in that portion of the great African continent. It was felt in England that although France had not such redundancy of population, or such rapid increase of population, as could render it necessary to send out colonies, there must be a portion of her industrious and enterprising people who could be spared from home both to their own and the national advantage, if they might be located so near to her that their absence and the employment of a portion of her military force there should not diminish her power and influence in Europa in the event of any misunderstanding with neighbouring Powers. She has, therefore, had *carte blanche*—entire freedom of action as regards a large territory in North and North-east Africa; nor have we thought it at all unreasonable that she should seek to bring this territory into connection with that appertaining to the Senegal River possession. It was on this ground that when it was stated there was an absolute determination on the part of the British Government to give up the River Gambia to France, we insisted that this could never be done except on condition that France retired altogether from West Africa, south of the River Pongas, with a view of preventing future complications that might arise from French pretensions in the Melicourie and other rivers adjacent to Sierra Leone, at Grand Bassam and Assinee, at Porto Novo, and at the River Gaboon. It was, however, understood that, notwithstanding the anxiety of France to obtain possession of the River Gambia, the French mercantile interests connected with the above named places were too powerful *vis-a-vis* the French Government to allow of the latter ceding anything in return for what she coveted. From this period we have always been looking forward to French action of an embarrassing nature in West Africa; and we have it now in the neighbourhood of the River Congo, arising out of the French possession of the River Gaboon. We confess that we look with apprehension to what may take place in that quarter with the French, under the lead of so vainglorious a person as Mons. de Brazza. The French operations in that quarter would not, however, *alone* justify our charge of ""feverish restlessness"" with which we began this leader. The Réunion planters are obviously in the ascendant as regards Madagascar, which is clearly doomed, sooner or later, to become a French possession—not only because of the richness of its soil, &c., for sugar production, but because only by its becoming a French possession can the supply of labourers for Réunion from Madagascar itself be continuously assured, while it will be a stepping-stone for *African free labourers* from East Africa to hard labour and graves in Réunion. Then, again, she is pouting about Egypt, where she thinks she ought to have a preponderating influence; while she opposes the continuance in office of a tried good Governor of the Lebanon, because she has, forsooth, a greater interest in Syria and Palestine than all the other European Powers combined, and will have no one in power there unless he be devoted to French interests. It will be remembered that in a former leader, in which we stated our belief in a great future war of France and Russia against Britain, arising out of the return of the Jews to Palestine, we expressed our conviction that, notwithstanding the French Government was composed for the most part of professed freethinkers, the clerical influence was so powerful that the same counsels which led to the dispute with Russia about the keys of the Holy Sepulchre (the original cause of the Crimean War) would continue to prevail, and that French efforts would ally themselves with those of Russia in hostility to all who should aid the descendants of Jacob in becoming again a nation upon the mountains of Israel. It will thus be seen at a glance how wide-spread is the present sphere of French activity, and how possible it is that such activity will lead to deplorable results. She desires Madagascar, with, seemingly, the reopening of the African foreign slave-trade; she desires an exclusive possession up the River Congo; she will admit of no rival in N. and N.E., and indeed N.W. Africa; she has decided on possessing Tonquin; she claims preponderating influence in Egypt, Syria, and Palestine. Do these not justify our charge of ""feverish activity""? It is with any feeling but that of pleasure we thus bring it. We would have France and England in the bonds of secure friendship—the world would gain by it—but we cannot shut our eyes to facts and cry ""Peace,"" when there is no peace, but rather discord, in prospect.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1883#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

It entered Cape Coast on 10 December and left for England on 3 April 1895. Not only did the British government refuse to see the Asante mission but, while it was still there, instructed the governor on the coast to issue an ultimatum to the Asantehene to receive a British Resident and pay the war indemnity of 50000 oz of gold imposed on Asante in 1874. Of course, the Asantehene refused to comply with these requests, all the more so since he was awaiting the outcome of the mission to London.\nUsing this as an excuse, the British launched a full-scale expedition against Asante under the command of Sir Francis Scott. This expedition entered Kumasi in January 1896 without firing a shot since Prempeh and his advisors had decided not to fight the British but to accept British protection.

But the last straw that really precipitated action was the demand of the British governor, Arnold Hodgson, for the Golden Stool to be sent to him so that he could sit on it. The Golden Stool was the most sacred object of the Asante, which they considered as the embodiment of their soul and a symbol of their survival as a nation. That demand, therefore, could not but touch off an instantaneous rebellion of nearly all the principal states under the leadership of the Queen of Edweso, Nana Yaa Asantewaa (see Plate 6.2). 64 The Asante forces attacked the Governor and his party who had to seek refuge in the fort at Kumasi which the Asante then besieged. When the governor and his party escaped from the fort, the Asante fought several pitched battles with the British which lasted from April to November 1900 when Yaa Asantewaa was arrested and deported with other Asante generals to the Seychelles.\nSimilar revolts, pitched battles and guerrilla warfare raged in the Ivory Coast in response to the brutal methods including forced labour and high taxation used by that cruel Governor, Angoulvant, for the consolidation of French rule and the exploitation of the colony. This resistance by the Baule which broke out in 1908 continued until 1910 when, using the notorious search and destroy tactics, the French suppressed all remain› ing opposition with a brutality and wickedness unparalleled in the annals of African resistance (see Plate 6.5a). At the end of this, the population of the Baule had dropped from about 1.5 million in 1900 to about 260000 by .191 i.$^{6S}$ The neighbours of the Baule, the Guro, the Dan and the Bete held out till 1919.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'Conquest and reaction in British West Africa, 1880-1900 > Asante (Gold Coast)', 'content': ""Nowhere in West Africa had there been a longer tradition of confrontation between Africans and Europeans than in the Gold Coast between the Asante and the British.

In 1850 and 1863 war was narrowly averted but between 1869 and 1872, the Asante launched a three-pronged attack which resulted in the occupation of virtually all the southern and coastal states of the Gold Coast. To beat back the Asante, the British government launched one of the best organized campaigns of the period under the command of one of the most famous British officers of the day, General Garnet Wolseley. Armed with the latest weapons, this army succeeded in pushing the Asante army across the Pra river and entered and sacked Kumasi in February 1874 after a very fierce last-ditch stand by the Asante army at Amoafo near Bekwai. 40 This decisive defeat of the Asante by the British in 1874 had very far-reaching consequences and was to influence, to a great extent, the reactions of the Asante during the period 1880-1900. The first obvious effect was the disintegration of the Asante empire. By the Treaty of Fomena, Asante recognized the independence of all the vassal states south of the Pra. Taking advantage of the weakening of the military power of Asante, the vassal states to the north of the Volta river also broke away. Even the core of the empire that remained began to break up. Anxious to see that the Asante empire was never revived, the British instigated some of the member states of the Asante Union to assert their independence, and Dwaben, Kokofu, Bekwai and Nsuta began to defy the Asantehene.$^{4}$ ' The conflict between Kumasi and Dwaben in fact led to a civil war which ended in the defeat of the former and the mass migration of the people into the recently proclaimed British Protectorate and Colony of the Gold Coast.

During a bold drive on Kumasi, disaster befell Sir Charles at Nsamanku (1824), where he fell to Asante forces.$^{2}$ Spurred on by this exploit, the Asante resumed their drive towards the coast but were crushed at Dodowa (1826) by a broad coalition of coastal peoples under the aegis of the British.

The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy.

This ensuing era of fresh British expansion in Southern Africa has generated much discussion among historians. Antony Atmore and Shula Marks$^{28}$ in particular have sum› marized succinctly the current interpretations and have gone on to offer some new ideas which, in turn, have generated further research. 29 Atmore and Marks argue that the scholars who have relied most heavily on 'the official record' such as R. Robinson and J. Gallagher, broadly recognize the importance of economic factors in explaining late nineteenthcentury British imperialism, 'but veer sharply away from any further and more precise economic analysis of the events they portray, whether in South Africa or elsewhere.' Instead, the 'official mind' historians see British expansion, in the final analysis, as occurring when policy-makers are drawn irresistibly into the African (including the South African) interior to stop 'crises or emergencies' on the 'frontier' or 'periphery' of their formal colonial holdings or informal empire. However, what is omitted, Atmore and Marks point out, is the thorough analysis of these crises, which in the end proved so crucial for the creation of the British empire. In fact, when these crises are explored, they reveal that they were actually 'related to the break-down of indigenous authorities under the weight of the demands of an increasingly industrialized Britain.' In the early nineteenth century these pressures occurred mostly on the eastern front in South Africa, where the informal agents of industrialized Britain - the missionaries, traders, and administrators - were active. But with mineral discoveries in the interior in the late nineteenth century, the demands of industrialized Britain rapidly shifted there and were imposed upon both the African states and the Boer republics. Thus, although the strategic importance of the Cape on the sea route to India continued to influence British imperial policy in South Africa in the late nineteenth century, expanding British economic interests in the subcontinent weighed preponderantly."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in North-East Africa,', 'section_title': 'Egypt > The 1919 Revolution', 'content': ""Britain's colonial diplomacy of 'divide and rule' made extensive use of this cleavage in the Wafd's ranks.

All these circumstances took place during the time I was in Krepee, not twenty miles from the scene of action. However we may regret such a barbarous execution, still it must be admitted that it was done for the good of the public; and if it was unlawfully carried out, it was only because the Government that ought to have done it had long ceased to do its duty in those parts, and had formally withdrawn its protection from them. During the last twelve months the King of Ashantee has expended in Aquamboe alone no less than 1,500 or 2,000 ounces of gold in the purchase of salt, gunpowder, and lead, only. Without these supplies he must have given in to the demands of the British Government. The trade is still going on, or rather was, up to the time of the execution of Darko Yaw.\n\nIf the Government had despatched a force to occupy Aquamboe twelve months ago, it would have done much more to put an end to this war than could possibly be done by sending some 600 troops to perish in a useless campaign on the Prah.\n\nIt is very difficult for thinking men to believe that the British Government is sincerely desirous of bringing this disastrous war to a termination, for while the regular troops are encamped on the Prah, and supposed to be only waiting for the junction of the allied native forces before marching on Coomassie, the Government is issuing proclamations declaring its own people enemies; and to crown the whole, at the same time the Accra tribes are ordered to take the field, the Government is threatening the Kroboes with an invasion. What for—for aiding the Ashantees? No; but to compel them to pay an iniquitous fine, which has ruined all who ever had anything to do with it. The present phase of this Kroboe business is most disgraceful. We hear that the Government is enforcing the payment of this fine, and even threatens to sell the palm oil tree plantations of the Kroboes to the Aquapems to pay the contractors for the fine, thereby setting one tribe against another, and this at a period when unanimity is required amongst the tribes of the Eastern Districts.\n\nThe Governor called at Accra on the 6th inst., in H.M.S.

Churchill wished to express his heartfelt sympathy with the hon. baronet in the death of his brother, and also with the families of the officers who had fallen in this strife. It appeared that the differences arose from the King of Ashantee demanding the giving up, under an extradition treaty, of an alleged offender, which Governor Pine refused to do unless evidence of his guilt were supplied, upon which the King of Ashantee threatened the invasion of our territory, and in the spring of last year he invaded the Protected Territories, and the Fantees were obliged to turn out in great force to meet the invasion. Major Cochrane was sent with an auxiliary force, but he failed in his support, and in consequence the Ashantees overran the whole territory, massacred 4,000 or 5,000 Fantees, and then retired, and it was to prevent the recurrence of such an event that Governor Pine applied to the Duke of Newcastle. In reply, his grace stated that he had considered the plans submitted to him, but he declined to give his adherence to them, and he enjoined upon the Governor that the principle of all military proceedings on that coast should be that of defence, and not that of aggression, and that on that principle alone were governors entitled to make war; but ultimately Governor Pine was authorized to strike a blow against the Ashantees, if it could be done consistently with the safety of the troops. The Duke of Newcastle had shown the utmost desire that the troops should be cared for in every way—(hear, hear)—and to inveigh against the Government for culpable negligence was to make a charge which could not be sustained. Stores of various kinds calculated to serve for a long time were gathered together, and the disasters which had occurred might be attributed to the two facts that the Tamar, which conveyed the troops, had arrived a month later than was anticipated, and that the wet season set in a month earlier than usual. The delay of the vessel was not remarkable when it was remembered that the troops sent from the West Indies had to be collected from different islands, and that the ship had to make her way in the face of the trade winds. He did not think, therefore, that there was anything very unusual in arriving a month after the time expected. As to the troops being located near Cape Coast Castle, it seemed that was one of the healthiest stations on the Coast. The principal charge seemed to be that thirteen officers had died. But when this was stated, the nature of the climate must be considered, as well as the fact that all persons who went there, including the black troops, had to pass through a period of acclimatisation. This return of the deaths of officers, it must be borne in mind, extended over the whole year. He would also remind the House that officers in the line, who were anxious for rapid promotion, often exchanged into West India Regiments, and he had made the attempt himself; but if they did so they acted with the knowledge that they were exposing themselves to a climate most deleterious to health. He rather regretted the precipitate manner in which the Colonial-office had written to remove the depot at the Castle, and this not for any ulterior design of invading the territory of Ashantee, but for the purpose of ensuring the safety of those under our protection. He wished more efforts had been made to construct roads, which would not only have been valuable in a military point of view, but which would also be useful in the furtherance of commerce, and this might have been done at a trifling cost, probably at 35l. per mile. The Ashantees received a large portion of their supplies by the river Volta, one part of which formed a part of our territories, and the other part belonged to the Ashantees. That could be readily blockaded and supplies be thus cut off. Large quantities of arms, ammunition, and other munitions of war were obtained by the Ashantees through the Dutch settlements also. It was quite possible by certain arrangements to put an end to this kind of traffic. With regard to our army surgeons, two of the most competent, who were sent out with our troops, were coloured surgeons, natives of Africa, and who had been educated in the British medical schools. It appeared that they were the only two surgeons who had never been attacked with fever, or the other diseases incidental to the country. He thought that this was an important fact, which proved that if we were to maintain troops in that part of the world it was most essential to employ coloured surgeons to remain with them.

The invasion cannot be imputed to what one of your correspondents, unintentionally I hope, attributes it—the detention of Achampong in Assin. Achampong was not detained by the Assins, or any of the tribes in the protectorate. A rumour to that effect was circulated, but on inquiry it was found to be without foundation.

Matters, however, might not have arrived at this stage had the Government not stinted a little expenditure, and had they at an earlier period sent one or two influential persons to visit the different kings and chiefs, to encourage them to hasten on with their forces, and to promise them such aid and assistance as they required.

There is a cold, hard tone in his words, not calculated, we think, to induce that hearty co-operation so desirable, and so essential to success. We do not believe in the plan by which the daily supplies of rice and meat for the native troops, wherever these may be, are to be issued to the natives at the gates of Cape Coast Castle, to be thence transported to the troops by unassisted native effort. It is a mere scheme to save money and trouble; and unless we greatly err, will prove fatal to efficient native co-operation. And Sir Garnet is wrong in his facts. He told them it was not the Queen's war; it was their war. Now this is a serious mistake, and one that must have grated harshly on their ears. The Governors and Administrators, from M'Lean's time until now, have taken upon them the sole charge of the external relations of the Protected Territories. The kings and chiefs have often protested against the policy pursued; and have for years past predicted this war as a result. When, in view of the coming danger, the Fanti Confederation wished to organize against it, they were snubbed, threatened, and some of them imprisoned by the British authorities on a charge of high treason. How then can it be their war? The King of Akim asked in December last for arms and ammunition, and leave that he might attack the invading Ashantis; he was threatened with the sore displeasure of Her Majesty's Government; and thus the Ashantis were allowed free entry into the Protectorate. How then can it be their war? Sir Garnet sought to prove that it was their war, by quoting the Ashanti declaration of 1863-4 that they had come to war with the Fantis, not with the English. Competent judges believe that the invasion of 1863 would not have taken place had we not allowed some human sacrifices to pass unpunished, from which the King of Ashanti inferred that the British Government no longer exercised authority throughout the territories. They therefore made a distinction between us and the Fantis, hoping they might be allowed to eat up the latter. In January, February, and March last they must have believed we had now decided to allow them to do so. No, no! Sir Garnet.

At the present moment we have not more than 4,000 or 5,000 men in the field, whilst the enemy is ten times as numerous.

It was our Government who sent the King of Ashanti ""douceurs"" (they call them presents), so that his Majesty might the more readily listen to their prayers for peace, and his Majesty willingly accepted their ""presents,"" and laughed at them in his sleeves. It was our Government who sent to inform his Majesty that they were ready to double the annual stipend that he was receiving from the Dutch, as sop, provided the King would reopen trade, and not continue to frighten us out of our wits by threatening war, when we were desirous of going on our knees and sueing for peace. It was our Government that has committed a thousand other acts as impolitic to soothe the feelings of the outraged monarch of Ashanti; that danced to any and all the tunes that his Majesty played on his royal diplomatic fiddle, and that will continue to hop, skip, and dance, after the present disturbance, to whatever tune, the royal fiddler may think fit to treat them to.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-02-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_03_1873#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.735, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE ASHANTI WAR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'No one believed throughout the protectorate, not even the gentleman who pretends to be omnipotent with the King of Ashanti, that his Majesty ever intended delivering up his German prisoners just now; and if the 1,000l. he asked for them had been sent up—and we believe that it would have been if this same gentleman could have had his way—his Majesty would have coolly pocketed the money, retained the white prisoners, and still have come to war.

I will write you something more about this affair, and about the change that has come over the people in other parts of our territories with regard to the Ashantee war. It seems to\n\nme that the sufferings inflicted on the country last year in consequence of the shameful military mismanagement, which allowed the Ashantees to ravage in all directions, have not only put an end to the enthusiasm the people felt when the war began, but quite sickened them of it.

The preparations which have been, and still are, making by Her Majesty’s Government, are on a scale of sufficient magnitude to attract notice, and it is not surprising, therefore, that during a Parliamentary recess, all our daily contemporaries, who have been accustomed to turn their blind side upon West African matters, as too insignificant for serious regard, should have devoted a portion of their columns, morning after morning, to the news from the West Coast, to Government preparations, and supposed plans and objects. Nor is it strange that quite a number of persons, who have been or are more or less connected with the West Coast, officially or commercially, should have rushed in to the assistance of the editors, with statements, criticisms, plans, and objections, of very varied degrees of truth and importance. Leader after leader, letter after letter, have given to this embryo Ashanti war an importance greatly disproportioned to that of any operations that have hitherto marked its progress. When we called attention in January last to the well-authenticated fact of a large force of Ashantis having crossed the Prah and destroyed several villages, the Administrator at Cape Coast and the Government at home preferred to ignore the whole affair. If Col. Harley, instead of pooh-poohing the information furnished by the native kings on the frontier with that supercilious contempt which but too often characterizes military officials, had sent up the small supplies of ammunition requested, the invading forces might have received a check sufficient to have caused them to abandon their enterprise. Instead of this, the frontier kings were peremptorily ordered to abstain from all acts of hostility against the body of Ashanti traders, as it suited the then views and purposes of the Administrator to designate them. Unimpeded, therefore, in their early operations, and not meeting with resistance in any form, the advanced corps was followed by a main army, of sufficient magnitude to force the knowledge of the disagreeable fact of their presence in the country upon the reluctant mind of the Exeçutive. But even then that Executive confined itself to the issuing of proclamations and the dispatch of special commissioners, attended by a certain number of Houssa police, with instructions to observe and report, but not under any circumstances to come into collision with the invading forces. Nothing effectual was done to promote the cohesion of the native tribes, to organize them and lead them against the enemy. They were told that it was their duty to defend their country, but they were not furnished with adequate means for doing this. Ammunition, when granted, was doled out as if every pound of powder was more valuable than a native life; nor was any attempt made to assist them in obtaining such supplies of provisions as would enable them to keep the field. All this was exposed in our columns, wherein we also showed, by brief but graphic accounts of the actions fought, that if properly organized, officered, led, and supplied, the Fantis, whom it is so much the fashion to vilify as cowards, would have of themselves sufficed to turn back the destructive tide of invasion. There can be no doubt whatever that at that time it was the deliberate official intention to limit British protection and action to a mere meagre contribution of arms and ammunition, provided the Ashantis did not advance to a point which must be considered as endangering Cape Coast, Elmina, or other Coast settlements. Too much was said at that time about the advisability of giving the Ashantis a port on the Coast, and consequently a permanent footing there, to allow or to admit the possibility of such a compromise not having been seriously admitted into the Executive mind. But such a project was of too infamous a nature to allow of its even passing beyond the obscure stage. It would not bear the light. It would have been a surrender of the lives of every man, woman, and child in the protected territories to the knife of the Ashanti executioners, with no more noble aim than that of our being permitted to levy certain duties, producing a large revenue, to be eaten up by an official staff. But although this infamous idea could not pass beyond the realm of ideas, or even ripen into fact, it had done a mischief for which Great Britain will now have to atone, by the sacrifice of many valuable lives and the expenditure of no inconsiderable a sum of money. The Ashantis could not attach any other meaning to the abstention of the British authorities from all active participation in the Fanti resistance than that the British were now too weak to resist them, or intended to abandon the Coast should sufficient pressure be brought to bear upon them. They could not, naturally enough, comprehend a policy which should allow them to advance without serious resistance to within a few miles of the seat of Government, if there was any intention of a resolute defence of the Coast Settlements. And so they pressed on, until their interference with the British bombardment of Elmina opened their eyes to the error into which they had fallen. It had then become too late for them to retreat; they had settled down into occupation of large districts as conquerors, bringing down their wives and slaves, and otherwise manifesting a fixed determination to extend the frontiers of Ashanti from the Prah to the ocean. And there they still are; the loss they suffered before Elmina has induced a caution which keeps them at a respectful distance from that place and Cape Coast, although they have never ceased to threaten both, but which has not prevented their detaching sufficient forces to Ashanti and Appolonia to enable them so to dominate the public mind, as to detach kings, chiefs, and people from British allegiance, as evinced at the interview of Commodore Commerell with the King of Chamah, and the subsequent deplorable events at Chamah and Tacorady. What can an impartial chronicler or historian say to all this? What but that, if it has been the result of an honest British policy, that policy has been an exceedingly ignorant and contemptible one; and if the result of an incipient dishonest policy, it meets with the retribution it deserves, in being compelled to an expenditure of life and money the limits of which no one can at present foresee; and to a possibly total reversion of ideas and feelings with regard to settlements which have been looked upon as worthless and compromising—a legacy of national slave trade iniquity, involving constant loss and disaster, without any chance of compensation either in honour or profit—either pecuniary, moral, or national. For our own part, it is well known that we believe in a great future of those countries—a future which we believe will be importantly hastened by this war, which, however, we have done our best to avert, by persistently clamouring for measures which, if they had found favour in Colonial office eyes, and been adopted, would have made it for ever impossible.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-09-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_09_1873#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.728, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""Mr. Gladstone's Declaration on the Ashanti War"", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'we shall, I hope, seek to draw from what has happened a lesson on the duty of avoiding in future the first entrance into equivocal and entangling engagements.

The address from which this extract is taken, is one of great power and intense interest, shadowing forth, as it does, changes of extreme importance to the whole British community, and which must influence materially the future destinies of the country. Nor have we any fault to find with the above observations relative to the Ashanti War, except in the paragraphs as to ""the establishment of friendship with the Ashantees,"" and ""the duty of avoiding in future the first entrance into equivocal and entangling engagements."" The latter is a fine phrase, meaning nothing, and copied out of Mr. Bright\'s textbook—a bad volume for a Minister to study as regards foreign relations. Should equivocal and entangling engagements appear to be necessary in the future, for forwarding some great object of Imperial policy, they will be entered into then as they have been entered into in the past. One unacquainted with the history of our connection with the Gold Coast countries, would imagine that, by some act of official stupidity, we had recently entered into engagements which had led to this Ashanti War. Nothing can be farther from the truth. Our engagements with the Gold Coast at this time—those engagements which have forced us into the present Ashanti War—are the unavoidable legacy of the foreign slave trade we ruthlessly carried on there for more than a century, and the efforts since made by the conscience-stricken British nation to put a final end to that abominable traffic. We were thus naturally led to, and detained on, the Gold Coast. We could not remain there without being supreme, and asserting and exercising our supremacy. In the exercise of this supremacy, we became naturally the protectors of the Gold Coast against enemies by sea or land. We consequently took upon ourselves the direction of its external relations, among the chief of which were those with Ashanti; and if there is now a war between us and Ashanti, that war is not the result of Fantee action, nor of ""our having entered into equivocal engagements,"" but of a culpable neglect and mismanagement on our part, the responsibility for which does not attach to the present Administration alone, but to many successive Administrations, which have chosen to shut their eyes to, and take no efficient measures to prevent, results which every unofficial person connected with those countries could foresee. Then, as regards friendship with Ashanti, as a result of the present advance on Kumasi. Should the Ashanti power survive the victory which we are bound to obtain over it at whatever cost, there could not be any friendship between it and us, except by a total change in its principles, customs, and character. Kumasi is a charnel-house, a slaughter-pen, where the blood of innocent human victims is incessantly flowing. Hitherto we have not been responsible for this, save that by a national effort, such as Ashanti has now forced upon us, we might have put an end to it. But if we entered into relations with it (after having conquered it) that would re-establish and perpetuate it, we should be responsible, and guilty as a nation, before God and man. Friendship between light and darkness is not less impossible than friendship, under such circumstances, between Christian Britain and the Ashanti which has been known of up to this present time. But our own opinion, expressed at the commencement of the present operations, and which we still retain, is that there will not be any danger of our falling into such a snare of guilty complicity with a murderous superstition, because the Ashanti power, losing all its prestige by our successful advance on Kumasi, will fall in pieces. It has only existed hitherto through the mutual jealousies of divers people, whom it has played one against another, while using them all for its aggressive operations. We may be mistaken; but this, we repeat, is our confirmed opinion; and it will be well for the Administration of which Mr. Gladstone is the head that this contingency should be maturely considered, in order that they may be able to deal in the most advantageous manner with the emergency should it arise.', 'last_edit_date': '1874-01-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_01_1874#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.755, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE ASHANTI ENVOYS IN ENGLAND.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—The Ashanti Ambassador has consulted me in reference to the various articles appearing in the Press touching on this subject, and he has requested me in fairness to ask that you will permit me to make some comment thereon inasmuch as the English version of the matter has alone been presented to the public. There appears to be some foundation for believing that a military expedition has been sent to Coomassie, or is about to be, for the purposes of compelling the King of Ashanti to accept a British Resident at his capital, whether the same be just, expedient, or otherwise. It is but fair (and Englishmen always boast of their fairness) that our Government and the King of Ashanti should have the like opportunities of putting their case before the British public, although I am aware that the public Press is not exactly the constitutional medium generally appealed to. The Ambassadors, however, are in London, and having appealed to the Government for a hearing (which has been refused), they can but now appeal to the Press for the ventilation of their alleged grievances—the more especially as I understand that the British Government are not slow on occasions to recognise that as a correct medium. According to my instructions, it would appear that Prempeh was not elected to the stool of Ashanti by us, so much so that we refused to interfere with the Ashantees\' selection at all, but fully recognised their action by having present our official representative at the coronation, and acknowledged him as King of Ashanti. There cannot be any manner of doubt about this, as it is borne out by the Blue records from 1888 to 1894. I am also told that when the British Government submitted the proposal that a British Resident should be received, the King was correctly designated by us as ""King of Ashanti,"" although at that time we were aware of the fact now alleged that ""the old Ashanti Confederation"" has been broken up""—a confederation which, I am instructed, had never existed. My clients emphatically deny that the King has ever broken or violated any of his treaty engagements. They deny, too, that he has countenanced human sacrifice, a fact which I am told is negatived by our own records; nor has he, it is urged, hampered trade and attacked tribes under British protection. It is also denied that he has raided for slaves. On the contrary, my clients inform me that the King has cause to complain of want of frankness towards him, and that our representative in the Gold Coast, while professing friendship towards the King, has, as a fact, been acting contrary to his pledges. The King is prepared to open his country to British skill, and does not seek to hamper trade as is suggested. The Ambassadors submit that the fact of Ashanti being ""within the sphere of British influence"" does not carry away the King\'s independence as a sovereign, nor justify the hostile attitude our Government are assuming. That the King is an independent sovereign, there cannot be any question in the face of the reply of the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, given in February last, and if England claims the right to send a mission to the King whenever she feels inclined, my clients urge that the same privilege should be extended to their King when he is acting with bona fides and in the honest belief that he is acting within his rights. The mission have travelled some thousands of miles to discuss the position and treat with her Majesty\'s advisers, and if only on the grounds of fair play, and apart from any precedent, the Government could receive them, there certainly would not be any particle of reason why one ounce of blood should be shed. Of course, in expressing the foregoing views I am carrying out my instructions, not, however, with any doubts as to the justice of the King\'s claim, but with a keen sense of the Ambassador\'s sincerity.—I am, sir, yours, &c.,', 'last_edit_date': '1895-10-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1895#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.742, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Anticipated Trouble in Ashanti', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Just as we are going to press, we learn through Reuter's Agency that, in consequence of the hostile action of the King of Coomassie (the old Ashanti confederation having been broken up), the Government has instructed the Governor of the Gold Coast to send Colonel Sir Francis Scott home for the purpose of consulting with the authorities as to the force required to deal with the troubles, and whether it will be necessary to despatch additional troops from England. Of course, an Ashanti war would not be anything like as large an undertaking as the expedition of twenty years ago: many who then fought against the British are now living quietly under their protection.\n\nIt appears that the King of Coomassie is alleged to have violated treaty engagements with Great Britain by the continuation of the practice of human sacrifices, as well as by hampering trade and attacking neighbouring tribes which are under British protection. There are other causes of complaint, one of which is the difficulty he has placed in the way of the appointment of a British Resident at Coomassie. Communications on these subjects have for some time been taking place between the King of Coomassie and the Governor of the Gold Coast. The former has been temporising, but there is still hope that the differences now existing may be arranged without a resort to war. It is nevertheless felt necessary to be prepared for a less favourable contingency, and with this view, as mentioned above, Sir Francis Scott, Inspector of Constabulary of the Gold Coast, has been summoned home for the purpose of conferring with the War Office about the preparations for the military expedition to Ashanti, should war prove inevitable.\n\nSeveral Native envoys from Ashanti recently arrived in London with a commission from their king to negotiate with the British Government on some of the questions now at issue.

We have never, in African matters, been partizans of either Conservative or Liberal Administrations. Both, and equally, have, to our mind, dealt neglectfully and unwisely, and therefore unjustly and injuriously, with Western Africa. But when we see an attempt to overwhelm the late Administration with such questions as the following, we become for a moment partizans of the late Government, notwithstanding all its errors and shortcomings, of which we have felt personally the sad effects. ""How did the quarrel with King Koffee Kalcalli arise? In obedience to what principle of national duty did we send an expedition beyond the Prah? What advantage have we secured by burning down Kumasi, and shattering the power of the only negro State which offered any semblance of a stable government? What do we hope to gain by peace and friendship with the Ashantees, supposing that we have inclined them thereto by the measures we have taken for their destruction? We have to satisfy our national conscience on all these points, or else we shall have won what is something less than even a barren triumph."" This is meant, no doubt, to be a formidable indictment, yet the answer is simple enough. The quarrel with King Kalcalli dates from his predecessor\'s reign, in 1862, when the Gold Coast authorities refused to deliver up the refugee ""Ganim."" No peace has since been made. It was always understood that the Ashantees were busy accumulating ammunition, and the Dutch withdrawal and Elmina discontent, brought the slumbering hostilities to a head again. It is not difficult to prove that it was our duty to rid the Protectorate of them. The only error was, that that was not understood at the commencement, before they half-ruined the country and bearded us in our seacoast forts. It being our duty to get rid of them, it must have been equally our duty to get rid of them effectually. This could only be done by what has since been done—by following them into their own territory, destroying their military prestige, burning their capital, and shattering the power ""of the only negro State which offered any semblance of a stable government."" Detestable government, might well have been said. As to what we hope to gain by peace and friendship with them, after the measures we have taken for their destruction, the reply is not difficult. Having gained a full assurance of peace for the Protectorate, by destroying the military prestige and power of its only enemy, we give that humbled enemy liberty to carry on, as heretofore, that trade with the sea-coast without which he cannot live; and which he could not have ventured on without a treaty, because the Assins, Wassaws, Denkeras, &c., would have murdered and plundered the traders, on the ground of their being still enemies. The Ashantees, and the people of their formerly tributary states and others beyond, cannot exist without communication with the Coast, for that most indispensable article, salt, and many others. We wish them to have these; we have an advantage in their coming to buy them in our territory: we guarantee them, by treaty, peaceable access, on certain terms. This will give them again their old advantages as intermediate traders between the seacoast and the people beyond. In the supposition that there is an engagement on the part of the King of Ashanti that there shall be no more human sacrifices, this is sneered at as having ""a shining moral appearance."" When we reflect on the myriads of human beings that have been offered there in sacrifice, until the whole atmosphere of the capital was poisoned by the sickly exhalation from human gore and putrefying carcases, we feel ineffable disgust at this ""shining moral appearance."" If no other good end had been obtained by us, this one alone, if obtained, is worthy of a great Christian civilized nation; and, should be deemed, if power has duties as well as rights, a full and exceeding recompense for the effort we have made, even though the ""sacrifice of other lives which it has entailed"" should all be debited to this account, which we deny. As to the war ""having been always unnecessary,"" we have not space to join issue on the point as it deserves. All we shall say is, it can only be deemed unnecessary, provided it could be established that, if earlier measures had been taken by the Cape Coast Government to aid the native tribes of the Protectorate, they alone would have sufficed for rolling back the invasion. We always believed this might have been effected. But even then the war could scarcely be deemed unnecessary, as the territories would have been continually threatened with invasion and devastation, murder, and all other enormities of barbarian inroads. There was no permanent remedy to be found, no permanent security to be obtained, save by the invasion of Ashanti. This has been, happily, accomplished, and however party feeling may suffer at the too speedy and economical success, we rejoice that there is no longer any probability of our ever having again to deplore an Ashanti invasion of the Gold Coast.', 'last_edit_date': '1874-03-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/28_03_1874#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.728, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Menace of War by Ashanti', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'circumstances, of appointing a mere military man. Sir Samuel Rowe having had experience in those countries, having been at Coomassie with Sir John Glover, and shared, no doubt, with Sir John the disgust of not being allowed to remain there awhile and place the affairs of the countries beyond the Prah on a permanent peace footing, he knows the people with whom he has to deal, and has no more fear of an Ashantee than of any other untutored savage. Such a man, we hope, will see the necessity of something more than to be content that no invasion has taken place, or that it has been repulsed. It is not compatible with the dignity of the British Government, or with the duty of the latter to the countries under its protection, that the latter should remain liable to a repetition of the “Golden Axe” insult whenever it may suit a vain and ignorant barbarian to inflict it. Sir Samuel Rowe will, we hope, recognize the necessity, and make that necessity to be fully comprehended in Downing-street, that a definite line of policy must be adopted, and certain efficient measures be taken and maintained, as regards Ashanti and the other native States beyond the River Prah such as shall put an end for ever to the possibility of the recurrence of insulting threats, with their disturbing influence on industrial pursuits in the countries of the protectorate, and needless expense both to the Imperial and Colonial Exchequer. To give security to a country as well as to preserve peace and order in it, is one of the first duties of a sovereign power. This security the British Government must now give to the Fantee countries. We have made them dependent on us for protection, and we must make that protection efficient—not spasmodic, according to the varying humour of an insolent neighbouring barbarian, but constant and assured beyond the possibility of doubt. If it be said that the British Parliament, uninstructed by the fate of Old Rome, would not consent to any charge on the British Exchequer for any requisite measurer, then we say that the revenues of the protected territories, now not less than 100,000l. a year, are adequate for securing the interest on a public loan for the small amount that would be required. We have before contended that this revenue should be made available for guaranteeing railroads, and for other works of public improvement, that may aid in the development of the natural resources, vegetable and mineral, of those territories; but though we have the construction of railways there deeply at heart, we would postpone these and all other aids to industry in favour of that one great first aid without which all others are liable to fail in their object—security, perfect security, for life and property against the threat of barbarian invasion. We venture to hope that Sir Samuel Rowe will be the instrument through whom this great aid will be obtained. For ages past Ashanti has been the curse of all neighbouring countries. It was delivered into our hands in 1873-4 for destruction, and we failed in our duty, allowed it to be revived, and again to become insolent, and are now suffering the temporary disturbance of important industries, and compelled to incur considerable expense, because of that insolence. The line must be drawn somewhere; let it be drawn at the late “Golden Axe” menace; and then, within a few years, our great expectations of national wealth to come from those territories will be realized.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1881#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.727, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE END AND PURPOSE OF THE ASHANTI WAR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Peace, to large and populous countries of the interior of Africa. We cannot conceive any reason why those countries should not contain some of those to-be blessed people, of whom we have thus made mention; and if they do so contain them, and these are to be reached only by the prostration and destruction of that most awfully blood-stained kingdom, this war will be made an instrument for opening the way to those who will willingly set forth with the glad tidings. Again, if they do so contain them, and they are only thus to be reached, the honour which God thus offers to our beloved country is in our eyes so great, as to outweigh a hundredfold any temporary pecuniary outlay, or any sacrifices far more painful, that the procuring of it may involve. And while we look at the progress of events during the last fifty years of our relations with the Gold Coast countries, we cannot avoid the conviction that there has been a gradual Divine preparation for Great Britain, of this honour which she has sought to repudiate and to avoid, even to the very verge of national dishonour. We believe that, however nations, and especially so-called Christian nations, may desire to live and act for their own ends, interests, and purposes alone, an overruling Divine Governor shapes that selfish life and purposes to the accomplishment of His own great supreme designs as regards the children of men. In the pursuit of that abominable object—the carrying on of a foreign slave trade, a cruel dealing in human flesh for gain—several European nations, and among them Great Britain, obtained sea-side settlements on the Gold Coast. We need not enter here upon any detail of the causes and events which led to the final extinction of that sinful trade there carried on. Suffice it to say, that by conquest and purchase, Great Britain became, with the Dutch, the only possessors of sea-coast dominions there; and that, finally, so late as 1872, the Dutch, compelled by native African pressure—which Great Britain not only did not aid or assist, but condemned and opposed—were glad to abandon all the posts they occupied, upon the mere payment to them by Great Britain of the money value of the stores they left behind them. A few words will suffice to show how important a difference was thus made in the position and responsibilities of Great Britain as regards the Protected Territories and Ashanti. The Ashantees are the hereditary and deadly enemies of the people of the Protectorate, whom they have long regarded as their rightful prey, and have sought to annihilate, that they might themselves enter into undisputed possession of these countries, and their coveted sea-coast. While the Dutch were joint possessors with the English of the sea-board of the Gold Coast, the latter were greatly restricted in their action. The Dutch were always friends and allies of the Ashantees. They had still a little slave trade of their own under another name, the victims of which were brought down from Ashanti. Whenever the Ashantees made an invasion of the Protected Territories, they received ammunition and arms, and all necessary supplies, through the Dutch towns. By the retirement of the Dutch last year, this was all changed, and we were brought face to face with Ashanti. In the furtherance of a most short-sighted and selfish policy, the British Government had of late years openly proclaimed that the people of the so-called Protectorate must in future depend upon themselves alone for their defence against their deadly enemy. This, too, while they still retained solely in their own hands the conduct of all relations with that enemy, which became thus British relations, and not theirs; while, too, they exacted obedience to all behests, so far as they chose, throughout the entire Protectorate; levied, collected, and retained for their own use the entire import duties, amounting, in 1872, to above 50,000l.; and not only refused to allow, but put down an effort at native union for defence against the Ashantees, for making roads and educating the people; and this, as it seemed to us, chiefly because it would necessarily involve their apportioning to the Fanti Confederation a share of the revenues they levied, and the formation of a native organized military force, not immediately under the command of the British Administrator. The Ashantees saw and knew of all this; they could not fail to do so, because the British administrative voice was continuously loud that all the people of the Protectorate could expect from them in any future invasion was a small supply of arms and ammunition. Was not this an encouragement by Great Britain to the Ashantees to invade the territories which she thus declared she would neither herself protect, nor allow the natives to organize efficiently to protect? It was such an encouragement, and was followed by just such results as might have been anticipated. We knew, of course, that, in the event of a formidable invasion, the British Government would be forced to take the field, sooner or later, against the aggressors, though the Ashantees believed that they would not; being encouraged therein by the British authorities treating for the ransom of the German missionaries whom they had kidnapped within the bounds of the Protectorate. And the British local authorities seem to have been of the same opinion; having, if we may judge by the course pursued, adopted Sir Charles Adderley's principles and ideas, that the British Government occupied their positions on the Gold Coast merely for purposes of trade; that it was quite indifferent to them whether the trade was with Fantees or Ashantees, and consequently that there was no reason why the Ashantees should not be allowed to annihilate the natives, and occupy their territories, provided always they respected those British positions, and would pay the Customs' duties levied there. The Ashanti monarch therefore sent the vanguard of his army across the River Prah early in December, 1872. They commenced by destroying the villages in their route. The King of Akim dispatched messengers in hot haste to Colonel Harley at Cape Coast, informing him of what had happened, of the imminent danger, and requesting a supply of arms and ammunition, that he might attack the invaders. Colonel Harley, however, was too fully imbued with Sir Charles Adderley's principles and ideas, to view these things in the same light as they appeared to the King of Akim. Instead of sending the prayed-for supplies, he ordered the King of Akim to abstain from all hostilities, unless he chose to incur the heavy displeasure of Her Majesty's Government. The result was what might have been expected. Encouraged by the absence of all opposition, fortified by Colonel Harley's pacific dispositions, in their belief that the Fantees were to be entirely given up to their tender mercies, the Ashantees flooded in. Time came, when their large army was within thirty or forty miles of Cape Coast (having destroyed some fifty or sixty villages), that Colonel Harley could not regard them any longer as ardent traders, coming down to fill the colonial chest with Customs' duties; but, still true to the Adderley principles and ideas, in sending up a couple of officers with some Houssas to inspect and report, he is understood to have ordered that under no circumstances should they fire a shot against the invaders. The Fantees had then advanced a large force against them. Those officers, with the Houssas, saw the Fantees overpowered in fight by them, yet abstained from giving any aid. Is it a matter of surprise that the Ashantees should at last have believed that not only had the British abandoned the Fantees to them, but that, with a little pressure, they would give up Elmina and Cape Coast Castle also, and leave the Gold Coast to their sole possession? We are merely showing how this Ashanti War has come about; that Great Britain has brought it entirely on herself, through the prevalence of dishonouring administrative principles and ideas, and the dignified incompetence of her local executive head; that she is forced into it against her will, through neglect of sacred and obvious duties; and that, as thus now acting in opposition to her own wishes and desires, she is—if she will now perform her duty adequately, persistently, and inflexibly—an instrument in the hands of an overruling Providence for working out a great intent. Ashanti has been a standing Satanic outrage against God and man. Her soil—and especially that of her capital town, Kumassie—is saturated with human gore—the incessant blood tribute relentlessly poured forth at the behests of a beastly superstition. Great Britain, though full of contempt and disdain for such a feeble and savage enemy—totally wanting in adequate military organization and armament to oppose her, and only difficult to conquer because the country to be traversed is without roads, furnishes none of the means of subsistence, and has a deleterious climate—has been compelled to enter the lists against her.

The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy.

In a similar vein, references have been made to the presence of Asante representatives in all types of states and also to the introduction of substantial Asante features into the Dagomba army or interventions by the Asantehene in Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes. 14 It is obvious nevertheless that the mandates of the Asante regional commissioners varied according to the situation.

There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'African Reactions and Responses in West Africa, > The Yaa Asantewaa War', 'content': 'Like the Hut Tax rebellion of 1898, the Asante uprising of 1900 was precipitated by the attempts of the British to consolidate their rule by the deposition of some of the anti-British chiefs and the appointment to replace them of people who were not traditionally qualified, and by the imposition of a tax, in this case 4s per head, as a war indemnity in 1897. But the last straw that really precipitated action was the demand of the British governor, Arnold Hodgson, for the Golden Stool to be sent to him so that he could sit on it. The Golden Stool was the most sacred object of the Asante, which they considered as the embodiment of their soul and a symbol of their survival as a nation. That demand, therefore, could not but touch off an instantaneous rebellion of nearly all the principal states under the leadership of the Queen of Edweso, Nana Yaa Asantewaa (see Plate 6.2). 64 The Asante forces attacked the Governor and his party who had to seek refuge in the fort at Kumasi which the Asante then besieged. When the governor and his party escaped from the fort, the Asante fought several pitched battles with the British which lasted from April to November 1900 when Yaa Asantewaa was arrested and deported with other Asante generals to the Seychelles.\nSimilar revolts, pitched battles and guerrilla warfare raged in the Ivory Coast in response to the brutal methods including forced labour and high taxation used by that cruel Governor, Angoulvant, for the consolidation of French rule and the exploitation of the colony.

At one time, he would play the two Christian sects, Catholics and Protestants, against Muslims when he thought the latter were becoming too powerful and therefore threatening his control of the country. At another time, he would ally with Muslims against Catholics or Protestants or both depending on who he thought was dangerous to his rule. Thus, Mwanga was adept at the diplomatic game of divide and rule, a tactic which the colonizing powers were able to use so effectively in controlling Africa. When it was necessary, Mwanga resorted to a revival of some old tradition in an attempt to drive out all foreigners as happened in 1888.$^{30}$ On this occasion, he intended to entice all foreigners and their Baganda followers to a naval parade on an island on Lake Victoria. There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler.

Added to this, he had developed several tactics, such as constantly moving from one town to another, pitting one European nation, company or individual against another, and postponing decisions to frustrate impatient concessionaires. As a longer-range strategy, he sought either military alliance or protectorate status with the British government to counter the Germans, Portuguese and Afrikaners, and so prevent uncontrolled South African colonial expansion.\nThese forms of diplomatic resistance apparently worked effectively until 1888, when the South African financier, Cecil John Rhodes, convinced Sir Hercules Robinson, the High Commissioner, and Sir Sidney Shippard, the Deputy Commissioner for Bechuanaland, to enlist the help of the Reverend John Smith Moffat.

With regard also to the Ashantees now in Aöwin, the King states that Andor, the Elmina chief, was sent up to Coomassie in attendance at the late King's funeral rites, and as he had since received information that the road to Elmina by Prahsue had been blockaded or stopped, he considered it safe and prudent to send him back to Elmina by the Aöwin direction, duly escorted by one of his captains, Ackampon Asantoo, with troops, who himself had been trained up at Elmina, with instructions to the King of Aöwin to have a passage procured for him for his conveyance by water down to Elmina.""}, {'id': 1882, 'article_title': 'West African News', 'full_section_title': 'West African News', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1870#article-2', 'issue_date': '23_09_1870', 'content': 'By the Biafra, which arrived in the Mersey on the 28th August with the monthly mails, the following was reported:—\n\nThe health of the different rivers was good, and trade generally brisk, with the exception of Bonny, where it was at a complete standstill.\n\nThere were immense quantities of produce about the coast, waiting the arrival of ships to take it away.

Some important messages had been received from Ashantee, the King offering to surrender all the Fantees in his dominion, on condition that the English Administrator gave up all the Ashantees in the Protectorate. He also suggests that all property seized by either side should be exchanged. It was also stated that the famous Ashantee Chief, Quaguah (who negotiated the treaty with Governor Maclean for the surrender of all refugees) was about to be sent as ambassador. Governor Nagtglas was also sending back to Coomassie, through Assinnee, the Ashantees at Elmina.

Mr. Thomas Forson was commissioned by the Governor of Cape Coast to go up to Coomassie to negotiate with the King of Ashantee for the release of the four Europeans who are still held prisoners in the Ashantee capital. The captives are Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey, Mr. Kuhne, and Mr. Bonnart. Mr. Ramsey was a missionary at Anoom, and was captured two years ago by a detachment of the army of Oddoo Boffoe. It is stated that nothing could have been more wanton and cruel than the manner in which the captives were treated. All their property, together with that of the mission, &c., was destroyed or plundered, and they were compelled to travel all the way from Anoom to Coomassie on foot. The troops who escorted them used them very ill on the way, and in consequence of exhaustion and want of nourishment Mrs. Ramsey\'s baby died.\n\nMr. Forson returned to Cape Coast on the 23rd of June, accompanied by a special messenger from the King of Ashantee, and it was believed that his visit would not be altogether fruitless. The king was not unwilling to restore his English prisoners to freedom, but urged that, according to the custom of his nation, the commander whose troops seized the captives and ordered them to be sent up to Coomassie must first make his appearance at the capital and give his report of the proceedings, before the captives could be finally dealt with. In the meantime it was believed that there was no cause for any uneasiness on their account.

When the remnant of the troops which comprised the first army of invasion of the Eastern Province entered Coomassie, there was public lamentation on account of the numbers that had fallen in the war, and, according to the fearful custom of the country, there were terrible human sacrifices; ""in fact, hardly any description,"" according to an eye-witness, ""could exaggerate the reality.""

The palaver hall was decorated with flags and green leaves; chairs and forms were conveniently placed. The Administrator sat on a large armchair in front of a large table placed at the top of the hall; on his right were Major Reece, commanding the troops, and officers of the garrison, and colonial staff, on his left the colonial secretary or collector of customs and merchants. In front on the right were the chiefs and caboceers of Cape Coast, and on the left Prince Ansah, Mr. Watts, and the Ashantee ambassadors; at the back were the people of Cape Coast and the prisoners who had been exchanged.  \nThe Administrator opened the meeting by stating that he welcomed the ambassadors, and as they brought a message from their king he was glad to hear what they had to say in public. The chief ambassador rose and made a long statement in the native tongue, and at the end presented a letter from the King to the Administrator, in which was contained all what he had said. His Majesty commenced by declaring his peaceful intentions to the English Government, and then brought several charges against the Akims and Assins, who formerly were subjects of Ashanti, but now under British protection; the King wished that bygones should be bygones, and that the Governor should not listen to the advice of ill-disposed councillors, as he intended not to do the same; he apologised for not having effected the exchange before this time, as he had several customs to perform, and hoped that on the return of his ambassadors there will be good feelings between the two Governments.  \nThe Administrator expressed his delight at the peaceful tone of the King's letter, and said that he would take time to consider what reply he would give them after consulting with the other members of the Council.  \nThe question now arises, is the King of Ashanti sincere in"", 'last_edit_date': '1871-03-14', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_04_1871#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""CAPTAIN LEES' MISSION TO ASHANTI."", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—You will, I know, be anxious to learn how Captain Lees\' mission to the Ashanti countries progressed and terminated; and I think you will be pleased with the results, so far as they have transpired. It is not easy to know exactly all that occurred, but I think you can rely on the following so far as it goes:\n\nYou will remember that the message of the King to the Governor-in-Chief was in the form of a deprecation of collision between himself and his late associate or tributary kings, and especially between himself and Juabin. He had been trying by all possible means to bring the Juabins to serve under him again, but they refused. He then sent threatening messages to them, whereupon they took up arms against him, and were joined by Quocofoo and Mampon.\n\nOn the arrival of Captain Lees, the King endeavoured to impress on him the importance of his power; but he was soon undeceived, as the homely truth was soon brought to him that he had none. He wanted to have all the chiefs again under his government; but he was told that the British Government is perfectly neutral in the matter; if the chiefs like to return, they may; but if not, they may remain as they are. He was very much annoyed and downcast at this decision, but there was no help for it. He was plainly told, should he go to war against Juabin, that Quocofoo, Mampon, and others would join them; and the result would be, that he would be dethroned and somebody else put in his place. After a good deal of palavering, he gave in, and Captain Lees, after much talk, got him to agree to the five following propositions:—\n\n1. The separation and independence of Juabin.\n2. That there must be general peace between all parties.\n3. That all prisoners in the possession of each party should be delivered, so that those who wish to return may do so.\n4. That roads to the interior be kept opened, and no party shall be molested whilst passing through for trade, &c.\n5. That all old quarrels are to be buried, and not to be raked up again.\n\nAfter the King had agreed to these, Captain Lees went to Juabin, saw the King and Chiefs, and then explained to them all the advantages they would obtain by this arrangement, which they finally agreed to accept. The King of Ashanti wanted them to come and eat fetish with him, or ratify the agreement in Kumasi; but the wily Juabins were too wide awake, and would not, as they said ""Koffee Carry Carry has got very bad fetish.""

We are, therefore, very glad indeed to hear of a wise and praiseworthy step taken by Mr. Ussher, the present Administrator. He has dispatched Mr. Thomas Hughes, an educated African of Cape Coast, to the Assin country (also in the protectorate) to demand four Ashantees who are detained there as prisoners or captives. Prince Oso Ansah, of the royal family of Ashantee, who lately returned from the capital, Kumasi, with authentic intelligence of the death of King Quaco Duah, and the succession of Coffee Calcuary to the throne, is about to make another visit to the new King (who is about thirty-five years of age) and his other relatives at Kumasi, and it is intended that these released captives shall be sent back to Ashantee with him. Mr. Ussher will perform an important service if his measures lead to the re-establishment of friendly intercourse between the two countries; but we fear that it would not endure unless the British authorities put an end to the Awoonlah war troubles, because there is always a powerful war party in Ashantee which would be constantly looking with impatience toward those troubled Eastern Districts, and desire to fish in those perturbed waters.', 'last_edit_date': '1867-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1867#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Ashantee Peace Negotiations—Extradition of the Refugee Gaynin', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We inserted some months ago, on authority, that peace with Ashantee had been arranged and secured. It had, indeed, under the new aspect of affairs in the protected territories, consequent upon the late Ashantee war, the recommendations of the Parliamentary Committee and the resolves of the Colonial-office, become an _absolute duty_ on the part of Great Britain to arrive at such an understanding with the King of Ashantee as should serve to place the relations between Ashantee and the kingdoms and tribes in the protectorate on the same footing as they were before the war. England having determined that she would not in future take part in any campaign against the Ashantees further than by affording some advice, arms, and ammunition to the Fantees and other tribes of the protectorate who might be involved in war with that people, it became indispensable to put an end to all existing causes of quarrel, which might otherwise afford a reason or a pretext for a new invasion. During the last year of the late war, the natives in the protectorate maintained on all occasions that it was not a war between them and Ashantee, but was a white man\'s palaver—a dispute between the King of Ashantee and the Governor of Cape Coast, through whom they were involved in it. We presume that it is on this ground the present administration at Cape Coast, in endeavoring to bring about pacific relations with Ashantee has thought it right and proper to conduct the negotiations without making the kings and chiefs parties to them. The proceedings have, therefore, we suppose, been, as our correspondent states, ""shrouded in mystery;"" and it appears the peace negotiations have been more protracted than the chief authorities at Cape Coast Castle had anticipated. Since we made the publication above alluded to, accompanied with a copy of the official proclamation, messengers and messages have passed and repassed between Cape Coast and Comassie, the latest messenger who lately made his appearance on the coast having with him a retinue of 100 men. What could this mean? Colonel Conran was so secret in his words and resolves that not the smallest suspicion of the real state of affairs seems to have been entertained. Suddenly, however, one ""Gaynin"" was arrested and secured, and it was made known that he was to be sent off to Sierra Leone by the next mail steamer, which was subsequently effected. At Sierra Leone he was to be allowed 1s. 9d. per diem for subsistence. This ""Gaynin"" was the chief alleged cause of the Ashantee invasion. He was a subject of the King of Ashantee, accused of having appropriated to his own use a lump of gold, all lump gold belonging of right to the King. Summoned to Comassie to give an account of this, he believed his life to be in danger, and sought refuge at Cape Coast. The King of Ashantee demanded him; the Governor refused to give him up; other grievances raised their heads; and the war ensued so big with results for the protectorate. From what has now occurred, it appears that the King of Ashantee, with the obstinacy which characterises the sovereigns of that country, has continued to urge the surrender of ""Gaynin"" as the absolutely indispensable condition of peace relations. This has, no doubt, led to the proposal by the Administrator of a medium course, namely—that he should be sent away from Cape Coast, his presence there being offensive to his late sovereign. We presume, further, that this more moderate course has been acceptable to his Majesty of Ashantee, and think it extremely probable that, as our correspondents suggest, the envoy with his escort of 100 came to Cape Coast that he might assure his master of the fact of ""Gaynin"" having been embarked for Sierra Leone.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1866#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.697, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'From the Earl of Carnarvon to the Officer Administering the Government at Cape Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—I have received Lieut.-Colonel Maxwell\'s despatch of the 18th of March, submitting for the consideration of Her Majesty\'s Government the message delivered by the Embassy from the King of Ashanti after the ratification of the Treaty of Formanah on the 14th of March.\n\n2. In reply to the King\'s first question, I have to instruct you to inform him that as misunderstandings have already occurred with regard to the precise nature and conditions of the ""stipend"" formerly paid to him by the Dutch Government, and confirmed (at twice the original amount) by Mr. Hennessy on the occasion of the transfer, I am not able to advise the Queen to consent to the continuance of this payment on its old footing. But in consideration of the re-establishment of peace between Her Majesty and the King, and of his solemn promises of good behaviour for the future, the Queen contemplates sending to Kumasi, at no distant date, a special Embassy or Mission, which, if the King shall have faithfully adhered to the Treaty, will be charged with the delivery to him of some suitable present as marks of her\n\nRoyal favour and good-will. He will understand from this that Her Majesty is disposed to put aside all recollection of past hostilities, and for the future to treat him as a friend and ally, provided that his conduct is henceforward upright and straightforward, and in accordance with the Treaty obligations which he has undertaken.\n\n3. In answer to his second request, I have to desire that you will inform him that it is impossible for Her Majesty to direct the King of Adansi to return to his allegiance under the kingdom of Ashanti, as he did not renounce that allegiance at the suggestion or under the influence of the British Government, but, on the contrary, was informed that if he wished to join the Wassaws or Denkeras, it was an arrangement with which Her Majesty\'s Government could not interfere, and that the act must be understood to be purely voluntary on his part.\n\n4. In regard to the third request, I have to instruct you to inform him that Her Majesty\'s Government have no knowledge of the King of Eastern Akim having forcibly taken hostages from Ashanti towns, but that inquiry will be made and justice shall, as far as practicable, be done. Unless force has been used by the King of Eastern Akim to compel subjects of the King of Ashanti to renounce their allegiance, the Queen cannot interfere, nor can she direct the King of Akim to give up persons who have voluntarily thrown off their allegiance.\n\n5. With regard to the King\'s fourth request, I have to instruct you to inform him that I am unable even to lay it before the Queen.

The mission of these Envoys marks a stage in a series of negotiations. They are six in number, the chief amongst them being Prince A. A. Ossoo-Ansah, a son of Prince Ansah, who, in 1874, after the Ashanti War and the deposition of King Coffee, visited England for the purpose of clearing himself of imputations as to disloyalty to England during that war, and of obtaining compensation for the destruction of his property by the enemy. Prince Ossoo Ansah is the only one of the six who can speak English, and is appointed to act as interpreter and spokesman. The purpose of the visit has been stated in telegraphic despatches, but some fuller information is now available. It seems that the relations of Great Britain towards Ashanti have, with the sanction of the French Government, assumed somewhat new features, as it has been recognised as falling within the British sphere of influence. With the increased assurance of protection thus afforded, British traders have extended their operations in the country, which is extremely fertile in general produce, and especially rich in gold. The Governor of Cape Coast Castle, Sir W. Brandford Griffith, has consequently been led to propose the extension of British authority in a more formal manner—the establishment of a British Resident at the capital, Coomassie (or Kumasi). This step having been taken, the next would naturally be the definite conversion of the country into a British Protectorate. But to this idea a considerable number of the Natives have expressed the most decided objection; and it is with the idea of expressing the popular feeling upon this point that these six ""ambassadors"" have been appointed with the intention that they should seek an interview with the Queen, and lay before her Majesty the reasons why such a course would be so unpopular among their people.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-05-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_05_1895#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE ASHANTI ENVOYS IN ENGLAND.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—The Ashanti Ambassador has consulted me in reference to the various articles appearing in the Press touching on this subject, and he has requested me in fairness to ask that you will permit me to make some comment thereon inasmuch as the English version of the matter has alone been presented to the public. There appears to be some foundation for believing that a military expedition has been sent to Coomassie, or is about to be, for the purposes of compelling the King of Ashanti to accept a British Resident at his capital, whether the same be just, expedient, or otherwise. It is but fair (and Englishmen always boast of their fairness) that our Government and the King of Ashanti should have the like opportunities of putting their case before the British public, although I am aware that the public Press is not exactly the constitutional medium generally appealed to. The Ambassadors, however, are in London, and having appealed to the Government for a hearing (which has been refused), they can but now appeal to the Press for the ventilation of their alleged grievances—the more especially as I understand that the British Government are not slow on occasions to recognise that as a correct medium. According to my instructions, it would appear that Prempeh was not elected to the stool of Ashanti by us, so much so that we refused to interfere with the Ashantees\' selection at all, but fully recognised their action by having present our official representative at the coronation, and acknowledged him as King of Ashanti. There cannot be any manner of doubt about this, as it is borne out by the Blue records from 1888 to 1894. I am also told that when the British Government submitted the proposal that a British Resident should be received, the King was correctly designated by us as ""King of Ashanti,"" although at that time we were aware of the fact now alleged that ""the old Ashanti Confederation"" has been broken up""—a confederation which, I am instructed, had never existed. My clients emphatically deny that the King has ever broken or violated any of his treaty engagements. They deny, too, that he has countenanced human sacrifice, a fact which I am told is negatived by our own records; nor has he, it is urged, hampered trade and attacked tribes under British protection. It is also denied that he has raided for slaves. On the contrary, my clients inform me that the King has cause to complain of want of frankness towards him, and that our representative in the Gold Coast, while professing friendship towards the King, has, as a fact, been acting contrary to his pledges. The King is prepared to open his country to British skill, and does not seek to hamper trade as is suggested. The Ambassadors submit that the fact of Ashanti being ""within the sphere of British influence"" does not carry away the King\'s independence as a sovereign, nor justify the hostile attitude our Government are assuming. That the King is an independent sovereign, there cannot be any question in the face of the reply of the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, given in February last, and if England claims the right to send a mission to the King whenever she feels inclined, my clients urge that the same privilege should be extended to their King when he is acting with bona fides and in the honest belief that he is acting within his rights. The mission have travelled some thousands of miles to discuss the position and treat with her Majesty\'s advisers, and if only on the grounds of fair play, and apart from any precedent, the Government could receive them, there certainly would not be any particle of reason why one ounce of blood should be shed.

It was a man with one hand secured by a piece of iron to an enormous log, which he had to drag with him. His legs were also manacled together. He was one of the Fantee prisoners, more than fifty of whom had been released the night before. He said that he had been imprisoned some way off, but had managed to creep so far, travelling all night, at the pace of a snail, and suffering great pain. His legs were bleeding and covered with flies. My servant and I worked for some time to get him free, and I saw in the distance a Houssa soldier, whom I called, and who also joined in our efforts. At last three Fantees came up and unfettered him by means of a knife and a stone with much dexterity. They had all been prisoners, being captured while peaceably trading at Fommanah. One of them could speak English.\n\nSome one discovered to-day a very curious document, being the journal of a Fantee prisoner at Kumasi, during the last two weeks. He heard on January 23, that Captain Glover had won a victory. On the 24th, an Ashantee prince was recalled from banishment. The 25th was some Ashantee festival, and the King went, according to custom, to pour libations to the spirits of his ancestors.

He could not return to his master, the King of Ashanti, nor can the brother. He would also rather die at this place. Knowing this, we can easily find why these recent disturbances arose. The mere eating of fetish for an oath by the Accras and Djuabins, on the arrival of the latter at Accra—a law or practice observed for so very many years, and recognized by the preceding Governors as a custom of the protectorate kings and chiefs, with foreigners who seek to lodge in the protectorate as friends—was misrepresented to Governor Freeling as a scheme and plot inciting to war with the Ashantees, for which every now and then these poor harmless personages were disgracefully troubled. We, of course, greatly blame the Downing-street authorities for sending out as officers men of the stuff daily imported into this country, who will not afford to be at their own expense here for their meals and drink, but board on others, to save their salaries to spend when at home; which renders them, whatever may be their rank and position, mere tools in the hands of such natives as Mr. —, men who, but only for the advantages of education, are not worthy the names they bear, having neither principle nor character. The real facts out of which the recent disturbances upon which those poor kings were arrested and transported arose are the following. Some time ago a case came on before his Honour Chief Justice Marshall, being a charge by one Djuabin man, named Owoosoo Brempong, against the late Affraocma, the daughter of Assafo Adjaye, known as the Djuabin Queen, of extortion of money, say 37£. odd. The cause of the charge was this: during the time the late Queen was imprisoned at Elmina, this Owoosoo Brempong's wife, by name Accosiea, who was living with her at Elmina, was seduced by a man called Quamin Frempong, whom the Queen called her husband. On the Queen hearing this, she sent to the husband of that woman for satisfaction, alleging that his wife had no right to be known by her husband. This money was paid, nolens volens, by Owoosoo Brempong; but on the return of both Assafo Adjaye and the Queen to Accra, the man appealed against the Queen and claimed the money back. Assafo Adjaye investigated the matter, and pronouncing the Queen wrong, he ordered her to refund the amount and drive the ragamuffin Frempong from her residence. The Queen disobeyed the order. The appellant sued her in the Supreme Court, and obtained judgment; but she would not obey the order of the Court, and plotted with Mr. — to deprive her father of the Royal stool, she claiming to be the lawful owner. Why our poor lamented Mr. Ussher so much interested himself in such a scandalous matter as to have brought it to this crisis, God knows; but to us it appears in every wise similar to the case of King Herod and the daughter of Herodias. Governor Ussher promised her “whatsoever she would ask of him”; and her own father Assafo Adjaye's head was what she demanded. She made a complaint to Governor Ussher that her father was conspiring with the Djuabins against her, and therefore she must have the stool from him. Adjaye maintained that he held the stool from his father and the country for life. Governor Ussher sent for the people from the bush, a place called Konfroduah and Acuapin, for the purpose. The people confirmed the statement of Adjaye. Governor Ussher got puzzled; told Adjaye and the daughter to go and have the matter settled before their own people. When they came from the Castle, the Queen refused to listen to anything but the stool being given up to her. Adjaye, however, thinking that the case could not be settled except they had disinterested people among them to determine the case, asked King Tackie to settle it for them. King Tackie gave notice to the Queen to attend on Wednesday, the 14th of October last. When the King and all the people met, she was sent for, having been notified the previous evening; but she asked for advice from the before-mentioned Mr. —, whose practice and aims in respect of the Djuabins' well-being in the protectorate I have already mentioned. He advised her not to attend, and wrote to her that he was going to give information to the Governor. Upon that information, King Tackie was at once apprehended and lodged in Ussher's Fort, at which place, my friend, your informant, stated the rough element of Accra intended to attempt a rescue at night; while King Tackie has been thus imprisoned—why, God knows!"", 'last_edit_date': '1881-02-14', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1881#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Transported and Imprisoned Kings', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The most sacred portion of the duty of a free press is to strive to remedy injustice and wrong.

Some changes that have taken place at the Gambia, attributed to our efforts, are encouraging, as evidencing that the ear and judgment of the present Chief of the Colonial Office, the Earl of Kimberley, are not entirely monopolized by officialism; and in ruminating on the letter which we inserted in our last number, headed ""The African Kings Transported by the late Governor Ussher,"" we have ventured to indulge the hope that if the noble Secretary of State for the Colonies will only admit that the decisions and acts of the Governors of Crown Colonies are not infallible, we may yet obtain some atonement for injustice to some deeply injured persons.

As such, it touches us nearly, and incites us to persistent action, seeing that we have now in office in England a Government bold and courageous in the cause of right, as evidenced in what they have recently done in the matter of the Transvaal, which no one in his senses could doubt the power of Great Britain to subdue and retain had she so determined.

Though Benin had signed a treaty of protection with the British in 1892, she none the less guarded her sovereignty with determination. This, of course, would not be tolerated in that age, and using the killing of the British acting consul-general and five other Englishmen on their way to Benin as an excuse, the British launched a punitive expedition of 1500 men against Benin in 1897. Though the Oba himself would have liked to submit, a majority of his chiefs raised an army to beat back the invasion. They were, however, defeated and the capital was looted of its precious bronze treasures and then burnt. 48 In the Niger Delta, as in many other areas of Nigeria, the British had signed treaties of protection with most of the chiefs by 1884. However, while some, like Calabar and Bonny, had allowed missionaries to operate in their states, others had not. Moreover, all of them were insisting on their sovereign rights to regulate trade and to levy duties on British traders. This, the new British consuls, such as Hewett and Johnston, would not tolerate. A typical example of the rulers who stood up to the British consuls and missionaries was Jaja of Opobo (see Plate 6.3). He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order. When Jaja still refused to comply in spite of Johnston's threats to bombard his town with British gunboats, Johnston enticed Jaja on board a ship in 1887 under a promise of safeconduct but arrested him and sent him to Accra$^{49}$ where he was tried and deported to the West Indies.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century.

The Benin kingdom began to feel the embarrassment of this development when its trading privileges in the coastal trade, especially its control over the com¬ merce on the Benin river in the western Niger delta, came to be challenged by European traders, mostly British, and the African middlemen, especially the Itsekiri and the Ijo. The eclipse of the Benin port of Ughoton dem¬ onstrated quite painfully to Benin that the days of its near monopoly of coastal trade had ended.\nThe coastal trade encouraged the spirit of political autonomy among the Itsekiri. This eventually led to a situation of war between the Olu of Warri and the qba of Benin, and the new wealth also nourished political conflicts within the Warri kingdom itself. There was, for example, so much rivalry and acrimony, so many succession disputes, protest migrations and the setting up of autonomous and rival power centres that for the rest of the century no generally acceptable successor could be found for the stool of the Olu of Warri when Akengbua, the incumbent from 1809, died in 1848. As with the Itsekiri kingdom, Agbor, whose monarchy had also been organized on the Benin model and operated as a Benin dependency, grew steadily into an autonomous state again largely under the influence of the new coastal trade. Ovonramwen, the last Oba of independent Benin, was determined to reinvigorate the kingdom and this policy included an expedition against Agbor with a view to re-asserting Benin authority there.

The amir, though the original appointee and 'flag-bearer', was still only the first among equals; in some cases there was more than one 'flag-bearer' in a territory, while in other cases the original appointee proved too weak to assert his authority.

Subsequent events, however, soon occurred which showed that the hope was too sanguine, and that the Duke Town despots were too fond of cutting off ears and similar barbarities to relinquish them, even for a stern treaty. When the Duke Town tyrants heard that good Consul Hopkins died, they rejoiced and said, ""It be good thing them Consul be gone, he be too strong for we Calabar people."" ""The treaty he made with us be dead too. Ofou, it is good! Ofou, it is good!"" Thousands of natives, who looked up to him as their father and protector, bewailed his death very much, and pray for a successor like him.\n\nA month or two ago, appalling atrocities, too revolting to be mentioned, were committed in the vicinity of Duke Town by Egbo men or rulers. The well-doing natives in Old Calabar petitioned the Foreign Office in regard to these barbarities, and received a courteous reply that instructions had been issued, calling the attention of the commanders of gunboats cruising in the neighbourhood to the atrocities committed in the Calabar River. For this considerate reply, and for former good deeds performed in Calabar at the request of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the hearty thanks of both Europeans and natives are due to the Foreign Office. In November last, a chief in town and an elder in the church died; previous to his death he made a will, and appointed the resident missionaries as his executors. When Orok, alias Duke Ephraim, heard of the will, he was indignant, and threatened to appropriate his people as well as his goods if any European dared to interfere with him. The ground on which this avaricious man claimed the property of the deceased was that he was an acquaintance of his grandfather. During the night, Orok and the ex-Queen went to the house of the late George Duke, and carried off a quantity of goods. A very unseemly action for an ex-Queen, and an eager aspirant to the kingship of Duke Town,—the robbing of widows and fatherless children.\n\nThis same man, a year ago, cut off the ears of one of his young wives four days after giving birth to her first-born; she died from the effects of this cruelty. He also attempted two years ago to open up a new quarrel with Henshaw Town, because a Henshaw Town man, while passing his yard, left a bag near it.

In 1885 differences existed in the kingdom of Baddiboo, a country which, under favourable circumstances, contributes greatly to the prosperity of Gambia, because it grows the staple product of the settlement—ground nuts. The Baddiboo war, in conjunction with the simultaneous depression in the value of this staple, produced a disastrous decline in the revenue of Gambia, and therefore special efforts were made to bring about a settlement of the difficulty. After prolonged negotiations the Acting Administrator arranged a basis of peace, and the two rival chiefs, Beram Ceasey and Saide Mattie, signed treaties with the Government of Gambia in 1887, guaranteeing to stop the war, and to engage in no further hostilities without reference to the Governor at Bathurst.\n\nFor a short time matters went on satisfactorily, and preparations to cultivate Baddiboo were being renewed, when, unhappily, Saide Mattie, in opposition to the emphatic advice of the Administrator, persisted in going to the adjoining kingdom of Saloum to obtain redress for some wrong, imaginary or real, committed by the King of that country against him. Soon after the treaty was signed he proceeded with a strong contingent of his army to Saloum. The latter chief sought assistance from the French, who espoused his cause and warned Saide Mattie to return to Baddiboo. He was, however, defiant, and a fight ensued in which he and his army were utterly routed and driven back. They were pursued and dispersed, and Saide Mattie, seeing that all was over, took refuge in Albareda, and laid down his arms at the English Governor's request. He consented to go to the English settlement at Bathurst, and there he has remained ever since.\n\nThe difference made by a tribal war of this kind in the trade of the settlements on the adjacent coasts is shown by the circumstance that the trade of Gambia in ground nuts, which, in 1883, prior to the Baddiboo war, amounted to over 23,000 tons, had fallen in 1887 to less than 3,000.

What does concern us is the destruction of Onitsha, and its results. Onitsha seemed to be inseparably identified in our mind with the redemption of the Niger countries from barbarism, and the growth of a healthy commerce in them. Situate at the confluence of the Tchudda with the Niger, on ground ceded to the British at the time of Prince Albert's celebrated and unfortunate expedition, it has been the centre of missionary action, as well as of trading operations; and now, by its destruction the native catechists and missionaries must be scattered, and the work of twenty-two years, during which time the Church of England Mission had been established there, be brought to a deadlock. And it does cause us serious reflection that so important and extreme a decision as that of the destruction of that cradle of Niger civilization, should have been arrived at so soon after the death of the late lamented Consul Hopkins. If the iniquities of Onitsha had become so flagrant during Consul Hopkins' life as to have justified such severe punishment, we cannot believe that Consul Hopkins would have allowed them to go unpunished; while the time that has intervened since his lamented death is too short to have allowed an extraordinary new growth of iniquity. We cannot, therefore, believe that had Consul Hopkins been still exercising authority in those countries, he would have permitted the violence that has been employed; and we do think that where power has been so excessively, ruthlessly, and carelessly used, it is imperatively necessary that we should be made acquainted with the justifying cause of such an exercise of force.

By his unaided exertions he frequently restored and maintained peace among the disputing chiefs of the Coast. His last duty was a journey to New Calabar, where his presence, we are told, \'caused the conflict between the native chiefs and their followers to cease, and a palaver to take place to settle the existing differences.\' Mr. Hopkins\'s influence with the natives was proverbial, and the name of \'King-maker\' was not inaptly given him by traders in the district, for in the election of chiefs his voice was all-powerful. At the time of the Ashanti difficulty Mr. Hopkins offered to assist Sir Garnet Wolseley with a drilled body of five hundred men from Bonny, while both Commander Cameron and Mr. Stanley have to thank him for valuable assistance during their travels. Mr. Consul Hopkins owed his position, such as it was, entirely to himself, and his heart was so much in his work that he chose to brave the deadly climate year after year rather than relinquish his post. How he came to receive the appointment was never very clear, but as he was about the only British resident to be found on the spot, the choice was not difficult to make. Mr. Hopkins some years ago held a temporary appointment under the War Office, but, failing to pass the prescribed examination for a clerkship, was cut adrift from official employment. He was a crack shot with the rifle, and his name figures frequently as a prize-winner at the earlier Wimbledon meetings; he was indeed the first captain of the Irish team. Subsequently he entered into an engagement with a trading company to proceed to the West Coast, and here his skill as a marksman brought him the respect of the natives far and wide. Within a few years of his rejection by the Civil Service Commissioners as incompetent, as possibly he was, to perform the duties of a War Office clerk, we hear of him saluted by the guns of the squadron as British Consul, and proceeding in company with a gunboat to settle some dispute between quarrelsome chiefs on the subject of palm oil or ivory.

European abolitionists found, for example, that to stop the slave trade and the wars in the interior, they had to reckon not just with the coastal rulers but also with the different power bases in the interior. Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome. Similarly, British peace› makers involved in resolving aspects of nineteenth-century Yoruba warfare had to travel virtually throughout the length and breadth of the culture area.\nUnfortunately, the European approach was divisive, tending towards politically structured differentiation. This was already noticeable in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era. British interests came to be specifically protected visà-vis the interest of other European nationals; British interests were also advanced against those of Africans. We have already drawn attention to the penetration of the Benin kingdom from the Niger delta and the resultant whittling down of Benin's trading hinterland to the extent of the eventual abandonment of Ughoton, Benin's traditional port.

The inter-state wars did not weaken the resolve of each of the states to keep European traders from encroaching on their spheres of trade or in the maintenance of their sovereignty. The British had clashed with King William Pepple of Bonny as early as 1854, when they exiled him to Fernando Po, Ascension, Sierra Leone and London. They used disturbances caused by local feuds as an excuse. In 1887 they could find no such excuse when they removed Jaja of Opobo for his opposition to direct British trade in the Imo river valley. The rulers of Nembe (Brass), lying on the main Nun estuary of the Niger, were involved in quarrels between exploring and trading British expeditions and local peoples from the 1830s when British citizens got killed or shot at. The final showdown came in 1895, when the Nembe attacked the major depot of the Royal Niger Company at the port of Akassa and destroyed it. This was in protest against the Company's attempt to establish monopoly trade all the way up from Akassa in the delta to Lokoja at the Niger-Benue confluence. Also in 1898, King Ibanichuka of Okrika was seized by the British consul for his refusal to take orders from the new British Protectorate government of Southern Nigeria.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey.

The tensions reached such a pitch that Boshof was forced into a tactical resignation in February 1858 and, when he withdrew his resignation, several members of the volksraad left in protest. Coupled with the internal disputes were the increasing border quarrels with Lesotho. Boshof decided to check the border disputes by invading Lesotho in March 1858. By converging on Thaba Bosiu, Moshoeshoe's stronghold, the Boer commandos left their rear exposed, which was then raided by the Lesotho army. The Boers abandoned the struggle as they went back home to defend their families and property.

Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction.

Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

This visit has been contemplated some time, but has been retarded by the Governor's illness and the hesitation of the Bashorun and elders to receive him. A person of colour who conceives himself to have been injured by some former acts of the Governor has for months past been staying in Abeokuta, exerting all his influence to prevent a rapprochement between the authorities of the two places, whose interests are so closely united.

My own impression is that the Egbas will be only too glad to listen to the Governor's overtures, and that, being tired of the long stoppage of trade, they will avail themselves of any good excuse to open the roads and let our produce come down. Bad counsels may, however, prevail over their own better intentions, or their easy victory over Dahomey may have further inflated them.

They forget the fact that a wound which can be inflicted in a moment cannot be healed for a long time. I state it as an indisputable fact which can bear any test of investigation, that Captain Glover, during the period of his administration of the government of this settlement (from 1863 to 1872), managed to inflict such serious political wounds on the minds of the Egbas and Ijebus, that it is surprising he and his friends should expect those wounds to be healed in the very short time in which Governor Hennessy tried to heal them. Happily for Lagos Lord Kimberley sent out Governor Hennessy at the time he did; otherwise I cannot say how serious the state of things in Lagos would have become.

We then expressed a hope that ere this we should hear of another Dahoman defeat by the Egbas. This hope has not been realized; but we have news of the retirement of the Dahomans, without their having ventured any attack on the town. We presume, therefore, that they have returned to their own blood-stained land with fresh hordes of victims for those cruel annual customs in which both King and people take a childish and savage delight. This confirms our impression that, notwithstanding the vain glorious boasting, and annual threats and promises made during the progress of those customs, they have arrived at a full consciousness of their inability ever to force an entry into the town which they have so often during their orgies devoted to slaughter and destruction. The Dahomans cannot take Abeokuta; that is clear. But, unhappily, another thing is equally clear, and that is, the Egbas have not sufficient dependence on themselves, in conflict with the Dahomans in open country, to induce them to take the offensive against the invaders, in the hope that by inflicting a severe chastisement they might destroy their power and appetite for further devastating and panyaring inroads. This is greatly to be deplored. Many years ago we expressed our sorrow at so unsatisfactory a state of things. When Great Britain annexed Lagos, we entertained the hope that, among the advantages which the Egbas would derive from that annexation, the putting an end to those Dahoman raids within their territory would be one. It ought to have been one. The powerful and the wise ought to have so conciliated the ignorant and the weak, as to bring about such friendly relations that in attacking the one, the Dahomans should have known they were incurring the displeasure of the other. This was one of the results of annexation that we desired and expected. When we saw, at a later period, that not only had this not been effected, but that a disastrous bitterness and distrust marked all their relations, we strongly insisted, with those whom we then believed to have influence in Abeokuta, that the Egbas should steadily and diligently strive, by adopting, to a certain extent, an armament superior to that of the Dahomans, and becoming proficient in their use of the weapons, to raise themselves to a military condition that should enable them, in the event of further Dahoman inroads, to effect the destruction of their bitter and relentless foes. We did not think it at all necessary that the great bulk of the people should have arms of precision, and know how to use them; but only that some two or three thousand of them should be armed with Sniders; and be made so fully to understand and to command the capabilities of the weapon, that it could not fail to beget in them a feeling of invincibility as regards the brave but undisciplined and ill-armed Dahomans. We fully believe that had the advice been followed, the end we had in view would have been attained. The effects produced by the employment of similar arms, even in the hands of native Africans, against the Ashantees during the late war fully confirm us in the belief that we were correct in that view. We repeat the advice we before gave. We feel a great interest in the Egbas.

The Ibadans tried to buy grog instead of rum or gin, as the Ijebus and Egbas water it so much that the purchaser scarcely gets 12 degrees spirit, and selling pieces of cloth 25 yards instead of 30, and so on. But, above all, some time ago they refused to sell them salt, powder, guns, &c., which is a sign of hostility; so much so, that Mr. Editor will remember that that was the quarrel of the Egbas with Captain Glover, when he stopped powder and guns against them in 1871-72. All this is almost nothing in comparison to others. In 1872-73, I was in Abbeokuta, when Chief Warrior Akodu sent to Kobits (Abbeokuta is a big market in the middle town) to take and plunder Ibadan people several times; once it met me in the very Kobite; and these Ibadans he used to chain and sell with their goods plundered. Once Oguée, another war chief (for there are thousands of them in Abb) plundered and caught several Ibadans, in the midst of whom was a woman with child. As Oguée knew that this trick would be discovered, and that he shared with nobody the plundered goods, consequently had no backstay as Akodu, he took these poor people and killed them all. The Egbas used to pass through Ibadan to Ilorin with thousands of pounds worth of goods, but the Ibadans never troubled them; the poor Ibadan people come to Abbeokuta with a single bag of kernal or bag of seed cotton to buy a bag of salt, are captured, and sold at once by the peaceable Egba. Can a gentleman like Mr. H. Robbin, though of Egba pure blood, as I am, deny this? As a gentleman, I trust he will speak the truth. Every day, similar plunders of the Ibadans by the peaceable Egba occurred, till lately one War chief, called Ajagunjungun, plundered some Ibadans\' property; they begged and begged, but with no result. Chief Ogundipe interceded and opposed, though himself an Egba and heathen; never joining them nor approving their doings, as Mr. ""Native"" and others do. Tired of their going and coming, the Ibadans sent to their King Alafin (King of all the Yorubas) to intercede for them. The King of Oyo (Alafin), knowing how stubborn are the Egbas, sent Sango-fetish (Thunder-god), with his messenger, to the Egbas, begging them, through Sango, which, according to heathenism, is the most solemn request; but the Egbas refused (or Ajagaujeuru), for any single Egba is a king, a chief, an all in all. The Ibadans then determined not to go to Abbeokuta again for commerce, as they say in their own language, ""they want no neighbourhood war in future after the Ijaye war""; so they sent to the King of Porto Novo to tell him (with Alafin messenger) that they would pass through Imeko to his country, to buy their necessaries. In this message there were Royal gifts on both sides, and rejoicings by the King of Porto Novo, who wants to be freed from the Egbas, for all the neighbourhood is against the Egbas. Perhaps Mr. ""Native"" will point out to me who are the Egbas\' friends in this part of Africa but England; and they have well paid them (five days from date will make ten years since). On the return of the Ibadans, the Egbas sent a chief warrior, called Ogundeyi, to plunder them, but Ogundeyi being a coward, as all the Egba war-chiefs are, hid himself in the bush till the Ibadans went away, and then told the Egbas that he did not find them. Of course they all knew it well, but dare not say it, as none are able to do more. So the Egbas blockaded their roads against Ogundeyi\'s wish, and sent to the King of Ijebu (with flattering words, such as ""you are our father,"" of our all and all"") to do the like as they have done in 1872 against Lagos. All the Ibadans then could not help but to show the Egbas that they are men, and even not so coward as the Egbas, declared war against them, not against the Ijebus, until the Ijebus provoke them; '}]","[{'document_title': 'Address of the Egbas at Bathurst to their Friends in Abeokuta', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We, the undersigned Egbas by descent, now located at Bathurst Town, St. Mary's River, Gambia, to the Chiefs, our brethren, countrymen, &c., bearing rule at Abeokuta, greeting:—\n\nWe cordially and sincerely wish you all grace and peace from God our Father, and his Son Jesus Christ.\n\nWhereas we have been informed, from undoubted and good authorities, that you, our beloved countrymen at Abeokuta, have recently been involved in quarrels with the British Government, and are ready to take up arms against them.\n\nWe, therefore, anticipating the dismal calamities, misfortunes, and distress that will inevitably result upon our nation from this quarrel, deem it an indispensable duty of sincere and affectionate brethren seasonably to interfere; and hope, by God's grace, to prevail on you with wholesome advice, in order that a stop might speedily be put to these impending and approaching evils.

If, as stated, the only desire of the Ibadans is to procure constant and abundant supplies of arms and ammunition, not for self-defence, but for wars of aggression and conquest, and with the fixed intention and hope of ultimately destroying Abeokuta; we think it should be a matter for serious consideration by the British authorities at Lagos, whether in the interests, not only of Lagos as the great seaport of those countries, but in the also of the whole population of the Egba and Yoruba territories, they should not adopt a decided policy for the maintenance of peace, and make that policy known to all the parties interested. Lagos cannot be advantaged in any way by the destruction of the Egbas by the Ibadans. Every attack by the Ibadans on the Egba farms is an attack on the prosperity of Lagos. It seems to us, therefore, that the time has come when the Government at Lagos should notify to the chiefs and people at Ibadan that all unprovoked attacks by the latter on the Egba farms; and all attempts against the territorial integrity of Abeokuta, will be not only displeasing to the government at Lagos, but will, if persisted in, be at length regarded as acts of hostility against Lagos itself; that in an unprovoked war of aggression by Ibadan upon Abeokuta, the latter would, in case of necessity, be assisted by Her Majesty\'s Government at Lagos. It is surely time that the Queen\'s Government at Lagos should exercise its just influence in interior disputes that so gravely compromise those commercial interests on the prosperity of which that of Lagos itself depends. The key-note of civilization, peace, and prosperity in those countries must be sounded from Lagos; and it is not worthy in a Government carried on there in the name of the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, that this key-note should be only so faintly struck as to be, as it has hitherto been, scarcely audible. That Government must adopt a policy distinct, stable, enlightened, and understood by the interior peoples. We do not see any secure basis on which such a policy can be founded and built up, but that of peace, friendship, and goodwill with and towards Abeokuta, and the promise of efficient aid to the latter, if necessary, in the event of unprovoked attack from Ibadan. Her Majesty\'s Government has remonstrated with the King of Dahomey as regards his oft-repeated attacks upon Abeokuta, one at least of which would seem to have been made by direct invitation of Ibadan; and it will only be a carrying out of the same policy to make similar remonstrances with the latter. If there be a perfectly friendly understanding with Abeokuta on the part of the Lagos government, with a frank declaration of such a policy as we have pointed to, we cannot believe that there would be any difficulty in arranging the question of transit dues between Abeokuta and Ibadan. If, as asserted, the objection on the part of the Egbas to force intercourse on the part of the Yorubas with Lagos, is one derived from the natural instinct of self-preservation, that objection will disappear when once Abeokuta becomes assured that, let Ibadan import whatever quantity of arms and ammunition she may, she will not be permitted to use them for despoiling and destroying Abeokuta. We should then also hope to see a perfect and entire accord between the Lagos Government and the Egba authorities for improving the land communications of Abeokuta with Lagos. The distance between the two places ought to be accomplished within the short space of a few hours, both for passengers and goods. Then, and never until then, will the Egba countries make that progress which such fertile countries, inhabited by so industrial a population, ought to make. All our views, aims, and desires concerning them, since Lagos became a possession of the British Crown, have been in this direction; and we yet hope to see them realized. It will appear at once, to all who are interested in the discussion and settlement of matters so vital as regards the commercial prosperity of Lagos, that the Porto Novo Question cannot be overlooked. It is time it was settled in the way desired by the enlightened portion of the Lagos community, native and European. The supplies of ammunition which enabled the Ibadans to commence their late raids in Abeokuta territory—raids, which we rejoice to hear, have, in many instances, been vigorously repulsed—were obtained from Porto Novo by a large armed body of Ibadans, who, either with the connivance, or because of the small power of resistance of the king of that place, plundered the stores of English and other merchants of all that they chose to require. The present efforts of the Ibadans to make a road of their own through Egba territory to Porto Novo, are efforts to enable them to repeat that plundering operation whenever their marauding necessities may require fresh supplies. We showed, some months ago, in a leading article in our journal, how indispensable it had now become that Porto Novo should be united with Lagos under British government; and the conviction then expressed could only be confirmed by the fact of the persistent attacks of the Ibadans on Egba farms lying on the line of their coveted road to Porto Novo. They would no longer have the same object in making, or desiring to make this road if Porto Novo and Lagos were under the same rule—a rule which has both the will and the power to prevent such depredations as those committed by the Ibadans in Porto Novo. We cannot doubt that the annexation of Porto Novo by amicable contract and arrangement with the Native authority of that place is under the consideration of Her Majesty\'s Government, who must feel the same desire that we do, that the enormities there practised should be put an end to, as well as that British property there should be freed from its present proved liability to plunder. Having ""put their hand to the plough"" in the annexation of Lagos, which, notwithstanding the occasional errors of its local government, has put an end to very great evils, and brought in a very great amount of good, they ought not now to draw back or hesitate when, as in the matter of Porto Novo, the need is so pressing, and the interests of humanity and civilizing commerce alike demand their immediate action.', 'last_edit_date': '1878-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1878#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.634, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Affairs on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Just before leaving England last year you asked me for some information in reference to some reports regarding Abeokuta. I have recently returned from another visit to West Africa, during which I have again been to Abeokuta. At present the authorities there have no intention to grant any favour to the prejudice of British interests; but I think something more should be done to attach the natives of the interior to our Government. Whether deserved or not we have a reputation of being slow and supine. The Egbas (the people of Abeokuta) are sometimes tempted to act unpleasantly towards us. There is a disaffected section in the community, by whom the loyal chiefs are occasionally harassed. On the occasion of my last visit to Abeokuta, last April, intelligence had arrived respecting the Dahomian attack on Porto Novo. It was currently reported that the English had secretly connived with the Dahomians, and an attempt was made to raise an ante-English demonstration. On April 7 important deliberations were conducted by the authorities. Ebullitions of anger were here and there displayed, and an attack was expected. However, the cloud passed off, and the ground of this suspicion appeared to be that an influential Dahomian prince had been for some weeks residing in Lagos. On this occasion I was returning from a tour through the Yaruba country. The region through which I travelled was in a state of great unrest. At Jubu Ode the King and chiefs expressed their vexation over the interminable Ibadan and Ilorin, which are sadly interfering with trade. The Ibadans, while prolonging their strife with Ilorin, are also troubled with the Egbas raiding their farms. The relations between Ibadan and Oyo are in a condition of extreme tension. At Ogbomosho complaints were loud on account of the spoliation of their farms by the Ilorians, with kidnapping and occasional slaughter. Within the last few years thirteen Yaruba towns have been destroyed by the Dahomians, and seven towns were destroyed last year. From what I can gather these towns have about 4,000 inhabitants, while several were much larger. In my journey I passed through the ruins of some of the towns which, a few years ago, were large and influential centres of population and commerce, notably Ijayi and Biolorun Pellu. It would be an unspeakable mercy if some benevolent civilised Power could interfere to cause the chronic strife to cease, and develop the riches of the country. After getting some fifty or sixty miles from the coast the country is comparatively healthy and fertile, as the plantations of cotton, indigo, &c., show, and in some parts rich in mineral treasure. I saw several iron pits and smelting furnaces, and have specimens of iron ore by me. I availed myself of the opportunities afforded me in interviews with kings and chiefs to urge on them the necessity of peace and industry, and was received with welcome wherever I went in the Yaruba country. The reply of one chief was remarkable. He said, “You tell us how much we should be advantaged if we would abandon our quarrels and unite for strength and prosperity. Your words are true; but we are like children fighting. Each is ashamed to be the first to stop, but both wish for nothing better than for some strong man to step between us and send us away to do something wiser.”', 'last_edit_date': '1889-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1889#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.637, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Egbas and Ibadans', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We are informed that the interior tribes have sent to both the Egbas and Ibadans to make known their desire that the matter between them shall be amicably settled without fighting.

The Ibadans had determined to fight, and said that even if the Jebus attacked them they would not fight with them, because their properties and persons have always been safe with the Jebus; while on the contrary, the Egbas have laid wait for and kidnapped their people, robbed them of their goods, and sold them into slavery, for which they have never been able to obtain redress. They demand that the Egbas should either accept a consul from Ibadan to reside at Abeokuta, and watch over the Ibadan interests, in the same way that a consul of Jebu has resided for many years past in Ibadan; or receive a British consul in Abeokuta, who would watch over the interests of both Egbas and Ibadans, and settle all disputes between them.

The Ibadans tried to buy grog instead of rum or gin, as the Ijebus and Egbas water it so much that the purchaser scarcely gets 12 degrees spirit, and selling pieces of cloth 25 yards instead of 30, and so on. But, above all, some time ago they refused to sell them salt, powder, guns, &c., which is a sign of hostility; so much so, that Mr. Editor will remember that that was the quarrel of the Egbas with Captain Glover, when he stopped powder and guns against them in 1871-72. All this is almost nothing in comparison to others. In 1872-73, I was in Abbeokuta, when Chief Warrior Akodu sent to Kobits (Abbeokuta is a big market in the middle town) to take and plunder Ibadan people several times; once it met me in the very Kobite; and these Ibadans he used to chain and sell with their goods plundered. Once Oguée, another war chief (for there are thousands of them in Abb) plundered and caught several Ibadans, in the midst of whom was a woman with child. As Oguée knew that this trick would be discovered, and that he shared with nobody the plundered goods, consequently had no backstay as Akodu, he took these poor people and killed them all. The Egbas used to pass through Ibadan to Ilorin with thousands of pounds worth of goods, but the Ibadans never troubled them; the poor Ibadan people come to Abbeokuta with a single bag of kernal or bag of seed cotton to buy a bag of salt, are captured, and sold at once by the peaceable Egba. Can a gentleman like Mr. H. Robbin, though of Egba pure blood, as I am, deny this? As a gentleman, I trust he will speak the truth. Every day, similar plunders of the Ibadans by the peaceable Egba occurred, till lately one War chief, called Ajagunjungun, plundered some Ibadans\' property; they begged and begged, but with no result. Chief Ogundipe interceded and opposed, though himself an Egba and heathen; never joining them nor approving their doings, as Mr. ""Native"" and others do. Tired of their going and coming, the Ibadans sent to their King Alafin (King of all the Yorubas) to intercede for them. The King of Oyo (Alafin), knowing how stubborn are the Egbas, sent Sango-fetish (Thunder-god), with his messenger, to the Egbas, begging them, through Sango, which, according to heathenism, is the most solemn request; but the Egbas refused (or Ajagaujeuru), for any single Egba is a king, a chief, an all in all. The Ibadans then determined not to go to Abbeokuta again for commerce, as they say in their own language, ""they want no neighbourhood war in future after the Ijaye war""; so they sent to the King of Porto Novo to tell him (with Alafin messenger) that they would pass through Imeko to his country, to buy their necessaries. In this message there were Royal gifts on both sides, and rejoicings by the King of Porto Novo, who wants to be freed from the Egbas, for all the neighbourhood is against the Egbas. Perhaps Mr. ""Native"" will point out to me who are the Egbas\' friends in this part of Africa but England; and they have well paid them (five days from date will make ten years since). On the return of the Ibadans, the Egbas sent a chief warrior, called Ogundeyi, to plunder them, but Ogundeyi being a coward, as all the Egba war-chiefs are, hid himself in the bush till the Ibadans went away, and then told the Egbas that he did not find them. Of course they all knew it well, but dare not say it, as none are able to do more. So the Egbas blockaded their roads against Ogundeyi\'s wish, and sent to the King of Ijebu (with flattering words, such as ""you are our father,"" of our all and all"") to do the like as they have done in 1872 against Lagos. All the Ibadans then could not help but to show the Egbas that they are men, and even not so coward as the Egbas, declared war against them, not against the Ijebus, until the Ijebus provoke them;', 'last_edit_date': '1877-10-08', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1877#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Banquet to Governor Carter at Liverpool', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir Gilbert T. Carter, K.C.M.G., in responding, said that on his arrival in Lagos he was called upon to deal with an interior complication in connexion with the Jebus. The Jebus had acted as middlemen to the Yorubas, and barred them from access to Lagos, and hampering trade by tolls against the Yorubas bringing down their produce. This system had been the great bugbear of Lagos, and the attention of every administrator had been directed towards some means of abolishing it. The Jebus were a most intractable race, who would not alter their methods of government or system of trade. He found on arrival at Lagos, that this people had offered a gross insult to the acting governor while on a visit to Jebu Ode, endeavouring to settle a dispute, and to make some settlement in regard to freeing the roads from the interior to the Jebu country. Her Majesty’s Government, therefore, decided to insist upon an apology from the Jebus, and also upon a permanent settlement of the road question. A treaty was made but was kept but a very short time, and when an officer was sent to ask for an explanation his life was threatened; under such circumstances he felt further forbearance should not be exercised, and had no hesitation in recommending that they should be compelled to fulfil their treaty obligations. The result was the Jebu expedition, which had done more for the Colony of Lagos than any event since the cession to the British crown. The Egbas had closed their roads in sympathy with their neighbours; but the friendly intercourse was shortly resumed. The main incidents of the last expedition were known, so there was no necessity to dilate upon them. A treaty was concluded with the Egbas and the long-standing war between the Ibadans and the Ilorins was brought to a close. Apart from these points, a mass of information had been acquired in regard to interior affairs which could scarcely have been obtained in any other fashion. The recent events in Lagos had brought to the front the question of railways, and he had not been unmindful of this important factor in the development of new countries. Hitherto he had not been sanguine as to the prospect of West African railways, but his acquaintance with the Yoruba country had entirely changed his opinion. It has long been considered in Lagos that a railway in Abeokuta would offer the best chances of financial success, as it would traverse a fertile country, and its terminus would be close to Lagos. There was one important point in discussing the question of an interior railway. At present the Egbas withheld their consent to such a project, though he did not despair of removing their objection. In such matters progress must be slow, and it must not be forgotten that until his own visit no governor of Lagos had ever been permitted to enter Abeokuta. He did not anticipate any serious difficulty with the Yorubas, but they had not formally consented to the project. In the event of the construction of a railway to Ibadan, it would soon be necessary to extend it to the eastward, possibly as far as Ikirun.', 'last_edit_date': '1893-06-16', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_07_1893#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Leader', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'WE ARE MOST PLEASED to be able to record that the difficulties between the British Government and the Egbas, which, during the past year or so have been the fruitful source of all manner of trouble to the commercial prosperity of Lagos, seem at last to have received a satisfactory solution.

On the 10th there was a grand assembly of chiefs and people to welcome the Governor of Lagos.

We thank you for your truthfulness and justice, and manifest our joy and appreciation by having this large assembly to greet you. Welcome to Abeokuta!""

At last the efforts made have been crowned with success. The contending factions were grouped into two opposing sides. On the one side were the Ibadans, a powerful tribe situated right in the centre of the region of the war, and, therefore, surrounded by enemies; and on the other was a confederation of tribes under the general name of the Ekitiparapos. Man-catching was the real object of the war, and herein lay the great difficulty in the way of mediation; for it was obvious that none of the man-catching tribes would surrender their main source of revenue without a struggle. However, with the aid of two educated natives, a treaty of peace was signed in July, 1886, and ratified in the following September.\n\nThe first circumstance which opened up a prospect of successful mediation was an intimation received by Administrator Moloney, at Lagos, of a quarrel between the King of the Sebus and his people, the former wanting to continue the war and the latter to end it. It was not till long afterwards that Sir Samuel Rowe felt he was justified in interfering. His first attempt was not encouraging, but ultimately the Kings of the Ekitiparapos confederacy, twenty-six in number, appealed to the Governor, stating their grievances against the Ibadans, and asking him to prevent their being supplied with ammunition from Lagos through the agency of an Ibadan there.\n\nThe answer came from Mr. Moloney, who had assumed the government of the colony, and he addressed it to all the belligerents, rating them soundly for continuing the war, and offering his services as mediator. The replies were favourable. An armistice was arranged, and conferences were held. Statements setting forth the case for each tribe separately were forwarded to the Governor. In one of them (from the commander of the Jebus) the following passage occurs: ""Ile Ife is regarded by all our nation as the sacred spot from which we originated, and the Oni is respected as the father of all the Kings. This is why the Jebu King felt it his duty to reinstate the Ifes in the town. It was from Ile Ife that his father went to settle in the Jebu country.

All, however, that the Consul could wring out of the authorities on this point was a verbal promise that henceforth due intimation shall be given to the whole town, by the ringing of the big Egbo bell to give warning that the runners will be out; and, further, that the runners themselves shall always give notice of their approach by sounding the bell attached to their persons. This is a step in the right direction, but it does not strike at the root of the evil.

The textbook describes how Emperor Tewodros II of Ethiopia detained British consul Hormuzd Rassam and other foreigners to compel the British government to respond to his requests for foreign workers and military equipment. Initially, this strategy seemed effective, as the British government agreed to Tewodros's demands. However, relations deteriorated when Tewodros re-imprisoned the captives, partly due to reports of British activities perceived as threats to Ethiopian sovereignty. This incident illustrates the intricate diplomatic maneuvers and the leverage Tewodros attempted to exert over European powers, reflecting the broader context of European imperial interests in Africa. Similarly, The African Times articles highlight the detention of European captives, including Consul Cameron and missionaries, by the King of Abyssinia, and the diplomatic efforts made by the British government to secure their release. The involvement of Mr. Rassam, who was sent as an envoy to negotiate with the Emperor, and the subsequent release of the captives after diplomatic exchanges, underscore the complex diplomatic maneuvers involved. The articles also mention the influence of European powers, such as the British government's instructions and the involvement of the Foreign Office, which reflect the power dynamics at play. Additionally, the articles highlight the challenges faced in communication and negotiation, such as the King's initial refusal to release the captives and the need for assurances of goodwill before their departure.

The Emperor's long-forgotten letter was taken from the files, and a reply was quickly drawn up and entrusted to Hormuzd Rassam, the British Assistant Resident in Aden. After much delay Rassam reached the Emperor's camp in February 1866. TØwodros's position had by then seriously deteriorated. T. M.

The port became the property of a private Italian shipping company, the Societa Rubattino, and in 1882 was declared an Italian colony. 37 Emperor Yohannes, though a notable patriot and a staunch adherent of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, was less immediately concerned with the advent of Italy than with the departure of Egypt.$^{38}$ The latter then ruled much of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden coasts of Africa, and their immediate hinterlands, including the port of Massa wa and the city of Harar. Egypt, which had come under British occupation in 1882, was faced with the rebellion of the Sudanese Mahdï, Muhammad Ahmad, which caused Britain to decide in 1883 that the Sudan would have to be evacuated of Egyptian and British troops. Egyptian rule thereupon collapsed in the whole Red Sea and Gulf of Aden area bordering Ethiopia. Since several Sudanese towns with Egyptian garrisons and European inhabitants were besieged by the Mahdists, Britain decided on enlisting Yohannes's help in their evacuation. A British officer, Rear-Admiral Sir William Hewett, was dispatched to negotiate with Yohannes who agreed to assist, but he also stipulated that territories on the Sudanese frontier recently occupied by Egypt should be returned to him. He also asked for control of Massawa. His first demand was accepted, but, as for the port, Britain merely promised free transit 'under British protection' for Ethiopian goods, including arms and ammunition.$^{39}$ A treaty embodying these principles was signed on 3 June 1884, after which the notable Ethiopian warrior Ras Alula relieved six garrisons in the Sudan. 40 The value of the agreement was, however, short-lived, for on 3 February 1885, the Italians seized Massawa.

Euro-African contacts, which until the beginning of our period had been confined largely to the coastal peripheries, were, in the period under review, steadily extended inland as a result of the Industrial Revolution, largely through the efforts first of explorers, then traders and, finally, missionaries. This steady extension of European contacts and influence inland included not only guns and powder, but also railways, telegraphs, agricultural and mining machinery, the print› ing press, technical education and, above all, finance capital. These new developments created opportunities, but also challenges and dangers. Among the most novel and interesting features of African history during the period were the initiatives and reactions of African rulers and advisers in the face of these opportunities and challenges. It would appear that in most cases the approach of the Africans was not simply one of blind imitation or wholesale substitution but rather one of adaptation and syn› thesis. Instances of this process of modernization in Africa are legion. 56 Egypt built its first printing press at Büläk, Cairo, in 1822; the first printing press was established in Portuguese Luanda in 1841; the first modern mines were opened in Algeria in 1845 and in the Gold Coast in the 1870s. Some of the states, such as Ethiopia and Tunisia, embarked on public works; nearly all the Barbary states, as well as Egypt reformed their monetary systems. Other states, such as Egypt, set up textile and cotton mills, saw mills, glassworks and paper mills, all during the reign of Muhammad 'AIL But more interesting and of far-reaching consequence was the moder› nization process in the military sphere. In the face of steady European encroachment, many African states, especially in North and West Africa, modernized the organization, training, equipment and recruitment of their armies. As will be seen in later chapters, Morocco, for instance, set up at Fez an engineering school to train artillery men, surveyors, and car› tographers and sent soldiers abroad for training.

The French and British dispatched diplomatic missions to sign treaties with him, while other embassies arrived from the Sudanese Mahdists, the Sultan of the Ottoman empire and the Tsar of Russia. 59 The outcome of the battle, the greatest victory of an African over a European army since the time of Hannibal, was of major significance in the history of Europe's relations with Africa. The Ethiopians acquired prestige throughout the Red Sea area, as noted by the Polish traveller, Count Potocki, who remarked that the Somali displayed 'race-pride on the victory of their neighbours over a great European power'. 60 Increasing interest in Ethiopia, the last indigenous independent state in black Africa, was also evinced by black intellectuals in the New World. The Haitian, Benito Sylvain, one of the first apostles of pan-Africanism, travelled to Ethiopia four times between 1889 and 1906, carrying letters to and from President Alexis of Haiti,$^{61}$ while William H. Ellis, a black American of Cuban descent, visited the country twice in 1903 and 1904 with various plans for economic development and the settlement of black Americans. 62 An Ethiopian impact was also felt in South Africa where the biblical prophecy about Ethiopia stretching forth her hands unto God had aroused interest some years earlier. An Ethiopian Church had been established in South Africa by 1900.$^{63}$ Increasing awareness of Ethiopia was later mani› fested by the appearance in 1911 of the Gold Coast intellectual J. E.

These treaties took two forms - those between Africans and Europeans, and bilateral agreements between the Europeans themselves. The African-European treaties were basically of two kinds. Firstly, there were the slave trade and the commercial treaties; these had generated friction, which in turn led to European political interference in African affairs. Secondly, there were the political treaties by which African rulers either purportedly surrendered sovereignty in return for protection, or undertook not to enter into treaty obligations with other European nations.\nThese political treaties were in vogue during our period. They were made either by representatives of European governments or by those of private organizations who later transferred them to their respective govern› ments. If a metropolitan government accepted them, the territories in question were usually annexed or declared a protectorate; if, on the other hand, it suspected their authenticity, or if it felt constrained by the vicissi› tudes of Weltpolitik to exercise caution, these treaties were used for bargaining purposes during the bilateral European negotiations. Africans, on the other hand, entered into these arrangements for a variety of motives, but particularly because of the interests of their people. In some cases, they desired treaty relations with Europeans because they hoped that the prestige of such a relationship would endow them with certain political advantages in dealing with their neighbours. Sometimes a weak African state would desire a treaty with a European power in the hope of using it to renounce allegiance to another African state that claimed sovereignty over it. An African sovereign would also desire a treaty in the hope of using it to keep recalcitrant subject states in line. And sometimes a treaty with one European nation was seen by some African states as a means of preserving their independence which was being threatened by other European nations.$^{42}$ Whatever was the case, the African-European political treaties played an important role in the final partition of Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""However, as Professor Adu Boahen has correctly pointed out, it is a distortion of African history to see it in terms of heroes and villains. This approach fails to consider the prevailing circumstances under which various groups or individuals operated. The options available to them and their interpretations of these options may have been different from those imposed on them by politicians and scholars alike. It makes sense, as Boahen has suggested, to see the events of the time and their key actors in terms of diplomacy, pursued independently or backed by force. To appreciate the extent to which diplomacy could go, it is necessary to understand the socio-economic forces operating in a particular society at the time of the encounter. For East Africa, a survey of such factors in the 1890s will be an appropriate setting for the events that followed. But, as R. I. Rotberg and Ali Mazrui state: 'There is no gainsaying that the introduction of Western norms and power and accompanying controls was everywhere in Africa questioned by the people affected'. 2 This questioning, however, took various forms. 'The response to the in› vasion was determined by the structure of each society at the time. Though all societies were determined to preserve their sovereignty, the reaction to invasion was not uniform.'$^{3}$ Variations occurred in accordance with the social cohesion or otherwise of a given society.\nIn the 1890s - the period that preceded European occupation of East Africa - the societies of the region had achieved differing stages of social organization.$^{4}$ Some, such as the Baganda and the Banyoro in Uganda, the Banyambo in Tanganyika (now Tanzania) and the Wanga in Kenya, had achieved a high degree of centralized government (see Fig. 7.1). In such societies, response to foreign penetration tended to be dictated by the king or the leadership as a whole. What had existed in Europe at one time - 'The religion of the king is my religion' - sums up the attitude well. Other societies, such as the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika or the Nandi in Kenya were in the process of forming centralized governments. This process is often referred to as state formation. However, the vast majority of societies in this region did not have centralized governments. But lack of central governments does not imply lack of government, a mistake which some foreigners commenting on African societies have made in the past."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""based on contributions from A.

Partly in response to the French forward policy, the British showed no less eagerness to consolidate and defend their positions. The discovery of diamonds in 1869-70 in Griqualand West in South Africa, and the prospects of finding gold in large quantities, began to raise the fever of competition and alter the basis of the relationship between Europeans in Africa and between them and the Africans. Various European activities, hitherto pursued seemingly for their own sake or for humanitarian purposes, began to be re-evaluated from the point of view of their contribution to various European national interests. Explorers were no longer expected merely to satisfy scientific curiosity but were also encouraged to gather strategic intelligence and trade secrets. Missionaries were not just individual servants of God obeying a divine call to evangelize but were regarded as organized national agents of acculturation, part of whose objective was to weaken the cultural and commercial exclusivity of their hosts. Traders were not just seeking profit, but were preparing the way for their own nations to establish control. Thus the widespread collaboration between Africans and Europeans, seemingly to utilize Euro› pean ideas and European technologies for nation-building in the rev› olutionary situation of the nineteenth century began to be seen as subversive, contributing directly to the systematic abortion of the efforts of African leaders to reform and modernize their societies.\nIn the same vein, African rulers generally viewed the activities of abolitionists as negative. In many cases, with the ending of the Atlantic slave trade, and after resisting and stalling, they began to co-operate to the extent that alternative trade in agricultural produce, gold, ivory and other commodities came to replace the slave trade and there was no interference with the holding of slaves and other sources of enforced labour. There was thus a basis for co-operation. As noted above, increased use of slaves was the basis of that co-operation. The Europeans recognized this, but in the 1870s, while not abandoning that position, began to use emancipation as a potential factor for weakening the economic base of African states. It should be specifically noted in this connection that most of the armies the Europeans were raising were manned by emancipated African slaves loyal to their redeemers, who armed and commanded them.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The legacy of wars', 'content': 'In other words, while European powers were dealing with individual African states, recognizing them, befriending some and fighting others in Africa, in Europe they closed ranks along racial lines and formed a cartel to regulate the flow of essential arms to the Africans. African leaders had no answer to this strategy. The competition for power in Africa had been drawn into the international politics of the Concert of Europe where African diplomatic skills were at a grave disadvantage. It is doubtful whether African leaders realized until too late how great was the danger that threatened them. They were used to thinking that the European base was far away and that, in the final analysis, they had the advantage of numbers.\nThey continued to act as if they could play off one European power against another. In South Africa, they even believed that they could appeal to the Queen of England and her direct representatives to carry out treaty obligations against the wishes of Anglo-Boer settlers and fortune seekers. Far from any notion of forging a pan-African solidarity similar to that pursued by the Europeans, each African state acted as seemed best in its own individual interest.\nIt appears that, if any factor is to be singled out, the basic explanation for this was to be found not only in the diplomatic abilities of the European strategists, but also in the legacy of wars that was part of the revolutionary situation of nineteenth-century Africa. It was the intensity of the rivalries and the bitterness of the wars that made African rulers slow to realize that tackling the European threat should have taken precedence over their inter› state rivalries, and that they should have united to face it.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Increased European pressures', 'content': ""As we have already mentioned, during the period under discussion East Africa was part of a large informal empire under British control. Towards the end of this period, however, the rise of Germany as a major Western power was beginning to increase the competition that already existed. Outside the East African sphere, tensions caused by this competition were already beginning to appear. When King Leopold called an international conference in Brussels in 1876 'to discuss methods of peaceful and co- operative action to develop legitimate commerce and attack the slave trade',$^{62}$ the rivalry was already appearing on the surface. The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo. The most significant action of the period was the British occupation of Egypt in 1882. For the British the action was justified because of the strategic position of Egypt (with the Suez Canal and the Nile) for British interests in India and East Africa, although East Africa was considered of less importance. But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year. In West Africa Germany and France were beginning to stand together to challenge the British position on the Niger. The 'high tide of imperialism' had begun to flow. When Bismark convened the Berlin Conference in November 1884, the process of partitioning Africa had already started. In East Africa Carl Peters had already arrived in Zanzibar under the auspices of his Gesellschaft für Deutsche Kolonisation (German Colonization Society) and had gone inland to negotiate treaties.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains.

These facilitated, partly caused, and were also in part the result of the changes we have noted above in the political structures and military systems. More than that, there was a growing demand for labour outside the customary bounds of the household unit, the village community or age grade associations. While the various societies remained resistant to freemen selling their labour, the predominant tendency in the nineteenth century was towards expansion of the scale of slave labour, an increase in the areas in which enforced labour was used, and a greater use of migrant labour. The general trend in the third quarter of the nineteenth century was for increased slaveholding in general, even in rural areas, an increase in the number of slaves held within each household, and an increase in the use of slaves in production under quasi-capitalist conditions, thus making their lives harsher than ever before. 18 With the intensification of political rivalries from the very beginning of the century, it became usual to press disputes over land, cattle, and even doctrinal differences to the point of completely destroying the enemy as an identifiable entity. Whole communities were incorporated into existing polities or dispersed and the bulk of the young men and women taken away as captives. Such captives were used to satisfy the increasing demand for labour in agriculture, craft production and mining and also as warriors in the emerging professional armies. The new state structures and military systems diminished the importance of the old aristocracies, whose members had depended on the accumulation of wives and extended families for their social, economic and political support, but they also created new bureaucratic groups that needed to be freed from normal agricultural duties. These new aristocracies depended not on large kinship groups as such, but on large households of clients and captives who maintained increasingly large farms to provision the household as well as groups of warriors at the battlefront.

The British and French foreign ministers, Hoare and Laval, therefore met in Paris on 7 December to devise a new compromise. It had two main principles: first, an 'exchange of territories' whereby Ethiopia would cede to Italy the Ogaden and a large part of Tigre in exchange for a port on either the Red Sea or the Gulf of Aden; second, Italy would be given a 'zone of economic expansion and colonization' in the greater part of Ethiopia south of Addis Ababa; this area was to remain part of Ethiopia, but Italy was to have exclusive economic rights therein. News of this plan, which was a criminal surrender to the condemned aggressor and a total abandonment of the League, leaked to the French press, and created a storm of indignation in many countries, particularly in Britain where Hoare was obliged to resign on 18 December. 118 Ethiopia at the close of 1935 was thus in the forefront of world news and the centre of international excitement and indignation. ' '$^{9}$ A British Foreign Secretary had fallen for what was considered as Britain's betrayal, while in Ethiopia's rugged mountains a powerful Fascist army using the most modern weapons of war, including poison gas, was temporarily halted by the heroism of Ethiopia's relatively poorly-armed warriors.$^{120}$ It was a case of David and Goliath re-enacted in the greatest colonial war ever fought on the continent of Africa. Though the Ethiopian army was soon to be defeated, much fierce fighting lay ahead before the Italians occupied Addis Ababa on 6 May 1936. This was followed by five long years of Italian Fascist usurpation, during four of which the Ethiopian patriots were to fight on alone. 121 The Duce's invasion evoked instant reaction in and around Africa. 122 In August 1935, a group of Africans and persons of African descent in London founded the International African Friends of Abyssinia, whose committee included C. L. R. James of the West Indies, Dr P. McD. Millard of British Guiana, Marcus Garvey's wife Amy Ashwood Garvey, Mohammed Said of Somaliland, and Dr J. B. Danquah of the Gold Coast.

It is more likely that, as in the djikàd states, the seeds of collapse came from internal discontent and yearning for reform, and the actual collapse owed more to the penetration of Islamic ideas and the direct impact of the Sokoto djihad than to the slave trade and/or abolition. The consequent wars, population movements, colonization of new areas hitherto regarded as marginal such as the coastal swamps, the rise of new towns and markets, and the spirit of reform and experimentation, created new opportunities that the Europeans came to exploit rather than to set in motion.\nThis groping for renewal, then, will explain why so many African rulers in the course of the nineteenth century from Egypt and Tunisia to Madagascar and Lesotho, Abeokuta and Fanteland, suspicious as they were of European intentions, nevertheless risked cautious collaboration with European traders, adventurers or missionaries as a way of importing European technology to assist their work of development. It was not only Egypt that experienced a sense of renaissance.

The slaves exported from Ethiopia in the nineteenth century to various parts of Asia were mostly children, ranging in age from 8 to 16 years. Some were captives taken in the wars waged by the southern Ethiopian kingdom of Shoa on the Oromo ('Galla') peoples along its borders. The slaves were carried in caravans of several hundreds and transported to the Ethiopian coast for shipment at the ports of Berbera, Zeila, Tajura, Assab, Obock and Massawa, from where they were ferried across the Red Sea to the ports of Jeddah, Mocha, and Hoideida. Buyers came from several towns in the Yemen and the Hidjâz. There were also seaborne traders from the Hadramawt, Zanzibar, Oman, India and the Persian Gulf. This trade was largely in Arab hands backed by Indian financiers from the Gujarat (Banians). 6\nThe major source of supply of slaves to Asia was, however, eastern Africa. As pointed out by J. B. Kelly,$^{7}$ the slave trade from Zanzibar was virtually a monopoly of the Muscat Arabs and their rulers who derived their revenue mostly from the custom duties levied on the trade. In the early nineteenth century, Muscat was the greatest clearing house of the traffic to the Gulf, Persia, Irak and India, but as the century wore on its dominance was to be challenged by the port of Sur to the southward. The majority of the slaves landed at Muscat were sold within Oman itself. The rest were bought by agents from the Trucial Coast, notably the Kawâsim, for resale on the coast or in the markets of Persia, Irak, Bahrain, Kuwait, Hasa and Nadj. From Muscat and Sur, slaves were also conveyed to the ports of SindhTKutch, Kathiawar and the Bombay Presidency, in Bahraini, Kuwaiti and Indian bottoms. Those intended for the Persian market were landed at Bushire as well as brought across the Gulf to Lingah from Sharjah. It is important to note that, in the early nineteenth century, slaves were rarely brought all the way across Arabia from the Red Sea for sale on the Gulf Coast.

European abolitionists found, for example, that to stop the slave trade and the wars in the interior, they had to reckon not just with the coastal rulers but also with the different power bases in the interior. Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome. Similarly, British peace› makers involved in resolving aspects of nineteenth-century Yoruba warfare had to travel virtually throughout the length and breadth of the culture area.\nUnfortunately, the European approach was divisive, tending towards politically structured differentiation. This was already noticeable in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era. British interests came to be specifically protected visà-vis the interest of other European nationals; British interests were also advanced against those of Africans.

A regularly constituted Embassy from England could not have been treated with greater honour and attention. A few hours after his first interview with his Majesty, the latter ordered the release of all the European prisoners, including the missionaries and the Frenchmen, and directed that they should all be made over to Mr. Rassam, to take out with him from Abyssinia, which he hoped to leave about the end of March. The King sent his chamberlain to Magdala to unfetter the prisoners, and to bring them to meet Mr. Rassam at Debra Tabor, to which place the latter and his companions were proceeding from the Court, then in Godjam, and where he expected to receive the released captives about the end of February. The Emperor has written a most polite letter to the Queen, which Mr. Rassam felt sure would please Her Majesty and the British nation. The Emperor had also made Mr. Rassam handsome presents, and was preparing more to give to the mission before leaving the country. The above was received at Massowah on the 18th of March. We may, therefore, expect to hear of Mr. Rassam having actually met and received the released captives about the 10th or 12th proximo, when the Victoria will again visit Massowah.—I have the honour to be, my lord, your lordship\'s most obedient servant,\n\n""W.

He then adds: ""A rebellion, headed by a chief named Tissoo Gabazai, had broken out in different parts of the country, and it is not improbable that this circumstance may have rendered the roads unsafe towards the coast.

Hence it is very difficult to obtain any reliable information respecting the state of things at Gondar, and every attempt to communicate privately with Captain Cameron and the other British captives has proved unsuccessful. It appears that our unfortunate countrymen are confined in a tent next to that of the King, and all intercourse with them is strictly forbidden under the severest penalties.

The captives, Messrs. Stern, Rosenthal, and the English Consul, have not only not been set at liberty, but have suffered from great violence. According to information, received from different authorities, the prisoners find themselves placed in the most pitiful condition, as the rainy season has gravely affected their health. The ostensible cause of ill-treatment on the part of the King seems to lie in the discovery which his Majesty made in the journal of Messrs. Stern and Rosenthal as to his maternal descent. Mr. Stern mentions in his confiscated paper that the King\'s mother had been a vendor of kosso, a medicinal fruit that is constantly used by the Abyssinians. Mr. Stern was quite right in his assertion, for it is true that the King\'s mother was a seller of kosso, whereas his father was a relation of Dedjaji Comfoo, the governor of Dembea, who beat back several times the Egyptian troops that came from Senaar. In the beginning of his reign the King (who was then a kind and liberal man, and not a despot, as he has become since the death of Mr. Bell, his adjutant, who kept him in a moral check) often used to say, ""If I do not help the poor people they will complain of me before God, for I myself have been a poor man."" Had Theodoros been a man of Napoleon\'s stamp, he would not have felt ashamed of his descent, nor would he have had recourse to the absurd idea of being descended from King Solomon, who had a son, as the Abyssinians say, called Menelik, who was sent to Ethiopia, which was then subjected to the Queen of Sheba. Hence the Royal Family of Abyssinia consider themselves to this day the lineal descendants of Solomon, an idea to which King Theodoros attaches the greatest importance, and which he is said to have strongly stated in his late correspondence with Napoleon to outdo the latter in respect of genealogy. Theodoros, very angry at Mr. Stern\'s assertion, wished to know the source from which he had derived his information. As he would not mention the name of his informant, the King ordered him and Mr. Rosenthal to be beaten and put to the Abyssinian rack—i.e., the wrist of the hand and upper part of the arm of both gentlemen were firmly tied with ropes, in consequence of which the blood was forced out of the tips of the fingers After the prisoners had confessed the rack was removed, but one may imagine how dreadfully they suffered.

1602,Colonel Ord's brief visit to Lagos resulted in widespread distrust and diplomatic isolation due to his insufficient understanding of local complexities and the perception of British officials as instigators of conflict.,"The examination of both the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles reveals a nuanced perspective on the claim regarding Colonel Ord's brief visit to Lagos. The textbook does not specifically mention Colonel Ord or his visit, nor does it directly address any resulting distrust or diplomatic isolation due to his actions. However, it discusses broader themes of British colonial interference, such as ""divide and conquer"" tactics, treaty impositions, and exploitation of local rivalries, which align with the claim's suggestion of British officials being perceived as instigators of conflict. It also highlights the complexities of local politics and the challenges faced by colonial administrators in understanding these dynamics, indirectly supporting the notion of insufficient understanding by British officials. On the other hand, The African Times articles do not provide direct evidence linking Colonel Ord's visit to widespread distrust or diplomatic isolation. Instead, they focus on the actions of other British officials, like Captain Glover, and their impact on Lagos, including issues like arms export prohibition and merchant dissatisfaction. While the articles mention Colonel Ord's limited understanding of the intricate relations between Lagos and neighboring regions, they do not explicitly connect this to widespread distrust or isolation, attributing these issues more to other officials and broader British policies. Thus, both sources highlight the complexities of British colonial interactions in the region but lack specific evidence directly tying Colonel Ord's visit to the claimed outcomes.","The provided paragraphs from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook do not specifically mention Colonel Ord or his visit to Lagos, nor do they directly address any resulting distrust or diplomatic isolation due to his actions.

The few exceptions included, notably, General (later Marshal) Lyautey in Morocco, Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard in Northern Nigeria and Sir Gordon Guggisberg in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators. There is among the whole of this badly payed and very wretched elite - as remote from indigenous society, from which it has been driven out, as it is from European society into which it is not admitted - a feeling of disillusionment, discontent and bitterness which it would prove dangerous to be unaware of. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': ""Because the lands and peoples were so interwoven, developments in one part always had effects and implications in other parts.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century.

This involvement of both Britain and France in the trade and politics of Lagos and Porto Novo respectively sparked off a spell of dramatic rivalry between the two powers in a bid to control Yorubaland, especially the western parts, and the adjacent Aja-speaking communities.

Such, indeed, was the conflict between the leaders of the NCBWA and those of the Aborigines Rights' Protection Society, and between the leaders of both on the one hand and the traditional rulers led by Nana Sir Ofori Atta in the Gold Coast on the other. These conflicts greatly weakened the nationalist movement in that country. Similarly, it was largely because of the internal dissensions and personality conflicts in the Lagos branch of the NCBWA and the opposition of Sir Kitoyi Ajasa's Nigerian Pioneer and the Lagos conservatives that the fourth session of the NCBWA could not take place in Lagos until 1930. Fourthly, it would appear that the limited elective representation granted between 1923 and 1925 had the effect of politically anaesthetizing the nationalist movements. Finally, and undoubtedly, the death of Casely Hayford in 1930 constituted the final coup de grâce for nationalist activities in British West Africa in general and in the Gold Coast in particular in the inter-war years.\nFor all these reasons, then, by the end of the period under review, politics and nationalism in British West Africa were at their lowest ebb, and it needed two events to ginger them up again, the Ethiopian crisis of 1935 and the Second World War of 1939-45, discussion of both of which belongs to the last volume of this work."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.608, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British, Boers and Africans in South Africa, 1850-80', 'section_title': 'British withdrawal from the interior', 'content': ""Warden, the British Resident, could not bring about peace in the area either.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858.

Even with more reinforcements he received from the British government in March 1852, Smith failed to crush the Xhosa rising. The war was only brought to an end by his successor, Sir George Cathcart, who enlisted the support of the Cape white farmers by promising to give them a part of the cattle looted during the campaign.\nIndeed when the Xhosa were defeated in October 1852, both the Xhosa of Sandile and those of Sarili - who lived east of the Kei and had mostly accorded moral support to their fighting western brethren - lost vast herds of cattle to the British. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.607, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'Politics and nationalism in British West Africa > Inter-territorial movements and international movements: the National Congress of British West Africa', 'content': ""They condemned the right assumed by the European powers of exchanging or partitioning countries between them without reference to, or regard for, the wishes of the people, which they declared to be tanta› mount to a species of slavery.

The tensions reached such a pitch that Boshof was forced into a tactical resignation in February 1858 and, when he withdrew his resignation, several members of the volksraad left in protest. Coupled with the internal disputes were the increasing border quarrels with Lesotho. Boshof decided to check the border disputes by invading Lesotho in March 1858.

He sends private messages to Dahomey to attack Abeokuta the coming dry season, and to the Ibadans to attack the Jebu Ode, and he will help them from here; he secretly, with the Yorubas here, sending powder and guns to the Ibadans, and he himself going about the rivers and creeks with the steamer Eyo to cause commotion; so that the Ibadans may be induced to commence operations, because the Administrator cannot go to war in territories not our own without the sanction of the Administrator-in-Chief.

But the very fact of such an insinuation or charge against the Administrator of Lagos finding any credence whatever among educated men in that colony, is of itself sufficient to prove how greatly men\'s minds have been unsettled by late proceedings on the part of the Administrator.\n\nCapital is timid and suspicious. A trade amounting, as that of Lagos now does, to some five hundred thousand pounds sterling a-year easily takes alarm; and when alarmed by acts and views attributed, whether justly or erroneously, to a local executive government, over whose acts the persons engaged in so large a commerce do not possess any control whatever, I do not think that it is in any way derogatory to the dignity of those who can alone control the acts and views of that local executive, that they should condescend to allay apprehensions which may produce largely disastrous results if permitted long to prevail.\n\nI should not have intruded on your lordship with so long a letter had the reply to my former one contained even a single word that might reassure the merchants and traders of Lagos, and those in this country who are involved in pecuniary relations with them; and entreating your lordship\'s patient consideration and enlightened action in this important matter, I have the honour to remain, my Lord, yours most respectfully,\n\nF.

Captain Glover has been fooling the Colonial-office, in Downing-street, with all sorts of reports, to make sure of his promotion, as he said and believes the more people talk against him the better he will be esteemed by the Secretary of State and other superior authorities. Captain Glover is so mean in his dealings with the lowest class of natives as to make them believe that he has only to deal with the Queen, and that no other power can question what he is doing. He sets nation against nation, country against country—divides friends against one another, and, to crown all, he holds the destiny of Lagos and the interior in his hands. Acting on the powers reserved to him in the prohibition of export of arms and ordnance, he sent lots of ammunition to all the ex-chiefs and princes of Porto Novo, to fight against their lawful King, and to cause civil war there; he dealt out guns, powder, shot, swords, knives, and other implements of war, to all the surrounding tribes, Western and Northern, to fight against the Egbas; and the natives in the Eastern part to fight against the Jebus at Ikno-du; and last, not least, he shipped ammunition by night to the Ibadan by a round-about route. We say, Mr. Editor, all this is done at the expense of the settlement, contrary to the true interests of the settlement; and can it be strange that we are all in danger of being ruined? The consequence is that all the surrounding countries refuse to treat with him, because of his deceitful and treacherous acts; and the Egbas have closed their road for as long as Glover is in Lagos. Captain Glover now said he had opened a new road in the Eastern district to go to Ibadan. He invited the merchants; we went, and saw nothing. We reported this to him; he got annoyed, and determined to open a bush road, by force of arms, to get fame! He is trying to be Governor-in-Chief. He wants to be knighted, and to be Sir John Glover. Alas! false reports to the Colonial-office will no doubt get this for him. We believe in it. Again, when the Government seized some cases of gin from the French vessel Co-operation in 1867, the Secretary of State ordered the seizure money to be returned to Regis Ainè, at Lagos. The amounts were paid thus: the Collector refunded his share, and the Treasury refunded that of the Colony; Captain Glover, as Administrator, never refunded his share of 340l.; he made the Colony pay it; and in the name of honesty we solemnly protest against this. Captain Glover has not paid or refunded that 340l. from 1867 to this month of April, 1872. Alas! Captain Glover, if no human being is capable of checking you, have you forgotten that the Creator sees you, and you shall have to give an account? We tax-payers cannot afford to allow the Colony to pay this 340l. for you, and the Secretary of State ought to order you to pay it immediately. We say, moreover, that you ought to refund all the expenses you incur in supplying unnecessary ammunitions, &c., to the natives to excite them to rebel against their countrymen and sovereign. We tell you in plain terms your policy tends to our ruin. You may fool the authorities, and know how to play the game to get promotion, as you say, but we say it is not right. It is said that when any public officers are abused, then the Colonial-office is sure to promote them; and so you are certain you will be promoted. We should not care about this, but we object to be made to pay the piper.

By sundry unnecessary and threatening voyages in the colonial steamer, attended by a force of Houssas, &c., he has given colour to the belief that he has such plans in contemplation; and considering what took place in the years 1864-1867, it is not surprising that merchants and traders, the whole of whose property would be imperilled and destroyed by a renewal of the overt and secret acts of policy then committed, should even give credit to the report of their Administrator having allowed his feelings of hostility against the Egba nations so far to prevail with him over all just, honourable, humane, and politic considerations, as to induce him privately to instigate the Kings of Dahomey and Ibadan conjointly to attack, and if possible destroy Abeokuta during the present dry season.\n\nThe proper policy of Lagos, as a great emporium of trade for extensive inland countries, must manifestly be to cultivate amicable relations with all of them, and scrupulously to abstain from everything that could give rise to suspicions of hostile feelings or intentions as regards any of them.

Acting under cover of authority, respectable natives have been arrested on pain of being locked up in the guard-room of the Houssas, or seized and deported to St. Helena, without any real cause, while the accused is kept ignorant of his offence. Such, Sir, are the acts of certain officials (European and native) in Lagos, who design to gain popularity, honour, and promotion by misrepresentations. The administrations of Sir Samuel Rowe, Lieut.-Governor Griffith, Captain Moloney, and Captain Rumsey are disparaged by these men. We ask, can a servant be greater than his master? These men say they know Lagos and Africa more than any other person. But what knowledge can be looked for from men whose previous lives have been all unfitted for such duties as they now have to perform? It is honourable to rise from humble positions; yet the mind should be humble; and when uncultivated, to give such persons positions is dangerous. Is it customary for the Premier of England, or the Secretary of State for the Colonies, to send a policeman from their official residence in Downing-street to arrest any of the members of the Opposition simply on the report that they speak against the Government, and on their arrival in Downing-street to abuse and insult them, and ultimately send them to prison forthwith, or exile to Canada, saying that the official powers are extraordinary and unlimited? We ask, is this possible? and would such action show a cultivated mind and civility? It is an open secret in Lagos that such treatment is by no means uncommon here.\n\nIt is a blessing that we are under a Governor-in-Chief who is well able to check the ambitious views of his subordinates.\n\nIs it usual for the Premier of England or Governor of a colony to send a superintendent of police with one or two constables to proclaim, without law or ordinance, that no provisions are to be sold to a neighbouring friendly country; and if such country retaliate by stopping its own supply, then for the sovereign of the friendly country to be accused as a barbarous and atrocious king?—Your obedient servants,\n\n**LAGOSIANS.**', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-28', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lagos and its Affairs—Captain Strachan and Captain Glover', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We shall be sorry indeed to find that the Colonial-office has made another mistake in the appointment of Captain Strachan to the Administratorship of Lagos.

During the interview of the commercial deputation with Earl Kimberley in May last, his lordship spoke so confidently as to the merits of Captain Strachan, who might be regarded ""as almost a civilian,"" that we expected to hear of a courteous, confidence-inspiring Administrator installed in his person within the walls of the Government-house at Lagos. We regret, however, that it should be our duty to state that the first impressions at Lagos have not been favourable as regards the new Administrator. If the description came to us from one quarter only, we should have taken no public notice of it; but it comes to us from several and distinct ones; and what we gather is, that his tone is not at all a soothing one; his bearing is lofty, for Africa, and frightens even Europeans away from Government-house. We cannot help feeling that this is a bad beginning. His predecessor, Mr. Berkeley, the present Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast Settlements, gained golden opinions of all in Lagos; he was beloved there; and we never heard that the public service was thereby injured, or the Queen\'s government thereby lowered in the estimation of Europeans or natives. It would be, indeed, lamentable should Colonel Strachan undo what Mr. Berkeley effected; nor do we hesitate to say that such a result would put an end at once and for ever to the system of appointing naval and military men as Administrators of commercial settlements—a system which was, with so much reason, denounced by the deputation, to whose interview with Earl Kimberley we have before alluded.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-11-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_11_1873#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the present time, from all parts of the West African coast, we have reports of troubles and disturbances, which must hamper trade and retard the commercial and civilising development of that part of the Dark Continent.

They forget the fact that a wound which can be inflicted in a moment cannot be healed for a long time. I state it as an indisputable fact which can bear any test of investigation, that Captain Glover, during the period of his administration of the government of this settlement (from 1863 to 1872), managed to inflict such serious political wounds on the minds of the Egbas and Ijebus, that it is surprising he and his friends should expect those wounds to be healed in the very short time in which Governor Hennessy tried to heal them. Happily for Lagos Lord Kimberley sent out Governor Hennessy at the time he did; otherwise I cannot say how serious the state of things in Lagos would have become.

But in the interests of African civilization, of the African people, of legitimate commerce, and therefore of Lagos itself, this sort of indulgence cannot be indefinitely extended. We have given the local government carte blanche for a long period—perhaps for too long a one. The late ordinance issued there makes us feel very strongly that this is the case.

The importance of Abeokuta as regards the spread of civilization, if in constant friendly alliance with Lagos and in peaceful relations with its African neighbours, is indisputable; and we cannot approve (leaving the past, reopened by the letters we have inserted, for the present unjudged) of any measures that tend to prolong the epoch of alienation after the Abeokuta authorities have made—as it seems to us that they have made—every reasonable concession to Lagos demands.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

It was governed by its native king, who was placed on the throne, after the expulsion of the usurper, by the efforts of the British squadron, and was maintained in that position by the same power, and lastly it had the assistance, as British Consuls, of men of ability and local experience, who exerted themselves in every way to promote its prosperity and advancement.
