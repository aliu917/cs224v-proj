150,"During the 1850s, Liberia maintained a generally friendly and strategically significant diplomatic relationship with Great Britain, which played a crucial role in its early recognition and support as an independent republic.","The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles offer contrasting perspectives on the diplomatic relationship between Liberia and Great Britain during the 1850s. The General History of Africa highlights tensions and disputes, particularly concerning issues of sovereignty, trade, and territorial boundaries. It notes that the British challenged Liberia's sovereignty, prompting diplomatic interventions by the United States to clarify Liberia's status as an independent republic rather than an American colony. The textbook also describes British annexation of Liberian territories and the lack of British support when Liberia sought international assistance for boundary disputes, suggesting a contentious relationship during this period. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim of a generally friendly and strategically significant relationship, noting that Great Britain was the first power to recognize Liberia, sending a British man-of-war to Monrovia to salute the new flag. This act of recognition, along with President Roberts' successful European tour, including a commercial treaty with England and collaboration against the slave trade, underscores the strategic significance of the relationship. However, the articles do not specifically focus on the 1850s, instead providing a broader historical context of Liberia's diplomatic relations. Thus, while The African Times supports the claim of a friendly relationship, it lacks specificity regarding the 1850s, contrasting with the textbook's depiction of a contentious relationship during that decade.","The General History of Africa textbook does not provide any information that supports the claim that during the 1850s, Liberia maintained a generally friendly and strategically significant diplomatic relationship with Great Britain, which played a crucial role in its early recognition and support as an independent republic.

This act of recognition and support aligns with the claim of a friendly relationship. Additionally, President Roberts' successful tour through Europe, including England, where he concluded a commercial treaty and was accepted as an ally in the campaign against the slave trade, further underscores the strategic significance of the relationship.

However, the articles do not provide specific details about the 1850s, focusing instead on the broader historical context of Liberia's diplomatic relations. This lack of specificity regarding the 1850s is a notable difference from the claim, which emphasizes that particular decade.

Thereafter, up to about 1906, over 18000 New World Africans mostly aided by the ACS settled, annually, in Liberia in congeries of over thirty towns close to the Atlantic littoral on land obtained by the ACS or the Liberian government from the African chiefs of the region. Almost all of them were Afro-Americans, but at least 400 were Afro-West Indians from Barbados who emigrated in 1865 and settled together at Crozierville, 13 km inland from Monrovia.

By December 1875, when the expansion virtually ceased, Liberia allegedly stretched for 960 km along the Atlantic coast and between 320 and 400 km inland and hypothetically as far as the River Niger (see Fig. n.1). It embraced the Americo-Liberian and Recaptive settlements and peoples and the indigenous African ethnic groups and their territories.

Among the few governments to reply was that of the United States, to which Liberians particularly looked for intervention to secure 'a just arrangement' of the boundary question.

As indicated above, and for reasons already given above, the Liberian government was perennially nearbankrupt and owed huge debts to local and foreign creditors. By January 1908 Liberia's indebtedness to Britain comprised, according to the British Consul-General at Monrovia, £60000 a year 'for several years' while her indebtedness to German merchants in Liberia amounted to $120000 by September 1905. This indebtedness enabled the imperial powers to constantly interfere in the internal affairs of Liberia during the period under review in a way that they never did in Ethiopia where they were never provided with the cause nor the excuse so to do. Throughout the last three decades of the nineteenth century, the imperial powers sent mission upon mission to Liberia to offer aid to her to pay her debts if she would come under their protection. France did this in 1879, Germany in 1887 and Spain in 1886, and each power offered to regulate Liberia's finances, organize her defence, and establish and control her Frontier Force. At the same time, their resident ambassadors and representatives treated the Liberians with contempt and frequently imposed on her by denouncing her trade, customs and citizenship laws or bullying her to redress their nationals' grievances as Britain did in September 1869, August 1870, April 1871, February and June 1882, November 1886 and finally January 1909. 89 Germany similarly brought in her gunboats to intimidate Liberia in February and October 1881, in August 1897, January and September 1898 and December 1912. On each occasion, the German government demanded financial indemnity ranging between $3000 and $60000 from the Liberian government on mostly trivial grounds, particularly alleged 'insults' by Liberian officials to the German consul or German merchants in Liberia who invited the German intervention.\nThe three years 1907-9 witnessed an unprecedented escalation of this interference by Britain, France and Germany culminating in the famous 'Cadell Incident' of n and 12 February 1909.

Throughout the nineteenth century, Americo-Liberians' policy was to assimilate the indigenous Africans culturally and politically by 'civilizing' and Christianizing them, and giving them equal rights with the settlers. Although this was achieved to some extent with the Recaptives (who were much less numerous than the settlers), the Americo-Liberians, mindful of their own privileged position, main› tained tight political control over Liberia by restricting political participa› tion of even those indigenous Africans who were educated. Only very few of them were given the franchise on an equal footing with the AmericoLiberians (although these might themselves be illiterate and poor). The main indigenous African representation (mostly of the coastal Africans) in the Liberian Legislature as from 1875 consisted of African chiefs designated 'referees' (or 'delegates'), after their chiefdoms had paid an annual 'delegate fee' of $100 to the Liberian government. As the delegates 'spoke' through an interpreter solely on ethnic matters and could not vote, they had very little influence on government policy.$^{8}$ Hence both the educated Africans and the chiefs resented their restricted representation. Furthermore the Liberian government sought to maximize its import and export duties and other levies on trade and shipping which constituted its main sources of revenue. To facilitate collection and control of the external trade by Americo-Liberian merchants, from 1839 the government restricted foreign merchants to trade at only six Americo-Liberian portsof-entry. The restrictions and levies alienated both the foreign merchants who resented them, and the indigenous African chiefs who had formerly controlled the external trade and levied the dues. Often, the foreign merchants and chiefs combined to resist or defy the trade restrictions and levies, or to appeal to European states to intervene on their behalf. Thus, at various times during the nineteenth century, the Vai, Kru and Grebo of the Liberian coast put up an armed resistance to Liberian government impositions on their trade. 9"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': 'European aggression on Liberian and Ethiopian territory, 1880-1914 > Liberia', 'content': ""Apparently envious of the French gain of Liberian territory in 1907, Britain also insisted on acquiring the Kanre-Lahun district and in September 1908, instructed Major Le Mesurier, the Briton commanding the British troops stationed at Kanre-Lahun, to forbid the Liberian commissioners in the Kanre-Lahun district to perform administrative functions other than the collection of customs duties. A month later, Le Mesurier ordered them to remove their customs posts and to leave KanreLahun altogether, as according to him, the new Liberian frontier with Sierra Leone was to be marked by the natural boundaries of the Moa and Mafissa rivers. 34 Between November 1909 and early 1910, the Liberian government tried in vain to secure the Kanre-Lahun district from the British by persuasion. 35 The matter was finally settled in January 1911 by an Anglo-Liberian treaty, by which Britain retained the Kanre-Lahun district but ceded to Liberia the much less desirable territory between the Morro and Mano rivers and paid £4000 'compensation' to the Liberian government with which to develop the territory ceded (see Fig. 11.3).

These included an upward revision of the tariff, the reopening of the Liberian hinterland to foreign traders (closed to foreigners since the outbreak of the First World War), and the raising of port and harbour dues.$^{43}$ Simultaneously, the Liberian government welcomed plans by the Universal Negro Improve› ment Association, an American-based nationalist movement of New World blacks led by the Jamaican, Marcus Garvey, to bring capital and black immigrants to Liberia to develop her resources. But those plans never materialized. 44 Fortunately for Liberia, as from late 1923, the performance of the Liberian economy gradually improved.

Firestone obtained from the Liberian government the right to lease for ninety-nine years up to one million acres in Liberia to grow and export rubber, and Liberia secured a loan of $5000000 from the Finance Corporation of America to develop infrastructure including roads, hospitals and schools, as well as to pay her debts.$^{48}$ The loan, which received United States government support, greatly increased the influence of Firestone and the United States in Liberia."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Foreign intervention in Liberia and Ethiopia, 1915-35 > Liberia', 'content': 'First, the Liberian government\'s penury and perennial indebtedness partly led to increased foreign control of Liberia\'s financial administration by the International Receivership, the Bank of British West Africa, and Firestone interests supported by the United States government.

Having failed in an attempt to settle at Sherbro, they sought and found refuge on Providence Island, at the mouth of the Mesurado river, and finally on Cape Mesurado, where now stands the capital of the republic.\n\nThe second decade, commencing with 1830, might be called the period of expansion, when the colony at Cape Mesurado feeling itself sufficiently well established began to send out colonies, and planted the settlements at Bassa and Sinoe on the coast, and Millsburg and Caldwell on the St. Paul's.\n\nThe third decade, commencing with 1840, might be called the period of consolidation or independence. During this period the necessity was pressed upon the scattered settlements of not only closely co-operating but of declaring themselves one independent state under the name and style of the Republic of Liberia. It was during this period that the last white governor died, and the colonial Government was assumed and conducted (for five years) by one of the colonists under the direction of the American Colonization Society until July, 1847, when the colony became an independent Republic.\n\nThe fourth decade commences with 1850, and might be called the period of diplomatic extension. It was during this period that most of our treaties with foreign nations were formed, and we became known to the European world.\n\nThe fifth decade begins with 1860, and might be called the agricultural period. It was during this decade that, through the large accessions of recaptured Congoes, our farmers were enabled to extend their cultivation of the soil and prove what was before doubted, that exclusive devotion to the soil will yield a comfortable living and a competence in Liberia.\n\nThe sixth decade begins with 1870, and might be called the period of upheaving. It was during this decade now just closed that the Republic experienced the most serious strain on its domestic and foreign relations; when the thoughtful at home were alarmed and our friends abroad were anxious.

The liberated slave represented the best elements of the negro population of his day. At the same time, in America, there was no place for him. He could not enjoy the privileges of a white man, he had lost the legal protection of his master; he was in fact neither slave nor free. It was to meet his wants that the Liberian enterprise was organised. None but liberated slaves were, at first, permitted to take part in it. Many of them were well educated and possessed advantages which might have made life in America more attractive than the hardships and dangers of a colonising experiment. White men were in the first instance excluded from citizenship in the new colony, and for many years Liberia was simply what it professed to be—a community of negroes, who sought in Africa the enjoyment of a freedom that could be only nominal in America.\n\nNotwithstanding the care taken the first band of settlers had to fight for their existence and owed the victory which established them upon the coast to the aid of an English man-of-war. Thus England saved the life of the young colony, and in the sequel the bond then established between them has never been forgotten on either side. In 1824 the town which the settlers had raised received the name of Monrovia bestowed upon it in honour of the then President of the United States. At the same time the social condition of the colonists gave the name of Liberia to their settlement. The colony flourished, agriculture was developed; a policy of trade with the natives and road and bridge making was inaugurated with much success, and in 1828 a charter of government which contained the germ of a more elaborate constitution was issued by the Colonisation Society. From the beginning the principle of self-government was recognised in a liberal manner. The agent and vice-agent alone were nominated by the Society, all subordinate officers were elected by the Colony, but the vote was restricted to landowners. The ""Maryland Colonisation Society"" had established another community on the same coast, in which the sale of intoxicating liquors was entirely forbidden. To these in 1833 and 1835 was added a Quaker colony from Pennsylvania, under whose auspices a detachment of artisans came to form part of the population of the State. The new arrivals settled in Grand Bassa, and in 1839 Liberia was divided into two counties, Montserrado, containing the capital, and Grand Bassa.

President Roberts, who undertook a tour through Europe for the purpose of obtaining the recognition of the Powers, was well received in England, and was not only able to conclude a commercial treaty, but was accepted as an ally in the prosecution of the campaign against the slave trade on the West African coast, and was presented with a gunboat to enable him to carry on the repression of the traffic in Liberian waters. He, in 1849, took an active part in an expedition of the Powers against the slade traders, who had their headquarters in the northern territory lying between Liberia and Sierra Leone. It was felt that if the whole coast could be held under anti-slavery supervision the trade might be extirpated, and in 1850 the West Coast territory to Cape Turner was purchased from the owners and placed under the guardianship of Liberia. Robertsport was founded this year, and commemorates the name of the President. The population of the Republic was rapidly increasing, her territory was extended towards the interior by treaties with the chiefs, and in 1857 the colony of Maryland was by its own request annexed. They now form together the United States of Liberia. Trade and agriculture were encouraged, and order, justice, and civilised institutions spread through the Republic. The restriction by which white men were forbidden to hold land was also removed. Towns were multiplied and exploration of the interior began to attract attention.

Five hundred, perhaps, at the most. It lies far away from the routes pursued by tourists, and the busy world hears little and knows less of the independent negro State which nestles in a corner of the West African Coast and has been the scene of a series of experiments absolutely unique in history. It was from this part of the African coast that some attempt was to be made to develop the Dark Continent. Emancipated slaves from the United States, now citizens of a republic established by themselves in the land of their forefathers, were to be the torchbearers of civilisation and to carry the lamp of learning to their brethren in the interior. Such was the scheme of the large-hearted and liberal philanthropists who, early in the present century, founded the various colonisation societies in the United States with a view of enabling its negro population to found settlements on the West Coast of Africa. These settlements were gradually formed, and, after passing through a series of trials, eventually confederated. In 1822 the republic was declared, and in 1847 Liberia was recognised as an independent State by the sovereigns of Europe and the United States Government. From Washington the new State borrowed its constitution. Although she has enjoyed the advantage of having had at least three Presidents—E. Johnson, Russworm, and Roberts—of high character and executive ability, it would be untrue to say that the hopes of the founders of Liberia have been realised. On the contrary the Liberian Government seems to have entirely failed to win the confidence or even to gain the respect of the native kings and tribes within its supposed ""sphere of influence""; indeed, some of them resist all attempts to enforce authority within the ill-defined boundaries of the State. At the recent inauguration of the new President—the Hon. — Cheeseman—it was a matter of general satisfaction that a gunboat, ordered from a Keil dockyard, was on her way out from Germany. This boat is to be the foundation of the new Liberian Navy, and, strange to say, it is required, not for the defence of the State, but to coerce a British merchant who for three years has declined to pay customs duty on the ground that he receives no protection from Government, that there is no civilised administration in the district in which he resides, and that he is compelled to employ and pay a police force of his own. The Government, urged by German merchants to suppress their independent competitor, has signified its intention of resorting to force, and will probably find itself in a difficulty with our Foreign Office if a single shot is fired on an English factory whose owner is considered to have made out a good case for non-payment of duty. The attempts of Christian missionaries to evangelise the Western districts of Africa have been discouraging. From the year 1481, when some priests from Rome unsuccessfully endeavoured to withstand the climate, the history of Christian labour is one continuous narrative of a futile struggle against disease and death. Protestant societies in the United States have literally poured dollars by thousands into Liberia. Some good work is being done by white ministers who have formed thriving settlements up the country (where the land is fertile and the climate healthy), and have urged upon the natives the importance of cultivating rice, corn, potatoes, ginger, sugar, coffee, and arrowroot, all of which are remunerative crops. As for cotton, indigo, pepper, pineapples, and gumtrees, they grow wild, and the superior knowledge of the missionaries has enabled the natives to gather them profitably. But Christian workers have to reckon with a foe more stubborn than Paganism. Islam is gradually winning its way towards the West Coast from the interior. The sword, it is true, goes hand in hand with the green banner, but the African negro is a ready convert. He finds the precepts of the Prophet easy to understand, and the sanction of polygamy is in entire accord with his present practice. Moreover, where Mahomet gains ground, intemperance—which unhappily follows Christian missions—disappears. I have said that Liberia is fertile. It is certainly the richest district in West Africa, but it is terribly neglected, and can never thrive under its present administration. There is practically no Government. The rule of the negro is marked by selfishness and corruption. The colonisation societies in the United States have almost abandoned in despair sending out more emigrants who, on landing, finding themselves free from control, quickly become lazy and wholly useless as pioneers for opening up fresh country. It must be confessed, therefore, that, after a trial of seventy years, the American negroes have failed to erect a State worthy of the name. They have lost what little credit they had twenty years ago—not even the interest is paid on the loan of 500,000 dols. raised in London in 1870—and Liberia is gradually drifting into the hands of a few wide-awake German merchants, who are understood to have made advances to Government against valuable securities, as well as to have exerted sufficient influence in Berlin to induce General Caprivi to protest in vigorous language against the concession known as the ""indiarubber monopoly,"" granted by President Johnson to an English syndicate of company promoters under circumstances which have been severely criticised.

The civilised population at this time numbered about 5,000, but Liberia's position as a State in Africa resembled that of its founders as individuals in America. It had no legal existence among the nations. This fact was made apparent by the refusal of foreign ships to pay the duties imposed by its Legislature. The natives of the coast continued to harass it in consequence of its opposition to the slave trade, until the new State found itself between an upper and a nether millstone. Governor Roberts applied himself to overcome each difficulty in turn. He succeeded in persuading the native chiefs to appreciate the advantages of civilisation, and a number were induced to federate for the purpose of abolishing slavery and introducing orderly administration within their borders. The federated body shortly afterwards entered the colony, and in 1845 the territory of the Kroomen was annexed by friendly treaty, thus adding a third county, under the name of Sinou, to the two which already existed. The colony now extended to Grand Sesters. Maryland also widened the area of her administration, and the entire coast was occupied from Cape Mount to San Pedro. The two colonies resolved to make a joint effort at self-assertion. They imposed an ad valorem customs duty of 6 per cent. upon foreign imports, but English merchants refused to admit the right of the Liberians to impose duties, and insisted upon trading freely as with a savage territory. An English ship was seized and detained by the Liberian authorities. It was rescued by force, and the English Government refused to recognise the Liberian Executive. Liberia had no position except as a dependency of the United States, and the prejudice against colour in America caused that Government to give only lukewarm support to the African colony. If it were to exist at all, it was necessary that it should assert its individuality and claim for itself the rights which were denied to it. Under these circumstances the American Colonisation Society came to the resolution to abandon all rights over its protégé and advised it to take its fate boldly into its own hands. A Republican constitution was drawn up, and on August 24, 1847, the existence of the Republic of Liberia was announced to the world."", 'last_edit_date': '1892-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1892#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.733, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Progress of Liberia', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Every true friend of Africa and its peoples must feel a deep interest in Liberia. The first independent civilized African State on the West Coast, she occupies a position of great honour and usefulness. With institutions framed on the model of those of the United States of America, she stands out boldly before the world asserting and proving that there is no lack of natural ability in the civilized African to work the machinery of free institutions. Her President, her judges, her learned professors, are Christian Africans; no white man holds any political position in the country; the nation is essentially negro, and is so far from feeling any need of European or American aid in carrying on the various departments of her government, that she does more than discourage, she prohibits the permanent settlement of white men within her borders. They may come there for purposes of trade, but they are not permitted to acquire landed property; African she is, and exclusively African she is determined to remain. The enemies and libellers of the African race not unfrequently point to Liberia with contempt and ridicule, because she has not obtained in infancy the development of manhood; because, having no capital but what has been created by the industry of her own people, she is not able to undertake those works of civilization which are so much needed for the rapid development of her great natural resources; because, amid the abundant elements of wealth existing in her rich tropical fertility, and with her capability of producing so many objects that Europe requires and is compelled to seek even at the opposite side of the world, her Government is poor, and her revenue insufficient, without constant patriotic self-denial on the part of her principal citizens, for the support of those establishments indispensable to a free Christian State, which includes within her borders a native heathen population more than twenty times exceeding in number the civilized population of which the State really consists. But so far from there being anything in her public condition to justify contempt and ridicule such as our ignorantly-learned anthropologists would heap upon her and her people, every impartial man will find cause in her for wonder and felicitation that a mere handful of people brought to the African Coast from the degrading servitude of the late Slave States of the great American Republic should have fallen into so few errors, and have made such rapid progress. For it must be especially borne in mind that no comparison between Liberia and an English colony would be fair. An English colony, however small the number of emigrants and their descendants may be, is constantly and from its very birth receiving assistance from realized British capital. But the African emigrants from the United States to Liberia have not had any such resources at their back. They or their fathers have been slaves; and their only means of reaching Liberia was by the gift of a free passage, with six months free support after arrival, by the Colonization Society which founded this refuge for emancipated slaves on the West Coast of Africa. There have been no African Crusoes to help to build up this African Republic; the wealth, whatever it may be, within her is only the surplus of what her own people have created, over and above what they required for their own support. The progress thus made must necessarily be slow in comparison with that of an English colony anywhere, although it may be, as it has been in reality, rapid when viewed only in connexion with the elements available for promoting it. But we hope and believe that the time is now approaching when that progress will be greatly stimulated. Liberia, formed of American Africans, strongly imbued with the Republican principles so extreme in the American people, is not likely to attract any new elements of wealth and population from any other country than that from which its present civilized population has been derived. Ardently desiring as we do to see a rapid advance in Liberia, we rejoiced when we foresaw, as an inevitable consequence of the civil war in the United States, an increased emigration of emancipated Africans from those states to Liberia. The extreme change in the position of the late slaves in America, who have been so suddenly elevated from a debasing bondage, from a condition in which they were estimated rather as beasts than as men, to the full privileges of citizenship, political as well as social, has, however, retarded that movement toward Africa which would otherwise have impelled large numbers of the emancipated to Liberia. Still, the desire to become citizens of an exclusively African Republic, and that in Africa, has been gradually spreading in America, and the Colonization Society, who sent a shipload of emigrants in November last, and another in May, will despatch their ship again in November next with a further addition of some 800 for the African Republic. From the published statements of the society we have reason to believe that 4,000 or 5,000 emigrants might have been sent to Liberia during the present year, instead of some 1,500, had the society been in possession of the requisite funds. We must express our hope that the Colonization Society will be able to obtain all the money it may require to realize the spontaneous desires of late American slaves to become Liberian citizens. It is only by a large increase in her civilized industrial population that Liberia can make rapid progress in production and wealth. She is limited to this source of increase by the elements of which she is composed, by the nature of her institutions, and the strong peculiarities of her people; and all who are desirous of seeing the West Coast countries and their peoples emerge from their barbarism and degradation and come within the sphere of Christian civilizing influences should assist the Colonization Society of the United States in conveying emigrants to Liberia. We had hoped that before 1870 her civilized population would there be increased to at least 50,000. She could with the assistance rendered by the society for six months after the arrival of the emigrants in Liberia have very well established the requisite number, or even a greater number, within her borders before that period could they have been sent to her; and such an addition to her civilized labourers on her coasts and the rich lands of her navigable rivers would, we are convinced, soon give to the carping libellers of the African race new and forcible evidence of the just claim of the African to the rights and sympathies of a common brotherhood with the hitherto more favoured European.', 'last_edit_date': '1867-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1867#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.721, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE FUTURE OF LIBERIA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We learn from New York that, from accounts received there, it is evident that Liberia is much agitated over the encroachments of European Powers in that part of Africa.\n\nThese are trying times for the Republic. The last advices received from Liberia show that there is much excitement in Monrovia over the encroachments of the French at Cape Palmas. The French crossed the frontier of Ashantee into Liberian territory and established military stations, which they have refused to leave. Unfortunately, there is no Power to which Liberia can look for protection, unless to the United States. The country is prosperous, and is making great headway in the direction of civilization and wealth; but the fear that the Republic will be swallowed up by some European Power tends greatly to check the progress and development of the country. The Republic is a market for almost every kind of American manufactured goods and of foods. In return the United States gets its palm oil, palm kernels, dye woods, ivory, and coffee, and should a line of steamers be established to run regularly between New York and Liberia the country might become a centre for the shipping of many of the products of Africa, its chief port being convenient as a central depot from which they could be shipped to the United States. The caravans which bring ivory and other products from the interior of Monrovia return bearing American calico, bacon, and general manufactures; but as yet the only means of direct communication between Liberia and the United States is a line of sailing vessels. The mails are brought indirectly by way of England, and are very irregular.

It has, therefore, given us great satisfaction to hear that there are now on the banks of the St. Paul\'s River alone 458 acres of land under sugar-cane cultivation, of which above 100 acres have been planted this year. The estimate of crop which has been sent to us from these plantations seems to be, however, very low; so low, that we think there must be some error, unless a larger portion of the cane than we are aware of is of too recent planting to give good crops this season. The produce is returned at 307 tons of sugar and 160 tons of molasses. The plantation of one of our correspondents alone has produced 100 tons. We should have been glad to see the cotton industry well established in Liberia; but as sugar planting has been preferred, and as both soil and climate are admirably adapted for the cane, we expect shortly to find Liberia among the great sugar-producing countries. Natal—the account of this year\'s crops of sugar in which we published last month—should stir the Liberians to emulation.\n\nWe are glad to see that merchant ships on the coast, and the passengers in mail steamers, are subscribing, though not very liberally, to that admirable institution, St. Mark\'s Hospital, at Cape Palmas.\n\nOur friends of the Mendi Mission at the Sherboro, who have lately paid a visit to Cape Palmas, make the following satisfactory report.

The farming interest is becoming general; leading men are taking hold of the matter with determination.

Bush is all that meets the eye, while not a sail is to be seen as far as the eye can reach. There are no towns of any size between Grand Bassa and Harper, but merely a few villages scattered at intervals along the coast. Harper is situated on Cape Palmas, and has a harbour immediately opposite, which is sufficiently commodious and affords ships cruising in this part of the world a pleasant change after the eternal surf of the West African shores. The town looks uncommonly well from the sea. The church spires peep out from amongst the trees, and the shingle-framed houses of the Liberians surrounded by gardens add picturesqueness to the scene. Harper possesses, besides old churches, an academy, a hospital, an orphan asylum, and a lighthouse. The latter is more of ornament than use, as the Republic cannot afford to keep it constantly lighted. Adjacent to the lighthouse is the flagstaff which bears the Liberian national flag, the same as the American ensign, with the exception that instead of many stars there is only one. The practically prohibitive taxation at present imposed by the Government will end in the withdrawal of all Europeans from the country, as it is now an impossibility to get at the interior of the country, and the amount of trade that can be indulged in at the open ports is not sufficiently remunerative in view of the heavy taxation imposed. At present the German traders are anxiously expecting the arrival of the German squadron from Europe, when they are hoping the Admiral in command will bring the requisite pressure to bear on the authorities to induce them to open out to them the interior of the country. The people here may be called prosperous; if they would not ape white men\'s ways, they would be all the better. Some are well educated, and quite *au fait* in the politics of the world, but they appear to have a great dislike to foreigners of any kind, and a wish to keep Liberia wholly and solely for the Liberians. It should be pointed out that the effect of present restrictions is to keep Liberia utterly impotent to enforce her authority within her territory, and to prevent her doing anything to advance the material condition of the country, and that if this policy be persisted in, the inevitable result would be that Liberia would be absorbed by a European Power. The Americans washed their hands of a Liberian protectorate years ago, and are not likely to embroil themselves with any Power over such a figment as ""Liberian independence."" The officials of the Republic are wretchedly paid. The Governor of Harper\'s income is only about £75 a-year; his house is furnished in the meanest style, and he appears to augment his salary by supplying ships with fresh provisions. The constitution of Liberia, as well as the institutions, the manners and customs of the people, and the language itself, appear to be modelled upon those of the United States. The pure Liberian guesses and calculates quite as much as do his white brothers in New York, and speaks with that nasal twang peculiar to the land of the stars and stripes. Manhood suffrage is one of the Liberian institutions, but this ""manhood suffrage"" involves the qualification of being possessed of real property to the extent of fifty dollars. Harper exports little but palm oil, and that little appears to be dwindling to still lower limits. The inhabitants appear to take a deep interest in politics, and elections and the state of parties seem to create as deep and universal interest here as in more civilized countries. A Liberian youth of sixteen or so being asked how often the President was elected, replied ""biennially,"" and proceeded to give an account of the political institutions of the country, which showed that the education of the Liberian youth is thorough, and embraces politics as well as more widely-taught subjects. The President of the Republic resides at Monrovia, the capital, where the Houses of Assembly sit. The salary attached to the Presidential office is only £400 a-year and a residence—not a very magnificent sum, but large enough in this country, where living is cheap, the expenses of life small. The solitary Englishman in Liberia is located at a place called Tabon, and is engaged in trading with the natives. He has for some time refused to pay the exorbitant taxes assessed upon him, and the Government has no force to compel him, with the result that many of the natives are inclined to follow his example. As the Government has no means of transport, they are unable to send any troops from Monrovia to Tabon, from which it is distant about 200 miles, and, probably, even if they could, they would hesitate to do so from fear of complications with the English Government, especially as the boundaries of Liberia are not at present clearly defined, and her Majesty\'s Government has declined to recognize any portion of the country to be Liberian territory when the Government of the country is not capable of enforcing its authority. The officials say that the President has invoked the assistance of the United States, and that an American ship is at present on its way to Tabon, to set matters right; but the Americans are much too cute to trouble themselves over such a paltry matter. A wide and deep river runs into the sea here, but it is ruined by a bar at its mouth, which prevents navigation. This matters little at the present time, but in the future, when Liberia has been annexed or roused from its present state of stagnation, means will probably be found to obviate this fatal impediment to navigation, both here and elsewhere, along the coast. A very few miles off, another large river—the Carallo—discharges itself into the sea, and is likely to become of great commercial importance in the future, as gold washings have been found on its banks. This river has been ascended for nearly 200 miles, and is stated to be navigable for that distance. This country is more valuable in every way than our Gold Coast Colony: it possesses three or four fairly good harbours, whereas the latter cannot boast of one. There is an absence of that terrible surf which makes landing or the transference of cargo almost impossible, and the country itself appears to be more productive, to have greater mineral wealth, and to ""tap"" a more valuable part of the Dark Continent. The estimated population of Liberia is about 767,000, only about 30,000 of whom are descendants of freed slaves from the United States, the remainder being the aborigines or ""heathen,"" as they are termed by the ""Liberians.""', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LANDS IN LIBERIA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'may help to develop the great natural resources of their rich and extensive territories. What has been already done by Liberians in sugar and coffee cultivation, and other branches of agricultural industry, is invaluable under these circumstances, as showing what an admirable field there is in Liberia for the judicious employment of capital under a settled government. There is a large aboriginal population ready for employment by those who may possess the means of payment for labour, not only in planting and securing crops, but in those indispensable accessories in new countries—the formation of roads, improving the navigation of rivers, and introducing that machinery which adds so much to the efficiency of manual labour. For all these accessories, capital realized elsewhere is absolutely necessary. Without that capital in the hands of the community, the government of Liberia has been, like the fabled Tantalus, surrounded by the life-giving element, but unable to appropriate it for its own use and safety. It has been suffering from a painful thirst of revenues which can only be supplied by the development of natural resources, and the opening up and utilizing land and water routes of communication with the interior, by means of which the produce of the soil may be conveyed with speed and at moderate cost to its sea-ports for shipment to the European and American markets.

Yet when the facts of the culture being in its infancy and of there being no banks nor other financial institutions to assist the growers, and no machinery, except in a few instances, are considered, I am of the opinion that our cultivators have made a tolerable good showing in foreign markets. The total product for 1887 was about 1,200,000 lbs., which are distributed as follows: to Germany, 606,000 lbs.; United States, 301,000 lbs.; Belgium, France, and England, 149,000 lbs.; Holland and 150,000 lbs.""\n\nBishop William Taylor, in his Quadrennial Report, states: ""The productive interests of Liberia are fairly prosperous.

For years a popular feeling in favour of emancipation has been growing; but now the government has suddenly moved in the matter and the glorious deed is done.

Efforts to effect stoppage of the trade led to new activities by British traders, consuls, and naval officers, resulting in new relationships with the delta states.

For the delta states, these developments meant the demonstration of British power in their waters, bringing the era of gunboat diplomacy in which the British consuls used naval power to negotiate favourable conditions for British traders, missionaries, and explorers. In practice, the consuls, especially after 1850, continued and stepped up a policy started in the 1830s by Edward Nicolls, Governor of Fernando Po, of signing treaties with the local chiefs.$^{6}$ These treaties stipulated the stoppage of the slave trade by the rulers; the adoption of 'legitimate trade', that is, trade in goods other than slaves; laid down regulations for the conduct of legitimate trade; specified the sums of customs duties or comey to be paid by the traders, as well as subsidies that the British government was to pay the local rulers for their agreement to give up the slave trade.\nThese British activities on the coast gradually eroded the power of the local rulers, especially when the consuls and naval officers assisted the British traders to set up their own judicial systems over and above the law of the local states, the so-called Courts of Equity, composed mainly of British traders with the participation of a few local House Heads or chiefs.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century.

France imported an average of 4000 tonnes a year between 1847 and 1856 and 2000 tons in the following decade.

Something that had long been an abstract Utopian ideal - an alternative to the slave trade, a substitute for trade in men - had at last materialized. It remained to develop production on an industrial scale; and this took no longer than it had taken the Cuban and Brazilian plantations to reach full production of sugar and coffee. The main producing areas corresponded to the best slave-exporting areas, from Dahomey$^{44}$ to the rivers of the Niger delta and Cameroon. One of the essential features of the changeover was that manpower was mobilized on land that had been internally colonized. This admittedly meant that production was by means of a form of slavery, but within an African social and economic context. In fact the energetic development of this economic novelty did not immediately disrupt the traditional economy: slave trade and oil trade co-existed side by side. A more extensive system of barter began to radiate into the interior. On the coast the same agents for the Western trade still kept their grip on the market: they understood purchasing, gave credit, circulated traditional currencies, and introduced metal coinage. The increase in the number of people competing for trade upset the internal balance and led to a realign› ment of forces.$^{4S}$ These economic changes were accelerated by religious and cultural factors causing distortions, which were never very far removed from politics, which helped, however, to put an end to the trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""Indeed, the Dahomey authorities could not appreciate the demand which several British and French abolitionist delegations made on them to stop the trade, given the willingness of the Brazil-based Portuguese dealers to continue transacting the business in Dahomey ports.\nNevertheless, Dahomey realized that changes were taking place. Its adjustment to changing times was noticeable from the mid-century when, under the influence of a French trading firm, Victor RØgis, King Gezo (c. 1818-58) of Dahomey was persuaded to intensify the trade in palm oil, first as a supplement to the export of slaves and eventually as the dominant factor in the state's export economy.$^{41}$ The transition from slave to 'legi› timate' trade meant a corresponding increase in the need to retain war captives as labour for the maintenance and expansion of the palm oil industry. Slaves also came to be used more for transporting goods from the interior to the coast and vice-versa than as commodities for export. By the time of the French conquest of 1892-4, the foundation of Dahomey's new economy - the monoculture of palm produce - had already been laid.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa.

This policy, coinciding as it did with Radama's own determination to expand to the east, was to have, as one writer has put it, 'important consequences for the future of Madagascar'. 12 After several friendly contacts, Farquhar sent a diplomatic mission, led by Captain Le Sage, which arrived in Antananarivo on 21 December 1816.

Their learned observation endorses the popular view. But the proposition needs explanation. Humanitarianism is a Western ideology, and it is unlikely to have found any place in the minds of African distributors of the time - with very rare exceptions. But this does not mean that they were constitutionally incapable of giving up the trade, as Western supporters of slavery maintained. The continuance of the supply of exportable manpower from Africa can be logically explained in economic terms. That the distributors were black and the exporters white is irrelevant: it was a paying proposition, profitable to both trading partners, whose sole object was to make money. That was the situation at the grass roots. The continuance of the supply is to be explained in terms of the efficient working of an integrated system: and what Africans were resisting was the disruption of this system. For one thing, it would have ruined the established business of the distributors,$^{31}$ who had no other prospects, to say nothing of the chain of repercussions it would have set off on the social and political structure, both locally and further afield. In other words, so long as the barter system between the hinterland and the coast, and the coast's foreign trade, had no clear alternative to the slave trade, opposition by African slave-traders to its suppression was dictated strictly by the imperative needs to avoid commercial chaos.$^{32}$ The supposed complicity of the African distributors was no more than a reflex reaction to the immediate economic situation. This also explains the fall in the selling price of exportable manpower: it was the market's defence against growing pressure from the forces of suppression. The latter thus helped to contribute to an unsatisfactory situation. This argument needs to be modi› fied when the exportation of Africans to the north or east is considered. While the economic interests of the slave hunters and distributors are selfevident in this case too, it is hard to see what kind of economic compensa› tion accrued to the countries that were plundered. Certain individuals with strong personalities were able to consolidate their power, men like Tippu Tip, for instance, or Rabeh. But any benefits that may have been conferred on the regions under their control still have to be identified by specialists."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 61, 'article_title': 'Hope in Dahomey', 'full_section_title': 'Hope in Dahomey', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1862#article-15', 'issue_date': '23_12_1862', 'content': '\n\nshe has been so richly endowed by nature.

We cannot forget that, on those 1,000 slaves alone, the King obtains a fancied profit of some 10,000l., which we enable the Cuban planters to send him, through the slave-traders, for the supply of the raw material out of which they manufacture sugar for us.

We do not hesitate to say that 20,000l. a-year might be levied by duties on imports at Whydah. We do not wish to prejudge the results of Captain Willmott's visit to Abomey. Our correspondent at Whydah tells us that there is hope of amicable relations with Dahomey, and of the slave-trade being put an end to there. We are only too willing to share in this hope. But we think it right to show that, should the hope not be realised, there are still means for annihilating the slave-trade in the Bight of Benin, without any very heavy charge upon the home exchequer. And annihilated in the Bight of Benin the slave-trade never will be, while Cuba continues to import slaves, until the shipment of slaves from Dahomey and along the coast to the Volta be rendered impossible by the constant influence of British authority there. It is estimated that the revenue of the King of Dahomey from the slave-trade, and from licenses to trade and export duties at Whydah, amounts to 500,000 dollars a-year. One merchant at Whydah pays him 20,000 dollars a-year for a license to trade. It would be absurd for us to shut our eyes to these facts. If we cannot obtain the discontinuance of slave importation in Cuba, we must put an end to slave exportation from the coasts of Dahomey. And we understand that although the Kings of Porto Novo and Badagry are no longer mixed up actually with the slave-trade, they allow it to be carried on by Portuguese at their towns. And this reminds us that we have never yet received any explanation as to the grounds upon which we levy duties at Badagry. We give in another column a copy of a protest sent to Governor Freeman by the merchants of Badagry, when the duties, since modified and amended, were first ordered to be levied there. We do not defend the language employed by the protesting parties. But it shows that they were smarting under a keen sense of wrong done to them, according to their belief. We are not in possession of the Governor's reply to that protest. We must presume it will have shown the grounds on which he justified his order, and treated Badagry as a British possession, by levying duties there in the Queen's name, at a time when there was actually a British Vice-Consul there. We are aware that since the publication of our October article the Vice-Consul has been converted into a resident British agent; that his brother has been appointed magistrate; that a force of twelve native policemen are placed at the service of these authorities; and that the King and chiefs relinquish all right to levy duties, in consideration of a certain annual sum to be paid them by the Governor of Lagos. But we do not know whether in the document relinquishing that right, or in any other, they acknowledge themselves subjects of Queen Victoria.""}, {'id': 112, 'article_title': 'DAHOMEY', 'full_section_title': 'DAHOMEY', 'last_edit_date': '01-08-1863', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1863#article-19', 'issue_date': '23_02_1863', 'content': 'Whydah, January 8, 1863.\n\nSir,—There is nothing hardly worth writing, except a new ""custom"" which the King has been making for his father\'s spirit, since I wrote you last.

The African-Aid Society have especially reason to congratulate themselves on the justness of their views with regard to Dahomey. It is now more than two years since they memorialised Her Majesty's Government to send a commissioner to the King of that country. Although assailed on all sides by doubts as to the personal safety of any person who might be thus sent, they have never wavered, and at every convenient opportunity have reiterated that request. Their information respecting both King and people was too certain to allow them to participate in any fear. They knew that what the King desired in his heart, above all other things, was, that some Englishman, clothed with command, and bringing a direct message from the British Government, should come to him. His pride and dignity were involved in his obtaining this virtual recognition from England, similar to that which his father had received. Their memorial prayed, moreover, that, if necessary, a subsidy might be granted to the King, to cease whenever legitimate trade should have brought him a revenue equal to that he would have abandoned in giving up and assisting us in destroying the slave-trade, at our request.\n\nThe reception of Commodore Wilmot by the King of Dahomey, his chiefs and people, has set at rest the question of the accessibility of that monarch to the remonstrances and counsels of England. Our prestige there is very great. All were jealous of the preference which we seemed to give to Abeokuta. That envenomed the feelings of the Dahomans against the Abeokutans, and the very decided terms in which the former spoke to Commodore Wilmot on the subject show that there is but little chance of peace between the two until the issues of another foray into the Egba country shall have been tried. We deeply deplore that Commodore Wilmot could not obtain an abandonment of the King's designs against Abeokuta. But, notwithstanding the state of isolation from England in which the Abeokutans have placed themselves, by their unjustifiable and offensive rejection of Mr. Vice-Consul Taylor, and their subsequent proceedings, they ought to be perfectly able to protect their town against troops on whom a three weeks' march without commissariat supplies must tell with most enfeebling effect.""}, {'id': 155, 'article_title': 'THE ASHANTEE WAR, THE RELIEF OF ABEOKUTA, AND THE SECOND RAID AT EPE.', 'full_section_title': 'THE ASHANTEE WAR, THE RELIEF OF ABEOKUTA, AND THE SECOND RAID AT EPE.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-10', 'issue_date': '23_05_1863', 'content': ""The return of the Dahomans to their country without daring to attack Abeokuta gives cause for great thankfulness and rejoicing.

With regard to the question of Coolie emigration, he thought, speaking off-hand, that Her Majesty\'s Government had no right to interfere in the matter. With regard to the general position of Chinese emigrants in the various countries of the world, he apprehended that the real remedy to be applied—and he felt sure that it would in time be applied—would be to make the Chinese Government and people understand clearly the position in which emigrants from their country were treated in the countries to which they went. The free emigration of Chinese had been increasing very rapidly of late years. As was generally known, they were pouring very rapidly into California, and he thought free emigration was destined to supersede the old system of emigration under contracts. For his own part, he did not absolutely and unconditionally condemn this system, but he thought it required very carefully watching. When it was carried on by a Government which sanctioned and continued the practice of negro slavery, he had no doubt it was open to very gross and grave abuses. However, he did not see that the Government could do more on the subject than to bring to the knowledge of the Spanish Government any well-authenticated cases of oppression and abuse which came to their knowledge. With regard to the other questions, he must own to a feeling of difficulty in expressing any opinion with regard to the insurrection in Cuba. It had lasted a long time, had been conducted with very great pertinacity, and down to recent dates very little progress had been made in putting it down. On the other hand, he thought it at least premature to say that the war was ""fast culminating to a successful issue on the side of the insurgents,"" as stated in the memorial, and he did not think any proposal on the part of Her Majesty\'s Government at the present time to mediate between Spain and the insurgents would be looked upon in a favourable light by Spain. The feeling of high patriotism in Spaniards was very strong, and it was true of them, as of other peoples, that they did not always accurately measure their own strength. If Her Majesty\'s Government were to make any suggestion to Spain, their answer would probably be, ""We have got two civil wars on our hands at the same time, and our efforts are divided between the two; let us finish with the Carlists, and then we shall have all our forces disposable to put an end to the war in Cuba."" That, he had no doubt, would be the answer, and he could not blame the Spanish Government for making it. At the same time, if any prospect opened up of putting an end to the existing state of things, Her Majesty\'s Government would be very glad to avail themselves of it. (Hear, hear.) With regard to emancipation, he had no doubt that sooner or later it would come, and that the same conviction existed in the minds of slaveowners themselves, who were only fighting for a continuance of the system for a few years longer. At the same time he believed that emancipation in Cuba could not be accomplished by itself, but must be a part of a general and complete scheme for the pacification of the island. He could not therefore admit that the present time was specially favourable for English interference. If an opportunity should arise in which the good offices of England could be available, they would be most readily given. (Hear, hear.) In dealing with the domestic and internal affairs of other countries, it was not so wise to rush forward with advice as to wait until it was asked. He believed that what had been said in reference to the fact that the United States had no desire to annex Cuba was perfectly true, but at the same time he believed that the American Government and people would receive with considerable suspicion and jealousy any attempt on the part of England to interfere between Spain and Cuba, and would be apt to put a wrong construction upon it. He was sorry if he might have seemed to speak in a vague and undecided manner in reference to the questions brought before him. He could not, however, speak more positively. He had endeavoured to make clear the difficulties of the case, and for the rest he could only say that his sympathies and those of his colleagues were entirely with the objects which the deputation had in view.

He was really not in a condition to say more at present, but any one who had practical experience as to this class of cases would know that, however much two Governments might agree upon general principles, there were many questions of detail which would arise which would require careful consideration and with reference to some of which it might be necessary to take professional opinions.

New born, it entered the lists against the slave-trade wars and traffic, and the superstitious atrocities of Dahomey! Is it a just ground of reproach to it that it has not, in the short space of a couple of years, overcome the great iniquity which has now had nearly two centuries of life—not yet opened that magnificent country to industry and commerce? It has organised public opinion against it so as to claim the attention of Government, and incite it to action. Since the moment at which it struck the first blow at Dahoman atrocities, it has vigilantly watched for and taken advantage of opportunities for renewing the attack; and if supplied with the sinews of war, it will eventually triumph.\n\nIt asked and it obtained a consular establishment for Abeokuta, as the commencement of a system of interior consulates—of bringing a direct British action to bear upon the centres of production. It did not obtain it in the perfect form that it desired, and thence came whatever disappointment has ensued. Had a consul gone to Abeokuta in the name of the Queen of England, he would have been received and welcomed, while a vice-consul, going in the name of the unknown and unrecognised Governor of Lagos, failed to obtain acceptance. But the victory is only deferred, the vote for Abeokuta maintains its place in the estimates; and Abeokuta will receive ere long a consular organization, with the certainty of its producing a great increase of industrial and commercial exertions.\n\nIt desired to send artizans and agriculturists from Canada and the States. But this was opposed in Abeokuta by those who now deplore that there are no brick and tile-makers there—no handicraftsmen to instruct the youth in the mechanics of civilization. But since they were objected to there, it has purposed assisting some to Ambas Bay; there to form an industrial and mechanical nucleus for neighbouring states. Every element of success is to be found there. But the work cannot be done without money. The society cannot make bricks without straw, and it objects to spending 50l. in obtaining 100l. It has supplied funds for making the first commercial road ever attempted in native Africa, that forming by the Basle missionaries over the Aquapem Mountains, at the Gold Coast. It has been incessantly stimulating the Government to a system of roads in our African possessions of the Gold Coast, that will open those naturally wealthy districts to easy communication with the coast. For 150 years England was active in devastating and depopulating the Gold Coast; but during fifty years of better conduct she has not made five miles of road there! Government abandoned the Fort of Quittah, on the Slave Coast, to save 300l. or 400l. a-year. This led to a renewed slave-trade, and to 700 to 1,000 slaves a-year being carried past it into the lagoons, for shipment to Cuba. The society never relaxed its efforts till orders were sent out relative to the reoccupation of the fort.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'DAHOMAN ENVOYS TO ENGLAND', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We announced more than twelve months since that the King of Dahomey was very desirous to send some of his principal chiefs on a mission to this country. It seemed to us so advisable in the interests of African civilisation that he should be not only allowed, but encouraged and assisted to do so, that we have strenuously advocated the measure. In our May number we made some comments on a letter of the late Commodore on the West Coast station; in which, in pursuance, as we believed of orders from home, the King of Dahomey\'s request was refused. Our correspondence from Dahomey shows us, however, that the King has not accepted this reply of the Commodore as a final decision against him, but has applied directly by letter to Her Majesty\'s Government with the same object. In the article in our May number before alluded to we exposed the error and inconsistency of such a refusal as had been given to the King, and endeavoured once again to show how much that change which we so desire for Dahomey and Ashantee might possibly be forwarded by bringing some of the chief men of those countries into immediate personal contact with our advanced civilisation and all the humane institutions to which the blessed precepts of the Gospel of Peace have given rise among us. There is nothing more necessary to be shown to the authorities of those barbarous countries than the value which we attach to human life; and that although unhappily wars have not ceased among so-called Christian nations, human life is, except upon the battle-field, regarded as a sacred thing, in no case to be wantonly taken away, and in all cases to be hedged round by the supreme authority with all possible protections. We do not know what may be the decision of our Government, and what answer may be sent to the King of Dahomey. We have reason, however, to believe that the arguments put forward by us have not been without effect in modifying opinions in quarters where opposition to the King of Dahomey\'s wishes was known to exist. There is consequently reason to hope that a favourable answer may be accorded, at least to the extent of meeting the King\'s wishes that some of his chiefs should come over to this country, by offering those facilities without which it would be difficult, if not impossible, for them to do so. This, and a formal reception of such envoys by Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, are two very different things. If the latter could by any possibility be construed into an approval of, or even into a cessation of protest against, those horrible barbarities by which Dahomey is polluted, especially in those superstitious ""Customs"" in which human life is so wantonly destroyed, we should say at once that such envoys should not be admitted, either formally or informally, to the Royal presence; but if, as we think there is reason to believe, the personal displeasure of our Sovereign at such atrocities, pronounced by herself in presence of those envoys, might have the effect of inducing the King to put an end at once and for ever to his slave wars and to those appalling ""Customs"" for which Dahomey has become so infamously distinguished, we do venture to express the hope that in the event of the envoys arriving here, some means may be devised by which they may thus become assured of Her Majesty\'s abhorrence of things in which the Kings of Dahomey have delighted, and that Her Majesty considers those things in which they have gloried as incompatible with the existence of any friendly understanding, or interchange of courtesies between herself and him. We do think that some means may be devised by which such a Royal Christian effort might be made in the cause of humanity and of Christian civilisation in Africa without any sacrifice of Royal dignity. The end in view is really a great one. The cessation of slave-hunting wars and of ""Customs"" in Dahomey, and the entry of that country, however feeble at first its steps may be, into the ranks of the world\'s advancing Christian civilisation, would have a great effect on the surrounding countries. A new way would be opened through Dahomey into the interior of Africa. And as the Dahoman Government has long since shown itself alive to the importance of good roads between its principal places, more might possibly be done within a short time in that than in any other native African country in establishing improved communications between the coast and the interior. The visit of the Dahoman envoys to this country, and their judicious reception and entertainment here, are therefore much to be desired. It would be absurd, of course, to bring them over at this time of the year, when they would be exposed to the rigours of winter; but we hope that such an answer may be given to the King\'s application, and such instructions be issued and arrangements made, as may lead to the presence of those men among us some time in the months of May or June of next year.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-09-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_09_1866#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

Lagos has for many years had a large trade carried on by British and other European merchants, yet this did not prevent it from being at the same time the head-quarters of slavery in the Bights. At Whydah an extensive trade in palm-oil has existed since 1849, and yet slaves have been regularly shipped from that port up to the present day, and, as has been already stated, a cargo was awaiting embarkation there in December last. Nor is this difficult to explain; palm-oil, which forms the principle article of trade, is collected by natives, chiefly domestic slaves, residing at or near the coast, its weight and bulk preventing it from being brought from a great distance in a country where there are no rivers; and it is evident that it would answer the chiefs better to turn their labour to account in this way than to sell them for exportation, even were not the customs of the country entirely opposed to such a proceeding. There is nothing, however, to prevent the chiefs from purchasing for export any number of the slaves captured in the hunts which are regularly undertaken for this purpose in certain parts of the interior, and so legitimate commerce and the slave-trade may be found combined in any spot on the coast to which British authority or influence does not extend.\n\nThus the existence of the British settlements, and of the Republic of Liberia, has served to eradicate the slave-trade from all but one spot on the 1,500 miles of coast extending from the Gambia to Quittah; and the recent acquisition of Lagos may be said to have freed almost entirely from the curse the remainder of the coast; the two exceptions being the small spot between the Gambia and Sierra Leone, the case of which has already been referred to in the report on the latter colony, and a portion of the sea coast lying between Quittah and Lagos, immediately in the rear of which are the dominions of the notorious King of Dahomey.\n\nIt is well known that, from the peculiar circumstances of his country, this monarch is indebted for his wealth and the maintenance of his authority over his people almost exclusively to the slave-trade. Whydah, the chief seaport of his dominions, is, as it has always been, the principal place of export; and advantage is also taken, when the vigilance of the cruisers renders it necessary, of the independent towns of Great Popo, Aghway, and Little Popo, situated to the westward, the inhabitants of which are only too ready to afford every facility for a trade from which they derive such profit.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE DAHOMEY TREATY', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'to the degree of support, if any, they might receive in case of need from their own Government. All this is changed by the Treaty. British subjects have now a recognized station; they may visit, reside, and trade in Dahomey as of right; they are not to be annoyed, or inconvenienced, or impeded in their trade, either by the King of Dahomey, his subjects, or any foreigners within his dominions; and they may hire, occupy, and possess any houses or warehouses for the purposes of commerce. We do not underrate, nor do we think those engaged, or to be hereafter engaged, in commerce and trade with and in Dahomey will underrate the importance of these stipulations. We should have been glad, however, to see an additional one, which is unhappily absent, to the effect that no British subject, or his goods or produce, should be liable to any additional or increased payment or exaction over and above what may be demanded and taken from the subjects of any other foreign Power. The position and influence in Dahomey of the subjects of one other European Power—a position and influence dating from the time of the foreign slavetrade—rendered, we think, a ""most favoured nation"" clause as desirable in this treaty with Dahomey as in other treaties in which it has been from time to time inserted. The confirmation of pre-existing stipulations as regards the foreign slave-trade, was a matter of course. No British negotiations treating with such a State as Dahomey could possibly fail to reassert the determined opposition of Her Majesty\'s Government to any renewal of that odious traffic in human flesh, now, happily, almost extinct, so far as the West Coast of Africa is concerned; although during the last twelve months, and, unhappily, even in our last and this present number, we have had to expose desultory individual efforts, on the part, too, of British subjects, to revive and perpetuate it. But our most hearty thanks are due to Her Majesty\'s Government and to Commodore Sullivan for the stipulation in Article 6. Although unable, at present, to force the discontinuance of human sacrifices in Dahomey, it was well to place on record anew the British abhorrence of them, by demanding and obtaining for British subjects an exemption from those horrible commands which the King of Dahomey has been accustomed to make and enforce on Europeans at Whydah, that they should attend his abominable Customs, in which so many poor creatures are tortured and sacrificed, at the behests of a bloodthirsty superstition. Article 6 stipulates that ""no British subject shall henceforth be compelled to attend any of the Customs of the country of Dahomey where any human sacrifices are held."" This stipulation alone, even if the Treaty had not contained those other important ones on which we have commented, would have amply justified the remission of a portion of the fine imposed by Sir William Hewett, and to enforce payment of which the Dahoman coast was blockaded. Such a stipulation is cheap at 100 puncheons of oil; and we are quite sure Her Majesty\'s Government would have abandoned all claim to the other 400 puncheons, and even made an annual payment out of the Imperial Exchequer in addition, if King Gélélé would have undertaken, in consideration thereof, to abolish those human sacrifices which cause every humane mind to think of Dahomey with disgust and loathing. Article 6, however, is an insertion of the ""thin end of the wedge"" as regards that ruinous waste of human life, which makes Dahomey a curse, as well as an abomination, to her less bloodthirsty neighbours, and is tending rapidly to her own impoverishment, depopulation, and ruin.', 'last_edit_date': '1877-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1877#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.715, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'How to Treat Dahomey', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""We observe by our English journals, received per Ethiope, that the friends of Africa in England are greatly bestirring themselves in favour of our country.

Some anti-slavery journals appear to deprecate the use of force towards that monarch. They think that persuasion and entreaty should be brought to bear on him, with a view to induce him to desist from his practices of sacrificing human beings and engaging in slave-hunts. Persuasion, argument, and entreaty, have been repeatedly used on this present King of Dahomey and his predecessors, and used in vain. These kings tell us that it is the custom of their nation to hunt for slaves and to sacrifice human beings. He who is king is obliged to do these things. It is with him just as much a duty as the abiding by the advice of responsible ministers is with the Sovereign of Great Britain. If he abstained from these practices, his subjects would turn him out, and set up another man in his place, who would carry them out in accordance with immemorial usage. In order to put down these barbarous practices, only one course will avail—to use physical force. The British Government must say to the Dahomians, \'Sir, you are unwholesome in your habits and troublesome in your ways and practices. You won\'t live and let live. You go about kidnapping and killing people who never harmed you—who don\'t even know you. You prevent commerce, you hinder civilization, you create misery and desolation, you break up hundreds of thousands of happy families. This will not do. The world really can\'t get on in this manner.

Not only am I very glad to express hearty sympathy with the objects of this society and with the terms of this resolution, but it may be of interest to this meeting to hear that the British South Africa Company, of which I have the honour to be vice-president, is determined to act in the spirit of this resolution. One of my colleagues, Mr. Cawston, will start in a few days for Brussels to represent our Company at the Conference, and he will have an interview with the King of the Belgians, who has been in correspondence with myself. His Majesty is anxious to exchange views with regard to these important matters which interest this Society, and affect the Congo Free State as deeply as they do the South Africa Company. Our Company is anxious that it should be understood by the public that it does not consider it is merely a trade association. Of course it seeks to develop in every way and to the fullest extent the trade of South Africa, but it will never lose sight of the high functions it has undertaken—the civilisation and elevation of the aborigines of that country, where these unfortunate people have been too long the prey of unscrupulous European traders and brutal Arab man-stealers. In doing so we shall only be carrying out the terms of our charter, from which I should like to read two short clauses. They are these: ""The Company shall, to the best of its ability, discourage and, so far as may be practicable, abolish by degrees any system of slave trade or domestic servitude in the territories aforesaid. The Company shall regulate the traffic in spirits and other intoxicating liquors within the territories aforesaid, so as, as far as practicable to prevent the sale of any spirits or other intoxicating liquor to any native."" To these obligations we adhere, both in letter and spirit. It is only three months to-day since our charter was signed, and therefore I feel it would be premature to say anything about what we have done; but it will interest the meeting to hear that we are in cooperation with the African Lakes Company. We give them every assistance in carrying out the work which they are engaged in. I think it will be satisfactory for the country to hear that we intend, in co-operation with the African Lakes Company, to establish steam locomotion on the Zambesi and the Shiré, and that we intend to establish a monthly postal service, as well as a service for passengers between the sea and the missionary stations, because we are convinced that it is one of the most effectual modes of checking the raids of the slave-dealers and the introduction into the country of undesirable and objectional commodities. We must all feel, however, that the efforts of individuals and of companies, and I may say even of the International Conference, must fall short of the full attainment of these objects unless they receive the sympathy of the public at large. I presume that is why this meeting has been convened to-day. We know that the sympathy of the City of London never fails a good cause, and by supporting this resolution the City of London will add one more to the many services it has rendered to the oppressed and the unfortunate.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE WELFARE OF THE AFRICAN RACES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'different countries. People feel jealous of being advised by foreigners; they feel that there is an assumption of superiority of wisdom and virtue; and selfish motives are attributed to the advisers. Now, I venture to think that this objection does not apply in the slightest degree to the meeting to-day. Some eighteen months ago her Majesty\'s Government made a proposal, not that we should go and teach other countries what was to be done about the slave trade, but assuming that all European nations are now inclined to carry out principles which have been proclaimed both by treaty and international communications for some seventy-five years. As against the slave trade, the Government felt that the moment had come when other countries desired to give practical effect to that policy. Lord Salisbury selected perhaps the individual who was best qualified for the duty to preside over the Conference of European Powers. I therefore accepted the invitation to come here with very great pleasure. I received a little shock when I saw in the newspapers that objections were made to our meeting by a society for which I have the very greatest possible respect—that important historical society, the Anti-Slavery Society. It is now more than fifty years ago, very soon after the Aborigines\' Protection Society was established, that I entered office under Lord Palmerston. The strongest political feeling Lord Palmerston had was his horror of the slave trade, and his determination to put it down, and no one who was not in the Foreign Office at the time with him could hardly be aware of the immense amount of energy and labour he devoted to the attainment of that object. Under these circumstances I was naturally in communication with the Anti-Slavery Society—and I have at times been in communication with it ever since. I say that any objection from the Anti-Slavery Society, or any communication from it, would come with great authority. I own that if the objection taken had been that our objects were unworthy, I should have been very much shaken. But it is not so; they agree with us entirely in thinking that this question of the supply of arms to the slave-traders and the question of the supply of alcohol to a great multitude of the African population is one of the most serious and dangerous importance. Their objection rests on a question of tactics. They think that there are two questions already brought before the Conference of vital importance, and that they might be endangered by any other question being raised there at all. But on this question I am not sure that the Anti-Slavery Society speak with greater authority than any other body of men. What is our position here? You have heard the first resolution. Other resolutions to be proposed will set out the prominent causes of the mischief, and the final resolution will be ""That copies of the foregoing resolutions be forwarded to his Majesty the King of the Belgians, the president of the International Conference, her Majesty\'s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and her Majesty\'s Minister at the Belgian Court."" There is nothing compulsory in that, and if Lord Salisbury and the King of the Belgians and Lord Vivian are of opinion that no new subject should be brought before the Conference, supposing they think it better to keep these resolutions a little in the background, in what way can our recommendations of today interfere with such a decision? If, they think that these subjects are so closely interweaved that they would not interfere with the general consent of the European Powers. I venture to think that it would strengthen the hands of Lord Salisbury and Lord Vivian, that a meeting under the presidency of the Lord Mayor had passed these resolutions. I said that it was a wise step to ask the King of the Belgians to take the initiative in this matter of the Conference. I think that it is impossible not to recognise why he has the greatest claims and qualifications for the task. In recent years we have seen men of great wealth making magnificent contributions to objects of philanthropy. The King of the Belgians has this pleasant characteristic, but none of the contributions approached in wideness of scope those of the King of the Belgians. We see what he has done, for instance, by the creation of the Congo State. He has not only given time and most anxious care to the affairs of the State—his contributions in a pecuniary sense are perfectly enormous. The official returns show the cost to be about £70,000 a year, and the whole comes from the King of the Belgians, not as Sovereign, but as a private individual from his private means. I have reason to believe that hundreds of thousands beyond that have been spent by him in this great work, and I think it is satisfactory that the King of the Belgians accepted the presidency of the Conference, the object of which is to give practical effect to principles which have really been sanctioned by the whole of Europe for some seventy-five years. I think it is becoming that this meeting we should commence operations by giving a vote of thanks to the King of the Belgians for the part he has taken in this important affair.

Those expectations were formed on the supposition that he might possess some few grains of common sense, which would place vividly before his mental vision the dangers of collision between an earthen pot and a sledge hammer wielded by an arm of power. It seems to be now past dispute that, instead of disowning the acts of the brutal authorities at Whydah, who showed themselves to be fit servants to such a master, he has put a bold front on the matter, and sent the insolent message that ""he will pay the Commodore in powder and bullets if he will come up to Abomey."" This is the language that might be expected only from a doomed idiot, vapouring among the spiritless slaves by whom he may be surrounded, and who have worshipped him as almost a god, until he believes himself to be quite one. It is clearly full time that both King and people should be undeceived by coming in rude contact with something more than a few European trading clerks and agents, who, naturally enough, in the interests of their trade, submit, uncomplainingly, to everything short of actual plunder and brutal violence. Our opinions and feelings respecting the frantic iniquity of Dahomey are so strong, and our conviction that it is the imperative duty of Great Britain, as the real protecting Power on the West Coast of Africa, to put a final end to its enormities as being a daily insult to humanity, is so unalterable, that all we can say in reply to the braggart King is that we hope he will continue in his present frame of mind, and not be moved to feigned repentance by the blockade of his sea-ports. We do not wish him to repent, and thus save himself and his authority from destruction—unless his repentance should go so far (which it never would do) as to secure his faithful acquiescence in British demands, that he should never henceforth make any inroads into Egba territories in search of victims for his atrocious festivals, and that those festivals of blood should be entirely put an end to. The earth has groaned long enough under this blood-thirsty monster, and the devilish system that he at this time represents. That system is incurable by any other means than the entire destruction of the Power with which it is identified, and of which it is an inseparable part. The late King, and the present also, more than once declared to Europeans who have been on missions to Abomey, that even were he desirous of doing so, he could not discontinue that perpetual series of human sacrifices in which his people delight; that his prestige would be gone, and that he in his turn would be a victim if he ceased to justify by deeds his title of ""Man-slayer."" There is possibly truth in this. The people, like their King, are accustomed to sniff the, to them, intoxicating odour of the reeking blood of victims slaughtered before their eyes, and would object to be deprived of a gratification they have so long enjoyed. Under such circumstances there is only one way of purifying the horribly polluted atmosphere of Dahomey, and that is by bringing a superior force to bear upon King, people, and institutions. As already stated, we have ourselves always held the opinion that it was the duty of a civilized Christian Power such as Great Britain to interfere in the interests of humanity. There are now other interests, in addition to those of mere humanity, urging and impelling to the work. Not only has one of her subjects been grievously maltreated, but the financial interests of the Gold Coast Colony are very prejudicially interfered with by the action of Dahomey as a marauding State.

These treaties took two forms - those between Africans and Europeans, and bilateral agreements between the Europeans themselves. The African-European treaties were basically of two kinds. Firstly, there were the slave trade and the commercial treaties; these had generated friction, which in turn led to European political interference in African affairs. Secondly, there were the political treaties by which African rulers either purportedly surrendered sovereignty in return for protection, or undertook not to enter into treaty obligations with other European nations.\nThese political treaties were in vogue during our period. They were made either by representatives of European governments or by those of private organizations who later transferred them to their respective govern› ments. If a metropolitan government accepted them, the territories in question were usually annexed or declared a protectorate; if, on the other hand, it suspected their authenticity, or if it felt constrained by the vicissi› tudes of Weltpolitik to exercise caution, these treaties were used for bargaining purposes during the bilateral European negotiations. Africans, on the other hand, entered into these arrangements for a variety of motives, but particularly because of the interests of their people. In some cases, they desired treaty relations with Europeans because they hoped that the prestige of such a relationship would endow them with certain political advantages in dealing with their neighbours. Sometimes a weak African state would desire a treaty with a European power in the hope of using it to renounce allegiance to another African state that claimed sovereignty over it. An African sovereign would also desire a treaty in the hope of using it to keep recalcitrant subject states in line. And sometimes a treaty with one European nation was seen by some African states as a means of preserving their independence which was being threatened by other European nations.$^{42}$ Whatever was the case, the African-European political treaties played an important role in the final partition of Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': ""Because the lands and peoples were so interwoven, developments in one part always had effects and implications in other parts. European abolitionists found, for example, that to stop the slave trade and the wars in the interior, they had to reckon not just with the coastal rulers but also with the different power bases in the interior. Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome. Similarly, British peace› makers involved in resolving aspects of nineteenth-century Yoruba warfare had to travel virtually throughout the length and breadth of the culture area.\nUnfortunately, the European approach was divisive, tending towards politically structured differentiation. This was already noticeable in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era. British interests came to be specifically protected visà-vis the interest of other European nationals; British interests were also advanced against those of Africans. We have already drawn attention to the penetration of the Benin kingdom from the Niger delta and the resultant whittling down of Benin's trading hinterland to the extent of the eventual abandonment of Ughoton, Benin's traditional port.

This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.\nIn the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium. Major Christian missionary bodies such as the Church Missionary Society (CMS) of the Church of England and the Lyons-based SociØtØ des Missions Africaines (SMA) of the Roman Catholic Church each employed a mix of European nationals. Father Boghero, who led the SMA in an effort to re› introduce Roman Catholic Christianity to West Africa in the nineteenth century, was an Italian. The pioneer SMA Fathers in most parts of the area which became Nigeria were French, just as it was such British missionaries as Thomas Birch Freeman of the Methodists and Samuel Ajayi Crowther of the CMS who pioneered the work of Christian missions in what was to become French Dahomey (present-day People's Republic of Benin).$^{33}$ British, French, German and Portuguese traders set up businesses adjacent to one another and, as the case of Badagry clearly demonstrated, there were residential quarters for diverse European nationals in the major ports all along the coast of the Bight of Benin.\nTraders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.\nThis flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours. This route also linked Yorubaland with Borgu, Hausaland, Borno and beyond. The Christian missionary journeys across the wide expanse of Yorubaland from north to south and east to west and between Yorubaland and Dahomey were made possible because the necess› ary interconnecting routes already existed.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""Indeed, the Dahomey authorities could not appreciate the demand which several British and French abolitionist delegations made on them to stop the trade, given the willingness of the Brazil-based Portuguese dealers to continue transacting the business in Dahomey ports.\nNevertheless, Dahomey realized that changes were taking place. Its adjustment to changing times was noticeable from the mid-century when, under the influence of a French trading firm, Victor RØgis, King Gezo (c. 1818-58) of Dahomey was persuaded to intensify the trade in palm oil, first as a supplement to the export of slaves and eventually as the dominant factor in the state's export economy.$^{41}$ The transition from slave to 'legi› timate' trade meant a corresponding increase in the need to retain war captives as labour for the maintenance and expansion of the palm oil industry. Slaves also came to be used more for transporting goods from the interior to the coast and vice-versa than as commodities for export. By the time of the French conquest of 1892-4, the foundation of Dahomey's new economy - the monoculture of palm produce - had already been laid. Developments in Dahomey mirrored those in other parts of the MonoNiger region where, as in Yorubaland, war captives who otherwise would have been sold for export overseas came to be used extensively as labour on farm plantations, or for transporting trade goods to and from the coast."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The new changes resulted from a combination of factors, including the nineteenth-century wars which, as in Yorubaland, had the effect of ren› dering the coastal areas relatively safe and attractive to migration from the hinterlands in which most of the fighting took place; the sea-borne trade which was rendered permanent by the transition from slave to 'legitimate' trade, thereby conferring a definite economic advantage on the coastal regions; and the steady growth of European interest, which enlarged the traditional role of selected coastal towns such as Lagos, Porto Novo and eventually Cotonou to take on new and increasing responsibilities not only as ports but also as political capitals of emergent colonial states and their independent African successors.\nIn all these changes, however, the economic factor would appear to have been the most dominant, especially with reference to the European presence. Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

The European anti-slave trade movement hit the state's economy, based as it was almost solely on the slave trade. However, Gezo's economic policy was to continue to respond to the demand for slaves from Portuguese dealers while at the same time responding to the stimulus of the export trade in palm oil as the ultimate substitute for slave exports.$^{22}$ These signs of the relative political and economic strength of Dahomey were becoming visible at the same time as symptoms of advanced decline were becoming increasingly apparent in Old Qyo.

If the two went hand to hand for Dahomey and Oyo, in Benin we had the formation of a strong state without such participation, and the inverse was true for the Niger delta. 36 The point, however, is a different one. It is that involvement in the world-economy required political structures that ensured the functioning of the economy; its commerce, its production, its labour-force supply.\nThe outside pressure was to have such structures.$^{37}$ Where the existing structures performed the necessary functions, for whatever reason, there was little pressure to change them. But, of course, the involvement in the world-economy increased the economic importance to given internal producers of sympathetic political structures. It is the internal producers who pressed to change the structures.$^{38}$ This led to various kinds of turmoil, which were of limited benefit to other participants in the world-economy. The latter in turn pressed for political stabilization, which took the form of creating states which participated in and were therefore constrained by the interstate system.$^{39}$ Ultimately, as we know, this led in most of Africa to the creation of colonial states. The abolition of the slave trade was a crucial political and economic event in this process. As plantation slavery and the slave trade were phenomena deriving from the operation of the capitalist world-economy, so was the abolition of the slave trade and of plantation slavery. I do not wish here to re-open the question of the importance of the abolitionists as a pressure group in this process. They of course existed and were part of the process.

We therefore do not need to speculate about the possible contribution to that complex of forces and ideas of European mercantilist influence in the days of the slave trade or capitalist influence in the days of abolition and journeys of discovery. The initiative for the djihäd movements came from within. The djihäd states took a great interest in promoting agriculture, partly through traditional household production, partly also through estates worked by slave or client labour. They also promoted industrial manufacture and trade. They improved trade routes and offered protection to traders and merchants. By far the greatest portion of the traffic on the routes was for local and regional exchange.

They also supplied, in the form of tribute, a large part of the manpower used in Asante wars and agriculture.$^{13}$ This significant distinction has been contested on the grounds that economic and political motivations existed in all the Asante wars. In a similar vein, references have been made to the presence of Asante representatives in all types of states and also to the introduction of substantial Asante features into the Dagomba army or interventions by the Asantehene in Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes. 14 It is obvious nevertheless that the mandates of the Asante regional commissioners varied according to the situation. In the Akan regions they had to ensure that disputes were settled by enforcing observance of the Asantehene's oath so as to emphasize his sovereignty over these territories. The collection of taxes in these regions, seen by contemporary European ii. Cf. R.S. Rattray, 1929, pp. 398-409; K.A. Busia, 1951; I. Wilks, 1975, ch. 2. observers as a form of exploitation, was no problem for the Asantehene, since Asante states themselves had to bear the same burdens.15 The real problem was territorial sovereignty. In non-Akan regions, the com¬ missioners strove to strengthen the terms of the 'treaty' between the Asantehene and the Dagomba, for example,16 concerning the tribute. On the other hand, we have no evidence confirming the presence of Gonja or Dagomba contingents in the Asante army or of payment by these countries of the Asante war tax (apeatoo). The settlement of the Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes must therefore be considered as a political act with economic motives: peace in these territories guaranteed payment of the tribute, as well as the introduction of Asante institutions into the Dagomba army.

In some cases the dominant class emerged stronger as a result of economic and military ties to the slave-traders. Consider relations between the Bemba rulers and the Arab and Swahili traders. Under the leadership of Chileshe Chipela the Bemba had just completed a phase of territorial expansion and political centralization when the foreign traders entered their homeland around i860. As a result, the Bemba kingdom was far more unified and powerful than most states in the region. The geographical position of the Bemba, somewhat removed from the principal trade routes, precluded the growth of a large and potentially seditious merchant community within the core of their kingdom. Equally important, there was no incentive for the Arab and Swahili traders to adopt a hostile posture since the Bemba were not economic rivals. Most of the royal families' wealth came from raiding and tribute in the form of ivory and slaves and they were happy to exchange them for the cloth and other imported goods provided by the coastal merchants. This economic complementarity fostered a harmonious relationship and simultaneously enhanced the internal position of the Bemba aristocracy, which used the foreign commodities to recruit new followers and strengthen their links to subordinate chiefs. The continued demand for captives and ivory also fuelled a new expansionist phase from i860 to 1880, during which Bemba forces conquered most of contemporary north-eastern Zambia. Thus, through ties to foreign merchants, the Bemba rulers gained unprecedented regional power while accumulating a substantial amount of wealth. 43 As in the case of the Bemba, other local chiefs and merchants entered into alliances with the slave-traders that proved extremely beneficial. Throughout the 1870s the Chewa chief, Mwase Kasungu, whose territory straddled the Lake Malawi-Katanga trade route, provided food for the Arab caravans in exchange for guns. These weapons enabled him to withstand the subsequent Mbwela Nguni invasions.$^{44}$ Economic con› siderations also motivated Arab and Swahili protection of the Senga chiefs, who were important suppliers of ivory.$^{45}$ Similar factors help explain Chikunda alliances with the Ambo against the Bemba, and assistance that they provided the Nsenga against the Soli, which occurred in the decade preceding the 'Scramble'.$^{46}$ In all these cases, it is clear that the aliens' strategy was to prevent"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.637, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': 'European aggression on Liberian and Ethiopian territory, 1880-1914', 'content': 'Both Liberia and Ethiopia had enjoyed more or less amicable relations with the European powers up to 1879.

Precisely because the Maghrib served as the transit and transfer nexus of what was in effect an indirect long-distance trade between the Sahelian zones and Europe, there was less pressure on it to create new loci of export-oriented production on its own territory. There are conflicting views on the degree to which the trans-Saharan trade continued to be important in the period 1750-1880.$^{12}$ It is clear, however, that late nine› teenth-century colonization eliminated the economic significance of these ancient trade routes, and simultaneously therefore withdrew the 'protective cover' for the Maghrib of its entrepôt role.\nThe rise of so-called legitimate trade in West Africa in the nineteenth century has been a central theme of historiography for some time now. What was important was not, however, the increase in the quantity of trade or even its changing content in terms of the items traded, but the transformation of productive structures that followed therefrom and the political consequences of such changes in the relations of production. This was a process that started before the British efforts to abolish the slave trade, since these efforts were themselves a parallel outcome of the expansion of the capitalist world-economy; to be sure the transformation of productive structures in West Africa was accelerated by abolition. 13 The 'classic' and in some ways the most successful of the new products, now amply documented, was that of palm oil in the Niger delta area.

It seemed to us so advisable in the interests of African civilisation that he should be not only allowed, but encouraged and assisted to do so, that we have strenuously advocated the measure. In our May number we made some comments on a letter of the late Commodore on the West Coast station; in which, in pursuance, as we believed of orders from home, the King of Dahomey\'s request was refused. Our correspondence from Dahomey shows us, however, that the King has not accepted this reply of the Commodore as a final decision against him, but has applied directly by letter to Her Majesty\'s Government with the same object. In the article in our May number before alluded to we exposed the error and inconsistency of such a refusal as had been given to the King, and endeavoured once again to show how much that change which we so desire for Dahomey and Ashantee might possibly be forwarded by bringing some of the chief men of those countries into immediate personal contact with our advanced civilisation and all the humane institutions to which the blessed precepts of the Gospel of Peace have given rise among us. There is nothing more necessary to be shown to the authorities of those barbarous countries than the value which we attach to human life; and that although unhappily wars have not ceased among so-called Christian nations, human life is, except upon the battle-field, regarded as a sacred thing, in no case to be wantonly taken away, and in all cases to be hedged round by the supreme authority with all possible protections. We do not know what may be the decision of our Government, and what answer may be sent to the King of Dahomey. We have reason, however, to believe that the arguments put forward by us have not been without effect in modifying opinions in quarters where opposition to the King of Dahomey\'s wishes was known to exist. There is consequently reason to hope that a favourable answer may be accorded, at least to the extent of meeting the King\'s wishes that some of his chiefs should come over to this country, by offering those facilities without which it would be difficult, if not impossible, for them to do so. This, and a formal reception of such envoys by Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, are two very different things. If the latter could by any possibility be construed into an approval of, or even into a cessation of protest against, those horrible barbarities by which Dahomey is polluted, especially in those superstitious ""Customs"" in which human life is so wantonly destroyed, we should say at once that such envoys should not be admitted, either formally or informally, to the Royal presence; but if, as we think there is reason to believe, the personal displeasure of our Sovereign at such atrocities, pronounced by herself in presence of those envoys, might have the effect of inducing the King to put an end at once and for ever to his slave wars and to those appalling ""Customs"" for which Dahomey has become so infamously distinguished, we do venture to express the hope that in the event of the envoys arriving here, some means may be devised by which they may thus become assured of Her Majesty\'s abhorrence of things in which the Kings of Dahomey have delighted, and that Her Majesty considers those things in which they have gloried as incompatible with the existence of any friendly understanding, or interchange of courtesies between herself and him. We do think that some means may be devised by which such a Royal Christian effort might be made in the cause of humanity and of Christian civilisation in Africa without any sacrifice of Royal dignity. The end in view is really a great one. The cessation of slave-hunting wars and of ""Customs"" in Dahomey, and the entry of that country, however feeble at first its steps may be, into the ranks of the world\'s advancing Christian civilisation, would have a great effect on the surrounding countries. A new way would be opened through Dahomey into the interior of Africa. And as the Dahoman Government has long since shown itself alive to the importance of good roads between its principal places, more might possibly be done within a short time in that than in any other native African country in establishing improved communications between the coast and the interior. The visit of the Dahoman envoys to this country, and their judicious reception and entertainment here, are therefore much to be desired. It would be absurd, of course, to bring them over at this time of the year, when they would be exposed to the rigours of winter; but we hope that such an answer may be given to the King\'s application, and such instructions be issued and arrangements made, as may lead to the presence of those men among us some time in the months of May or June of next year.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-09-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_09_1866#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.608, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Hope in Dahomey', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'she has been so richly endowed by nature. In this number of our journal we have also to record the painful news of an active foreign slave-trade at Whydah—of the shipment of nearly 1,000 poor wretches in one steamer, destined for the disgusting shambles of the modern plantations of Cuba, there to be used up in eight or ten years in the production of sugar for the British market. We cannot forget that, on those 1,000 slaves alone, the King obtains a fancied profit of some 10,000l., which we enable the Cuban planters to send him, through the slave-traders, for the supply of the raw material out of which they manufacture sugar for us. We are compelled to bear in mind that at the rate of duty he levies on palm oil shipped at Whydah—viz., one dollar per puncheon—there must be a very large exportation of produce to compensate him for relinquishing the slave-trade. We have also recently obtained a new insight into the dreadful ""Customs"" of Dahomey—of the supposed obligation on the part of the monarch to continue them during his life; and Aboekuta, though a hard nut, perhaps, to crack, has in its numerous population a delicious kernel for the wholesale butcher and slave-dealer. Nevertheless, we hail with joy this manifestation on the part of the King of a desire to enter into some amicable relations with the Christian civilization of this country. And we do indeed earnestly hope that advantage will be taken of it by Her Majesty\'s Government. We stated in our last that Commodore A. Eardley Wilmott had been furnished by them with the presents that would be requisite should he attempt a visit to Abomey. And we know his earnest desire to detach the King of Dahomey from the slave-trade. We have, therefore, reason to believe that when he receives, by the mail which leaves Liverpool to-morrow, this interesting intelligence, which has been communicated through us, he will lose no time but proceed to Whydah as soon as his other duties will permit. The King asks for the light to be brought to him; and such a desire ought to be immediately gratified. It may be only curiosity on his part, or a desire for the presents which he well knows he will receive; or to raise himself still higher in the opinion of his people, through that acknowledgment of him as king by this great nation; or it may be only a ruse on his part, to lull the Aboekutans into a fancied security, so that they may become an easier prey. Still, his desire ought to be complied with; the wishes, and, if necessary, the demands, of this Christian country ought to be diplomatically placed before him. The person whom he has named as interpreter should accompany the British negotiator. And then, should all fail—should no good result be obtained—we shall have at least the satisfaction that we performed our duty. We are not sanguine of any immediate good result, because we have no reason to believe that the negotiator has any power to promise a subsidy on the part of this country, which might compensate (until legitimate commerce should be largely developed) for the fancied pecuniary loss the King would sustain by the abandonment of the slave-trade. But we might expect to learn the amount of subsidy that would induce such abandonment; and it would then be for this country to determine whether it would be our duty or our interest to pay the price.', 'last_edit_date': '1862-12-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1862#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.613, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'advantageous.

On the Dahomey coast a French firm of old standing flourishes, of a kind which would gain rather than lose by the intervention of the arms of the Republic in Dahomey. The suggestion from Paris is that the house could not object to a course likely to issue in the extension of French rule, or a French protectorate, to Abomey and Whydah.

Some anti-slavery journals appear to deprecate the use of force towards that monarch. They think that persuasion and entreaty should be brought to bear on him, with a view to induce him to desist from his practices of sacrificing human beings and engaging in slave-hunts. Persuasion, argument, and entreaty, have been repeatedly used on this present King of Dahomey and his predecessors, and used in vain. These kings tell us that it is the custom of their nation to hunt for slaves and to sacrifice human beings. He who is king is obliged to do these things. It is with him just as much a duty as the abiding by the advice of responsible ministers is with the Sovereign of Great Britain. If he abstained from these practices, his subjects would turn him out, and set up another man in his place, who would carry them out in accordance with immemorial usage. In order to put down these barbarous practices, only one course will avail—to use physical force. The British Government must say to the Dahomians, \'Sir, you are unwholesome in your habits and troublesome in your ways and practices. You won\'t live and let live.

About fifty years ago it occurred to a dealer of Marseilles to send to this coast a quantity of cotton goods and articles of coloured glass, which were exchanged for products of the country. The undertaking proved successful, and soon this dealer, whose name was Regis, erected a factory, where trade was regularly carried on. He found that the King of Dahomey employed the shells known as cowries as money. He kept a large store of them in a deep pit, which he used as his treasury. M. Regis accordingly collected cowries from the east coast, which he conveyed to Dahomey, where he used them as money in making his purchases. By dint of his cowries, M. Regis in a short time was able to establish several factories, and other Marseilles houses followed his example. M. Regis died, having amassed a fortune, and the business is now carried on by two nephews of his. The late King, Gelele, who is only just dead, was partly educated in France by the advice and under the care of the Regis firm, and at sixteen years of age he was ordered home by his father, and was taken back to Dahomey.

Though rather startling in its conclusions, it seems to bear the stamp of genuineness; and is interesting, as affording a possible explanation to other mysterious embroilments than this particular instance. The French nation has not shown much interest in this war: which has not even provoked enough criticism to be made a weapon of party controversy. They seem generally to have found no less difficulty in understanding its use or reason than the King of Dahomey himself whose request to President Carnot for enlightenment was published some weeks ago. And the French Ministry knows little more about it than the rest of the world. The popular belief has been that the Admiral on the West African station, and the military forces employed in garrison duty in the same district have tried to diversify their monotony by picking a quarrel. The account now published, if true, relieves them of the burden of such a reproach. Neither officers nor men have any inclination to force their country into speculative enterprises in such a region as the Slave Coast. Personally they are not likely to win glory thereby; and for the State the consequences of such a contest are both painful and unprofitable. For the ascertainment of the source of this inglorious business attention must be directed to a very different quarter. Arms and commerce are proverbially at strife. Everyone sympathises with the trader's complaint of the confusion which warfare introduces into his affairs. He is the natural advocate and friend of peace, at least when his relations are with communities as advanced and well-regulated as his own. War in civilised and fairly developed regions is a terrible disturber of trade. But its consequences are not so ruinous where these conditions do not exist.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

Those expectations were formed on the supposition that he might possess some few grains of common sense, which would place vividly before his mental vision the dangers of collision between an earthen pot and a sledge hammer wielded by an arm of power. It seems to be now past dispute that, instead of disowning the acts of the brutal authorities at Whydah, who showed themselves to be fit servants to such a master, he has put a bold front on the matter, and sent the insolent message that ""he will pay the Commodore in powder and bullets if he will come up to Abomey."" This is the language that might be expected only from a doomed idiot, vapouring among the spiritless slaves by whom he may be surrounded, and who have worshipped him as almost a god, until he believes himself to be quite one. It is clearly full time that both King and people should be undeceived by coming in rude contact with something more than a few European trading clerks and agents, who, naturally enough, in the interests of their trade, submit, uncomplainingly, to everything short of actual plunder and brutal violence. Our opinions and feelings respecting the frantic iniquity of Dahomey are so strong, and our conviction that it is the imperative duty of Great Britain, as the real protecting Power on the West Coast of Africa, to put a final end to its enormities as being a daily insult to humanity, is so unalterable, that all we can say in reply to the braggart King is that we hope he will continue in his present frame of mind, and not be moved to feigned repentance by the blockade of his sea-ports. We do not wish him to repent, and thus save himself and his authority from destruction—unless his repentance should go so far (which it never would do) as to secure his faithful acquiescence in British demands, that he should never henceforth make any inroads into Egba territories in search of victims for his atrocious festivals, and that those festivals of blood should be entirely put an end to. The earth has groaned long enough under this blood-thirsty monster, and the devilish system that he at this time represents. That system is incurable by any other means than the entire destruction of the Power with which it is identified, and of which it is an inseparable part. The late King, and the present also, more than once declared to Europeans who have been on missions to Abomey, that even were he desirous of doing so, he could not discontinue that perpetual series of human sacrifices in which his people delight; that his prestige would be gone, and that he in his turn would be a victim if he ceased to justify by deeds his title of ""Man-slayer."" There is possibly truth in this. The people, like their King, are accustomed to sniff the, to them, intoxicating odour of the reeking blood of victims slaughtered before their eyes, and would object to be deprived of a gratification they have so long enjoyed. Under such circumstances there is only one way of purifying the horribly polluted atmosphere of Dahomey, and that is by bringing a superior force to bear upon King, people, and institutions. As already stated, we have ourselves always held the opinion that it was the duty of a civilized Christian Power such as Great Britain to interfere in the interests of humanity. There are now other interests, in addition to those of mere humanity, urging and impelling to the work. Not only has one of her subjects been grievously maltreated, but the financial interests of the Gold Coast Colony are very prejudicially interfered with by the action of Dahomey as a marauding State. The yearly armed expeditions into the Egba territories, even up to the immediate neighbourhood of Abeokuta, in quest of plunder and victims for sacrifice in the ""Customs,"" inflict very great injury not only on the industrious Egba agriculturists, but also, as a necessary result, on the revenues of Lagos. There is an annual scare in the Egba territories. Farms are deserted, the people take refuge in Abeokuta, and their property is wasted and destroyed. We feel sure that we do not exaggerate when we say that were those marauding inroads to cease, and to cease at the absurd certainty that there will not be any renewal of them, agricultural industry will take so great a development in the Egba countries that the production would be doubled, with corresponding advantage to the', 'last_edit_date': '1876-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1876#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.611, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The New Route to Abomey, the Capital of Dahomey', 'section_title': '', 'content': '## THE SLAVE-TRADE IN LAGOS.', 'last_edit_date': '1877-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1877#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH TRADE WITH WESTERN AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '**BRITISH TRADE WITH WESTERN AFRICA.**\n\n**Mr. Alvan Millson**, Assistant Colonial Secretary for the Colony of Lagos, delivered an address recently before the members of the African Trade Section of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce on the subject of Yorubaland.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1891#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.612, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Friend to the King of Dahomey', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I cannot close this letter without mentioning at least one circumstance regarding the late King of Dahomey, which was related to me on two different occasions by two trustworthy individuals who had visited Dahomey half-a-dozen times, and were great allies with the King.

The King of Dahomey, on a certain occasion, expressed a curiosity to ascertain the exact appearance presented by an infant whilst in the womb, and in order to gratify that diabolical curiosity, this religious monarch ordered one of his female subjects who was in an advanced state of pregnancy to be brought before him. I cannot write what followed, as it would be too disgusting; but suffice it to say, that the King, having satisfied his curiosity, exclaimed, ""Is that all?"" There are those still living that can corroborate this. Now, I should say that one whose religion would not deter him from committing a crime which I believe to be unparalleled would not hesitate to order the slaughter of any number of his helpless dependents.

324,"The establishment of a British Consulate at Rabba on the Niger River was strategically aimed at securing and regulating trade, protecting commercial interests, and fostering peaceful relations with African communities.","The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of British strategic interests in Africa, particularly regarding the establishment of a British Consulate at Rabba on the Niger River. While the General History of Africa does not specifically mention Rabba, it offers context on British efforts to secure and regulate trade, protect commercial interests, and foster relations with African communities through treaties, consulates, and naval presence in regions like the Bights of Benin and Bonny. These activities reflect broader strategic goals, such as negotiating favorable conditions for British traders and diminishing local rulers' sovereignty. In contrast, The African Times articles directly support the claim by detailing the strategic importance of a Consulate at Rabba. They emphasize the Niger River's potential as a trade hub, particularly for cotton, and the necessity of British protection to secure this trade. The articles highlight the Consul's role in preventing European monopolization, addressing trader-native conflicts, promoting peace, and fostering civilization and Christianity. They also acknowledge challenges, such as native resistance and the need for British protection, adding complexity to the claim. Together, these sources illustrate the strategic aims of securing trade, protecting interests, and fostering peaceful relations, with The African Times providing specific evidence for Rabba that the General History of Africa lacks.","The paragraphs from the General History of Africa textbook do not specifically mention the establishment of a British Consulate at Rabba on the Niger River.

The text highlights British efforts to establish treaties, consulates, and naval presence in various regions, such as the Bights of Benin and Bonny, to protect and advance British trade interests. It also discusses the use of consuls and naval power to negotiate favorable conditions for British traders and the gradual erosion of local rulers' sovereignty. These activities align with the broader strategic goals mentioned in the claim, but there is no direct reference to Rabba or the Niger River specifically. This absence of information about Rabba is a notable difference, suggesting that while the British had similar strategic aims elsewhere, the textbook does not provide evidence of such actions at Rabba.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim regarding the strategic aim of establishing a British Consulate at Rabba on the Niger River. The articles emphasize the importance of the Niger River as a potential hub for trade, particularly in cotton, and the need for British protection to facilitate and secure this trade. The call for a Consul at Rabba is linked to the desire to create a large trade, protect traders, and ensure the development of the Niger's resources. The articles also highlight the need for British intervention to prevent other European powers, such as France, from monopolizing trade in the region. Furthermore, the presence of a Consul is seen as a means to address conflicts between traders and natives, promote peace, and foster civilization and Christianity. These points align with the claim that the establishment of a Consulate was aimed at securing and regulating trade, protecting commercial interests, and fostering peaceful relations with African communities. However, the articles also mention the challenges and risks involved, such as the native appetite for plunder and the need for British protection, which adds complexity to the claim.

European abolitionists found, for example, that to stop the slave trade and the wars in the interior, they had to reckon not just with the coastal rulers but also with the different power bases in the interior. Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome. Similarly, British peace› makers involved in resolving aspects of nineteenth-century Yoruba warfare had to travel virtually throughout the length and breadth of the culture area.\nUnfortunately, the European approach was divisive, tending towards politically structured differentiation. This was already noticeable in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era. British interests came to be specifically protected visà-vis the interest of other European nationals; British interests were also advanced against those of Africans. We have already drawn attention to the penetration of the Benin kingdom from the Niger delta and the resultant whittling down of Benin's trading hinterland to the extent of the eventual abandonment of Ughoton, Benin's traditional port.

Moreover, all of them were insisting on their sovereign rights to regulate trade and to levy duties on British traders. This, the new British consuls, such as Hewett and Johnston, would not tolerate. A typical example of the rulers who stood up to the British consuls and missionaries was Jaja of Opobo (see Plate 6.3). He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order. When Jaja still refused to comply in spite of Johnston's threats to bombard his town with British gunboats, Johnston enticed Jaja on board a ship in 1887 under a promise of safeconduct but arrested him and sent him to Accra$^{49}$ where he was tried and deported to the West Indies.

Many decades of British efforts to discover the course and sources of the Niger river were crowned with success when Richard and John Lander were brought from Aboh to Nembe (Brass) by its ruler, King Boy Amain, in 1830. Once the estuaries of the many rivers of the Niger delta were shown to be the entrance to the great Niger river, British interest was greatly increased in the area as a highway into the rich interior of Nigeria and West Africa. British traders, such as Macgregor Laird, as well as humanitarians and missionaries tried to move up the delta into the hinterland between the 1830s and 1850s.\nIn the eastern delta itself, the Church Missionary Society under the leadership of the Nigerian ex-slave, Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther, estab› lished missions at Bonny in 1864, at Twon-Brass in the Nembe kingdom in 1868, at Elem Kalahari (New Calabar in the documents) in 1874, and at Okrika in 1880.

Encouraged by Porto Novo itself, a French protectorate was declared over this coastal Aja state in 1863 to check further British advance along the coast to the west. Both the British and the French soon discovered the obvious: that the real value of Lagos or Porto Novo was to be measured in terms of the trade with the hinterland in the Yoruba and Aja interior which the two ports shared. This involvement of both Britain and France in the trade and politics of Lagos and Porto Novo respectively sparked off a spell of dramatic rivalry between the two powers in a bid to control Yorubaland, especially the western parts, and the adjacent Aja-speaking communities. In this Anglo-French rivalry, western Yorubaland became the main theatre because of the positive response of the local peoples, who saw in the European interventions the solution to the problem of the continuous invasion of their area by their more powerful neighbours.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.\nThis flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement.

Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated.

Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu.

Although it gave poor returns, trade other than in slaves developed in parallel and not in competition with the slave trade. The competition was between the Western nations, and they eventually arrived at an informal apportionment of spheres of economic interest to which African rulers did not object. France was predominant north of Sierra Leone and at some points on the Ivory Coast and in Gabon, where she set up Libreville in imitation of Freetown. 43 Americans and Europeans came to the coast and were tolerated in what was in effect a British economic enclave.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

France imported an average of 4000 tonnes a year between 1847 and 1856 and 2000 tons in the following decade. She compensated by importing an average of 8000 tonnes of groundnuts a year from Senegal and the Gambia plus 25 000 tonnes of 'tulucoona' nuts for the manufacture of household soap; these imports were worth 35 million gold francs in 1870.

It remained to develop production on an industrial scale; and this took no longer than it had taken the Cuban and Brazilian plantations to reach full production of sugar and coffee. The main producing areas corresponded to the best slave-exporting areas, from Dahomey$^{44}$ to the rivers of the Niger delta and Cameroon.

This admittedly meant that production was by means of a form of slavery, but within an African social and economic context.

A more extensive system of barter began to radiate into the interior.

In consequence, as the caliphal economy became relatively more efficient and neighbouring peoples depended more heavily on caliphal trade and traders, economic policy was increasingly a more effective instrument of power than warfare.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Cameroon coast and its hinterland 14', 'content': ""The commercial unity of the Cameroon-Bimbia-Rio del Rey region was further enhanced by the links established by each of the sub-sections of the region with the Bamenda grasslands in the interior.$^{20}$ Thus, many of the slaves reaching the coast between 1820 and the 1840s came from the Bamenda 'grassfields' and reached Bimbia and the Cameroon river via the Rio del Rey region.

In the Cameroon river and Bimbia, as in Calabar and the Niger delta, slaves were used in producing palm oil and palm kernels and other commodities of legitimate commerce. At Bimbia and the Cameroon river, an important variation was the well-organized system by which Kings William and Bell hired out some of their slaves to the West African Company at Fernando Po. The system assumed the nature of indenture, and provided an additional source of wealth for both monarchs. But the system was open to abuses, and led to British parliamentary investigation.

In spite of the efforts of the abolitionist Consul Warrington, Britain was largely indifferent to the trade towards North Africa. In theory, all the participants in the trade, with the exception of Morocco, were under the control of the Turks of Constantinople. In practice, however, the provinces had long considered the suzerainty of the Kâramânlï to be of little conse› quence and tended to act independently. The French military conquest of the Regency of Algiers in 1830 turned into colonization from 1842 onwards, and the white settlers had little desire to employ slave labour. Caught between French and British pressures, the neighbouring Regency of Tunis abolished the trade between 1840 and 1842. Further east, the Regency of Tripoli had more obstacles to overcome because it had to obtain the consent of chieftains in the hinterland, some of whom were powerful middlemen in the trade in slaves from Borno or Sokoto. In 1842, Shaykh 'Abd alDjalil, who dominated the Fezzân from his stronghold at Murzuk, did agree to the abolition of the trade, but he was murdered. Turkey had re› established direct rule over Tripoli and Cyrenaica in 1835 and it was thenceforth clear that the effective abolition of the trade depended on the Turkish attitude towards it. The Sultan of Constantinople banned the trade in 1857, but it was not really interrupted anywhere, not even in Egypt, in spite of the growing Western influence. In 1870, the German traveller Georg Schweinfurth, who had arrived from 'the heart of Africa', wondered what kind of assistance abolition of the trade was likely to receive from the Khedive.$^{21}$ Morocco was a case apart. It was the only country in the Maghrib regarded by the Europeans as a power to be reckoned with, and diplomatic initiatives and humanitarian coaxings were unavailing there until 1887. At a time when the Atlantic slave trade was beginning to show signs of waning, the trans-Saharan trade could still rely on secure routes for the export and distribution of slaves. They ran, on one hand, to Morocco, which was importing from 3500 to 4000 black Africans a year in the middle of the nineteenth century and 500 a year as late as the"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Madagascar 1800-80', 'section_title': 'The great modernizer: King Radama I (1810-28)', 'content': ""goods. Moreover, Madagascar was important for political and strategic considerations. In particular, the British wanted to secure the support of the ruler for the abolition of the slave trade, since Madagascar was one of the main sources of slaves in the region. It was Sir Robert's desire, therefore, to pursue an active political role in Madagascar. This policy, coinciding as it did with Radama's own determination to expand to the east, was to have, as one writer has put it, 'important consequences for the future of Madagascar'. 12 After several friendly contacts, Farquhar sent a diplomatic mission, led by Captain Le Sage, which arrived in Antananarivo on 21 December 1816. A treaty of friendship and commerce was eventually signed on 4 February 1817 between Radama and Le Sage. But this treaty did not satisfy the Mauritian Governor because it did not mention the slave trade, a matter of considerable importance to Sir Robert. The Governor therefore sent another mission to Radama's capital, this time led by James Hastie, a former Sergeant at Arms in India and more experienced in handling negotiations with oriental rulers.$^{13}$ Hastie brought along with him a number of gifts for the king, including horses, a compass, a map of the world and a chiming clock, all of which greatly impressed the young king and helped Hastie to win his love and confidence. The negotiations, however, stumbled over the British insistence that Radama should outlaw the slave trade in Madagascar. When Radama argued that by doing this he would be com› mitting economic suicide because the slave trade was the major source of his revenue, Hastie had a ready answer: the British would pay the Malagasy ruler an annual sum of 1000 dollars in gold, 1000 dollars in silver, a hundred barrels of gunpowder, 100 English muskets with 100 flints, 400 soldiers' uniforms, 12 sergeants' swords, 600 pieces of cloth, a full-dress uniform for himself and 2 horses as compensation.$^{14}$ Radama considered that he had made a fair deal, especially since the treaty also recognized him as king of the whole of Madagascar. The Anglo-Malagasy Treaty of Friendship and Commerce was signed at Tamatave on 23 October 1817. James Hastie, the successful negotiator, was dispatched to Madagascar again in 1820 to act as the British Resident in the Malagasy capital."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 93, 'article_title': 'NOTICES', 'full_section_title': 'NOTICES', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1863#article-0', 'issue_date': '23_02_1863', 'content': ""MEMORIAL TO EARL RUSSELL FOR A CONSUL AT RABBA, ON THE RIVER NIGER.\n\nA memorial praying that a British Consul may be placed at Rabba, on the River Niger, has been adopted by the Council of the African-Aid Society.

The Niger and its great tributary, the Chadda, rival the Mississippi in everything but Anglo-Saxon enterprise. Cotton is indigenous; the natives, although undoubtedly they have much to learn even in this, know how to cultivate it. They have produced and sold it, as we showed last month, at about 23d. per pound for clean raw cotton of very good quality, far superior to Surats, and such as nearly every one of our Lancashire mills could work up. The cotton countries begin along the Delta, about 150 miles from the sea. Thence, for 800 miles on the two rivers, there is an open navigation, offering every requisite facility for the cheap transport of produce. The people are inclined to industry—they are beginning to thirst for English goods. And why are not these facilities, good dispositions, and desires made available for the future security of Lancashire? Why? Well, we state unhesitatingly—because the British Government has only done hitherto but a small part of its duty as regards the encouragement of navigation and trade in the Niger. At a period of profuse national expenditure, a few thousand pounds a-year are thought too much to risk for the future security of hundreds of thousands of cotton operatives. Relieved by the spontaneous individual charity of the people from the necessity of furnishing two or three millions sterling for the support of our unemployed countrymen, they content themselves with uttering a few formal phrases about future cotton supply, and leave this, like the feeding of starving men, women, and children, to the community at large to provide for. As a principle, the non-intervention of Government in commercial matters is good. Under ordinary circumstances, it works well too. But no rigid and unelastic system ever yet sufficed for great exceptional and extraordinary national emergencies. And in such an one we find ourselves at present. The Government prints from time to time some reports from it agents and others as regards fields for cotton supply, and there its solicitude for the future seems to end. Like the Lancashire manufacturers, it talks and prints, but does not act. It folds its arms as they do, and seems to wait as they do, in the hope that sooner or later the slave fields of the Southern American States will recommence furnishing a supply of cotton. Untaught by the past, both Government and manufacturers seem as if they would be quite content to depend, as heretofore, on the American Slave States for cotton. ""It is not the duty of a Government to get cotton,"" says a smiling Minister. ""It is no part of a manufacturer\'s duty to provide a supply of cotton,"" says the grumbling manufacturer. We admit this. But this is only half the truth. It is the duty of both, under present exceptional circumstances, to say to those whose ordinary business it would be to obtain a supply, ""We cannot expect you to take all the risk; we will give every possible facility—we will take our share in the venture."" What we ask at the present moment of the Government is little enough—we ask for a Consul at Rabba, on the Niger. It cannot be expected that those who are otherwise inclined to run the risks which necessarily attend the introduction of commerce into new regions, will go 500 miles up an African river for produce, however much the people of this country may want it, without some British protection there. We have heard it said that the duty of Government is to send a Consul where there is already a trade established. Ordinarily it may be so; but in this case we do not hesitate to say that it is their duty, knowing that a large trade could be created there, to send a Consul, in order that such a trade may be created. Strict maxims of political economy, and narrow views of official duty, will not feed a starving population, or revive and secure a languishing and precarious industry. There are especial reasons for Government action, as well as ordinary seasons of Government abstention. The present is one of the former. We can scarcely conceive that an enlightened Government should hesitate where the path of duty is so plain. We hope it will not hesitate. A small annual expenditure, in such a case as this, is true economy. We do not ask for a bounty on Niger cotton; we do not like a trade fostered and encouraged, pampered and misled, by a vicious aiding principle. But what we do ask, under the exceptional circumstances of cotton supply, is, that the Government will do all that may be necessary to induce our enterprising mercantile people to set about a development of the vast cotton and other resources of that great river of Central Africa, the Niger. And first among these is the appointment of a British Consul at Rabba.'}, {'id': 143, 'article_title': 'THE RIVER NIGER', 'full_section_title': 'THE RIVER NIGER', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1863#article-22', 'issue_date': '23_03_1863', 'content': ""There are abundant supplies of provisions.

The uncivilized natives of Africa, like all uncivilized people, look upon a wrecked ship and her cargo as their legitimate prey. Until we know, therefore, all the circumstances connected with this loss of the Sultan of Sockatoo, the cause of her taking the ground, and the attack on her and her crew by the natives, we will not dwell further on last year's proceedings. That they did not, however, have the result of giving security to trading steamers in the River Niger is indisputable. One of the earliest of the steamers up the river this season has come to grief. The native appetite for plunder will be whetted by the spoils they have acquired on this occasion, and increased peril to all steamers ascending the river for purposes of trade will be an inevitable result. The work of devoted missionaries in the Niger countries will avail but little for the progress of Christianity and civilization while the trading relations of Europeans with the natives are in so unsatisfactory a state. In an article on Trade in the Upper Gambia, we referred to this unsatisfactory state of affairs in the Niger, and we think it is a matter for serious consideration on the part of Her Majesty's Government, who are now called upon from time to time to send up ships of war to inflict punishments which do not seem to have any permanent effect in the way of repression, whether this sort of thing is to go on ad infinitum. We certainly fail to see on what grounds Her Majesty's Government deny protection to traders in the Upper Gambia, who would pay import and export duties at Bathurst, and grant it, at great expense and continual risk, to traders in the River Niger, who pay no duties whatever, and who possibly themselves create the necessity for the costly interference of Her Majesty's Government, by violence and wrong toward the natives. The question is full of difficulties, and they are difficulties that must be dealt with. We have no means at present for ascertaining what is the annual amount of trade in the River Niger, and some means ought to be adopted by which such information may be obtained. The late Earl of Clarendon, when at the Foreign Office, made provision for the establishment of a British Consular Authority up the River Niger, and nominated Mr. J. Lyons McLeod, formerly Consul at Mozambique, to the not very desirable post. Her Majesty's present Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs abolished this Consulate, on the double ground that the then actual amount of trade in the River Niger was not such as to justify the expense, and that it was not advisable to have a British Consul residing at any place where he could not be protected by Her Majesty's Government without difficulty. We presume that the trade in the River Niger has considerably increased since the period at which Mr. McLeod was recalled and placed on the retired list on such grounds; and if we are also to have annual ascents of the river by Her Majesty's steamers to protect the traders, it would surely be better to re-appoint Mr. McLeod to a Niger Consulate, in order that Her Majesty's Government might have constant reliable information as to the trade in the river, and the way in which it is conducted by the traders; and that there might be some competent authority on the spot to whom difficulties between the natives and the traders could be referred, and by whom they might be authoritatively settled. We are very much disposed to think that by this means the necessity for frequent ascents of the river by Her Majesty's ships of war might be obviated, and peace in the river be so promoted as to lead to a great development of trade, and promote the spread of civilization and Christianity among the natives.""}, {'id': 3447, 'article_title': 'Great Want of an English Consul for the River Niger', 'full_section_title': 'Great Want of an English Consul for the River Niger', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1877#article-21', 'issue_date': '01_11_1877', 'content': 'Sir,—Trusting you may not find it inconvenient to insert this communication in your valuable paper, and that it may thus come under the favourable notice of the proper authorities who have the power, and that they may be induced to take the matter into consideration, I respectfully direct this to you; and I think that upon mature consideration, you will agree with me in the feasibility of what I am about to urge—viz., the appointment of a British Consul for the River Niger.'}, {'id': 3447, 'article_title': 'Great Want of an English Consul for the River Niger', 'full_section_title': 'Great Want of an English Consul for the River Niger', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1877#article-21', 'issue_date': '01_11_1877', 'content': '\n\nThe Niger, I think it will be allowed, is not at all an unimportant portion of Africa, and is becoming more and more important every year, as its resources become more and more developed. It is well known by Europeans, and more so by the Africans, that the Niger itself penetrates far into the interior of this vast Continent, and branches off into many, many countries, both north and south likewise, that are at present quite unknown to European and African travellers. Although there are many rivers both north and south of the entrance to the Niger, called by different names, but they are all tributary to the Niger. The Moko or Byou country, which is little if at all known by European travellers, is a vast country abounding in wealth-producing products, besides the Banen country and others, that I could mention. The Niger itself, or the countries thereon, are rich in minerals of all sorts; the soil is rich, capable of producing anything that will grow in a tropical climate, and there are many things to be got there that could be turned to valuable account in the European markets—tobacco; cotton; and indigo, as is well known, grows there spontaneously. The natives for the most part are docile, and eager for trade. These things you will please excuse me mentioning, as I may be thought to be wandering from the point, or wishing to appear very wise; but I wish merely to show, if possible, as far as my poor abilities go, the importance of the place, and that it deserves some consideration by the authorities in England, and which, I think, would be much to the benefit of English commerce on that river, and would be a good move towards that civilization of Africa at present so much spoken of in England. For the prevention of such like occurrences as have happened these last two years to the Sultan of Sockatoo, the necessity of the expense and risk of men-of-war vessels up that river, to insure the better conduct and treatment of the employees and natives by the captains and agents of firms whose vessels go there for the purpose of trade, and for the better and more reliable information as to amount of trade done, etc., I think it is necessary to appoint a competent person, whose constitution would stand the climate, to reside there as Consul. It is well known that all down this Coast, particularly such places as up the Niger, that the conduct of and treatment by the European agents and captains of even their own countrymen is most revolting and cruel, much more towards the natives. Tying up, torturing, flogging, and even shooting almost for the merest trifle, many people in England would scarce give credence to. It used to be the same in Benin, Brass, Bonny, and Calabar, and Camaroon Rivers, and still is so, only far less frequent since the mail packets have been established, thereby affording means of bringing these deeds to light; but up the Niger the custom is growing more and more every day, for the agents employed for that river are of the old Bonny stock, and carry their pet practices with them; and should things be allowed to continue, no means being taken to put a stop to them, it may eventually lead to most serious and disastrous results, for human nature will not for ever bear cruelty and oppression. It is, therefore, my most humble opinion that, establishing a Consulate on the Niger will at any rate be a more satisfactory and cheaper means of attaining the desired objects. Should the authorities take a favourable view of such suggestion, it would be well that the Consul should reside at some suitable place on that river, say, for instance, Lokoja, which is just at the confluence, that being looked upon since the establishment of the Model Farm there as the main centre, or otherwise, as called by the natives, the White Man\'s Town, and was allotted by King Massaba, the late King of Bida, as belonging to all English people that wished to settle on the Niger. The Consul should be furnished with a good, strong, and swift steam launch, requisitely furnished, and of such draught that she might be able to ply to any part of the river at any time of the year, as some of the merchant\'s launches that are now there. By such means the natives being occasionally visited by the Consul, and with some trifling present now and then to deserving chiefs, matters explained and inquired into as the case may be, and redress given when necessary, there would soon be confidence established and more friendly feelings exist, and would soon put a different aspect on affairs on that river, and establish a safer basis to trade, as well as a surer tendency to civilization; and surely the British Government can as well now as in former years, afford to maintain a Consul for that place. Most assuredly it can, particularly now that trade there is so much greater than it was. And if the present Colonial Secretary is so well disposed as we have been led to believe, and desires to bring forward deserving Africans, so as to fit them eventually to govern their own country, as has been said, now is an opportunity, one forwarded by finding and appointing one who might be competent for such an honourable position. Mr. Forsyth, of Lagos, for instance, who has had the honour of a personal interview with his lordship. He was some years in the Colonial Office, working his way up, until he became treasurer and clerk of counsel, and private secretary to his Excellency the Governor, besides other trustworthy posts. He has much experience in dealing with rough and ignorant natives, as well how to investigate and settle matters between civilized people, having some amount of legal knowledge, through which he was some time holding the post of Crown Prosecutor in the Lagos Court, and he is likewise well up in political matters, at least for an African; and one great, and I think the best quality about him is, that he will not be apt to be biased, or get above himself, as I am sorry to say is the great failing amongst us—viz., that of ""getting too big for our trousers;"" he being also a man that is well used to roughing it out, and being gifted with the ability of speaking many of the African languages, would be such a person as would just suit such a position as Consul for the River Niger, and would no doubt accept far less salary than a European would require for such a position, and in such a climate as that of the Niger.'}]","[{'document_title': 'The Consul for the Bight of Biafra', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We are authorized to announce that the Consulate for the Bights, vacant by the death of the late Consul Hartley, has been offered by Her Majesty’s Government to Mr. David Hopkins, now Consul at Loanda.

As it was of importance to Great Britain, who had already secured the remainder of the Niger, to prevent this mouth of it falling into the hands of any foreign Power, the British Consul at that time promised he would do all that lay in his power in the matter, and a temporary treaty was, on this understanding, signed for a period of six months.

On that occasion those personages did not put in an appearance, but the Consul informed them in writing that he would shortly return to negotiate a treaty with them, and that it was the opinion of the British Government that the principles of free trade should be carried out, and that the people of Brass were at liberty to trade wherever they chose. This message by no means satisfied the chiefs of this river, as the National African Company took care that they should not trade in any of the waters under its jurisdiction. Shortly afterwards, the Consul received a message to the effect that they did not intend to part with their country unless they obtained further privileges. Hence the recent visit of the Consul. Shortly afterwards the Consul summoned them to a ""palaver"" on board the *Watchful*—a summons which they neither answered nor obeyed. Thereupon, an officer was despatched with an ultimatum from the Consul, intimating that, if they did not obey his summons within twenty-four hours, the matter would be placed in the hands of the naval officer to take steps to enforce it. The chiefs thereupon obeyed the summons and appeared on board the *Watchful*, so as to avoid the consequences of refusal. They refused to agree to one article of the treaty—that which granted permission for the ministers of all religious denominations to reside in their territory, and erect places of worship therein.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1887#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.751, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Proposed Charter of the African Association', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'on a trading company for administering the whole of the country through which the Niger flows, and now great efforts were being made by the African Association Limited to obtain by Royal Charter similar powers over the palm oil river district—namely, Benin, Toreados, Brass, New Calabar, Bonny, Opobo, and Old Calabar. Since the charter was granted to the Niger Company several of his customers who had been connected with the Niger trade had written to him to say that it was impossible for anyone but the Niger Company themselves to do business, and so they were obliged to give up trading on that river. Consequently he took it upon himself to write to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, drawing attention to this fact and begging his lordship to take the matter in hand, and see that common fairness was done to all who were anxious to trade in the Niger River. In his own opinion justice would never be done to the natives and the merchants until the administrative department was altogether separated from the trade and from those engaged in trade. He would be very sorry to see such powers as had been given to the Niger Company conferred upon the African Association, because it was quite obvious the interests of the native traders and producers were not likely to be fairly dealt with where all questions in dispute had to be settled by the officers of a trading corporation interested in making the utmost profit for their employers. There was a large body of native traders and producers in the oil district, increasing in number and importance every year. If a monopoly were created, such as was being sought for, the native traders and producers would have only one large customer, who would buy their produce on his own terms. The revenue to be derived from the district, if administered by the government of a Crown colony or annexed to the colony of Lagos, would pay its administrative expenses, the trade of the palm oil rivers district being the most valuable of the West Coast of Africa. The Lagos colony itself, with a trade about a third the volume of that of the oil rivers, showed in ten years a surplus revenue of £65,000. In the memorial the inhabitants of Lagos said: ""The rivers comprising the deltas of the Bights of Benin and Biafra form a belt of outlets to a vast produce-yielding interior, rich with natural resources and teeming with hundreds of thousands of Africans who are ready and willing on favourable terms to grant admission to their countries, and to barter their produce and manufacturers for European goods and merchandise. To develop and build up this great commerce, and to Christianise and civilise the native population is the problem which her Majesty\'s Government is now called upon to solve. We have no hesitation in asserting that it can only be done by free, legitimate, and unfettered commerce, fostered and protected directly by her Majesty\'s Government, for there can be no two opinions as to the necessity for free and unfettered competition in the development of the commercial resources of a new and dormant country, and the results to commerce and civilisation in the littoral possessions of her Majesty on this coast abundantly testify as to what may be obtained under proper conditions; and Lagos could be cited as an instance in which the above influences have, within a very few years, transformed it from a barbarous and unimportant place into a progressive civilised colony, with a total export and import trade of £906,811, and a revenue of £58,000 per annum. We unhesitatingly assert that it is impossible for these results to be achieved by a trading company invested with administrative powers; for it would naturally, in its own interest, pursue a policy advantageous to itself, and which could have no other tendency than to stagnate the thrift and industry necessary to the healthy development of a country and its resources."" The administrative department of the colony of Lagos had worked very well for all concerned, and it seemed convenient to annex the oil rivers first to that colony. The district extended from 300 to 400 miles on the coast of Africa, between the German boundary and the Cameroons, and the eastern boundary of the British Crown colony of Lagos, and inland to the territories of the Niger Company, and over this area the African Association wished to have the monopoly of trade. The country was densely populated. This district was at present under Imperial protection and the jurisdiction of consular courts, which was better than under the administration of a company formed for private gain. It would be infinitely better under administration as a Crown colony, and he trusted that a Crown colony would be established in connexion with apart from the colony of Lagos.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1890#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.731, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Oil Rivers District', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The African Steamship Company\'s royal mail steamer Niger, which has recently arrived in the Mersey from the West Coast, brings information that on the 23rd March Consul Johnstone was at Buguma, having gone specially thither in H.M.S. Bramble to settle some trade disputes. Most of the cases were amicably settled, but some of the chiefs did not turn up, although they had received timely notice of the meeting. This was regarded as contempt of court, and as a result, the Consul proceeded in the Bramble to Bakana, and took as prisoners the Chiefs Will Braid and India Yellow. The chiefs were left in charge of the Consul\'s representative at Buguma. It was understood that Will Braid had not paid some penalty imposed on him, and that the Consul had taken the step to secure it.\n\nPrevious to the Consul visiting Buguma he went to Benin and held a great palaver at the factory of Messrs. Stuart & Douglas. This was for the purpose of officially declaring the British protectorate over the place, and of informing the great Chief Nanna what the conditions were. All the agents were present, and Chief Nanna sat on the Consul\'s right. The Consul explained that he had established a new British court, which would supersede the old Court of Equity. Rules would be sent by the Consul from Old Calabar, and these would have to be hung up. As in the cases of Bonny and the other rivers, the court was to have jurisdiction in both civil and criminal cases, and when the amount exceeded £5 an appeal would lie to the Consul. ""Comey,"" or trade tribute, was abolished, and in its place an export duty of 1s. 6d. per ton would be charged on palm oil and 6d. on kernels. When collected, one-half would be divided amongst the Governor (Nanna) and his chiefs, the balance to go towards maintaining peace on the river. The ""trust"" customs were to be abolished, and if the natives were found mixing shells with kernels or water with the palm oil they would be fined. Consul Johnstone said he was pleased with Nanna\'s conduct, particularly in sending the case of Mr. Reece, the British trader, to be dealt with by the Consul, and that he would tell Her Majesty the Queen of his conduct. Nanna seemed pleased with the prospect of being under Queen Victoria. The other native rulers are reported to be also similarly pleased with the idea of being under English rule.\n\nWhen the Niger left Bonny it was understood that H.M.S. Bramble was going to take Consul Johnstone to Opobo, in order that he might adjust matters there, particularly as regarded the white men going to the native markets, and also to settle the claims which the merchants were making for the damage received by them through their factories being burned down or otherwise destroyed by the natives some time ago.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1888#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.738, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger Trouble', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At a recent meeting of the African Trade Section of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, the following resolution was carried: ""That the members of the African Trade Section are of opinion that the charter granted to the Royal Niger Company, Limited, constitutes a virtual monopoly of the trade of the Niger district, thereby affecting prejudicially British interests in the adjoining rivers. The charter was obtained on the statement that all other European interests in that district had been bought up, which is not the case, and the members of the section are therefore of opinion that the charter should be revoked.""

What are the facts? A company not long in existence has been granted sovereign rights and taxing powers over the imports and exports of from five to eight millions of people, and no company trading for its own benefit can exercise such powers in an impartial manner. Powers such as these can only be properly used by an independently-organized body, altogether unconnected with trade. Probably the Government having negotiated treaties with countries up the Niger, were glad to transfer their responsibility to the first who asked for it. Nominally there was to be no monopoly, but practically the greater number of traders are entirely debarred from doing business, and instead of there being free trade, open to all comers, the trade is absolutely shut up.

The Board is convinced that the time has now arrived when her Majesty\'s Government may advantageously take into consideration the subject of the better administration of these regions. I am instructed respectfully to state that after full examination of the subject the Board has been led to the conclusion that the union of the Royal Niger Company\'s territory, the Niger Coast Protectorate, and Lagos in one colony under the control of the Colonial Office would afford the surest basis for the removal of these difficulties. The advantages offered by this arrangement are that the present Customs and boundary troubles would be done away with, that complications with foreign Powers would be minimised, and that great economies would be rendered possible in the cost of administration. Should, however, her Majesty\'s Government find it impracticable to bring about such an amalgamation at present, the Board desires to urge that whatever may be done in the meantime, falling short of this, should be considered to be of a temporary nature, having in view the ultimate consolidation of these territories under one Government. In any case the Board is of opinion that as an interim step the present boundary between Nigeria and the Niger Coast Protectorate should be abolished, the interior customs ports removed, and the two districts placed under the administration of the Colonial Office, or that some other arrangement should be made withdrawing the administrative powers of the Royal Niger Company, equitable compensation being paid to the Company for the large sums of money spent and the great services rendered by it in preserving to the British flag this large and populous tract of Africa.\n\n""If neither of these courses should be thought desirable, it appears absolutely necessary that a Custom\'s Union, to which the three administrations should be parties, should be established with as little delay as possible, with a view to the removal of the difficulties already referred to.—I have, &c.,\n\n(Signed) **Elijah Helm, Sec.**', 'last_edit_date': '1897-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1897#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.735, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH TRADE IN THE NIGER REGION', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Whatever may be the result of the Conference at Berlin, one important advantage will have been gained—viz., the opening of the eyes of Great Britain to the unassisted part that she has played during the past fifty years in the development of Central Africa north of the equator, and to her rights and duty to continue to act as the protector of the Lower Niger and Binue rivers, which, with their important tributaries, form one system which I will designate as the Niger-Binue. This term is in contradistinction to the Upper Niger, from Timbuctoo to the sources, which runs for a distance of 1,000 miles at the back of the French colony of Senegal, and which has been visited by several French exploring parties, though as yet no European trade has been opened there. Nor, indeed, can such trade be carried on profitably until the completion of the railway connecting the waterways of the Senegal and the Upper Niger. Between the latter and the Niger-Binue lies the long stretch of the Middle Niger, from Timbuctoo to Boussa; nature thus interposing a barrier of 800 miles between the Upper Niger basin, which will probably fall to France, and the Niger-Binue basin, which is already occupied by Great Britain. The Niger-Binue was unknown to Europe fifty-five years ago. The wildest theories were held as to the ultimate destination of the Niger—some geographers holding that it was absorbed by an inland sea, others that it fell into the Nile, others that it joined the Congo. The English traveller, John Lander, in 1831 solved the problem by starting from Badagry, and travelling northwards till he reached the Niger, near Boussa, where are the lowest rapids, and where commences the Niger-Binue system. He followed the river down 600 miles to the sea. Immediately on his return home, in 1832, his great discovery was turned to account by some Liverpool merchants, who despatched two steamers to nearly the highest navigable point on the Niger, and to Dagbo on the Binue. Numerous private expeditions from this country followed in the years 1834 to 1864, the most notable event being the formation in 1852 of the African Steamship Company, which established a line to Lokoga at the confluence of the Niger and Binue, 300 miles from the sea. Meanwhile the British Government had made efforts to open up both branches, and to lay down charts. Under an impulse given by Prince Consort, Parliament voted over £50,000 for the expedition of Her Majesty’s ships Albert, Wilberforce, and Soudan, during which the Government obtained the cession of a large tract of country about the confluence at Lokoga, where the British flag flies to this day. Another important expedition was that of 1854-5, during which were laid down most careful charts of the Binue for some hundreds of miles. In 1857 Parliament voted a five years' subsidy, averaging £7,000 a year, to Mr. Macgregor Laird, to assist him in developing trade in these rivers, and it was expressly stated on that occasion that immediate results could not be expected, but that posterity would reap the benefit. In a letter dated the 29th April, 1864, Earl Russell stated that he was willing to recommend a further subsidy of £6,000 for the same object. The proposal fell through—indeed, was rendered unnecessary by the springing up of British trade, which has lasted to the present day."", 'last_edit_date': '1884-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1884#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.737, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE GOVERNMENT OF THE OIL RIVERS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Considering how unsatisfactory is the present administration of this district, so far as concerns what is intended to be the protection of British interests, by means of a consular establishment at Old Calabar, we trust that her Majesty's Government will speedily modify this arrangement. We desire, however, to record our earnest protest against the proposal which, as we understand, is now being urged on her Majesty's Government for the transfer of control over the district, under a charter similar to that possessed by the Royal Niger Company, to a private corporation of merchants.\n\nWe do not here offer any remarks on the policy which led to the constitution of the Royal Niger Company, or on the mode in which it has thus far exercised its powers. But we feel very strongly that, whatever warrant there may have been for the organisation of that Company, whose object is to carry on trade with the tribes and communities in the interior, with whom it has established treaty relations, and to utilise the resources of the territories of which it has acquired possession, there is no warrant for assigning to private speculators similar authority over the coasts between the Benin and Old Calabar rivers, and on both sides of the principal mouth of the Niger. Through this mouth the Royal Niger Company has access by water to...\n\nthe vast and in many parts salubrious and fertile regions owned or regulated by it, whereas in the Oil Rivers District there are but few localities fit for European settlement or suitable for any industrial operations requiring such large outlay of capital and other costly enterprise as it may be proper to leave in private hands.\n\nAt no time can it be expected that the Oil Rivers District will prove valuable or attractive to Europeans, except as regards the towns and trading depôts established on the coast, and the commodities brought thither by natives and thence conveyed to foreign countries. Its ports may and should become far more prosperous marts than they now are; but, so far as white men are concerned, it can never be much more than a resort for merchants who will look to the natives for a supply of the articles they desire to obtain. The business which is already established here, and which is capable of great expansion under wholesome direction and restraint, is, we submit, especially of a sort that, if carried on by British enterprise, should not be withdrawn from the supervision of the British Government. A firmer and more just administration than it is conceivable that any association of merchants would be able to exercise is required, not only to prevent the dangers attending the setting up of an unfair monopoly by such an association against other traders, but yet more to protect the natives from tyranny, extortion and degradation."", 'last_edit_date': '1890-07-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.73, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""THE ROYAL NIGER COMPANY'S TERRITORIES"", 'section_title': '', 'content': ""My Lord,—I am directed to say, that the letter addressed to this Chamber by the Foreign Office on the 2nd February last on the above-named subject has been reported upon by the committee of the African Trade Section, to whose consideration it had been referred. A very great interest has long been taken by this Chamber in the affairs of both the Niger and Oil Rivers districts, in which districts members of its African Trade Section have a large amount of capital at stake. When it became publicly known that a charter had been granted to the Royal Niger Company, the African Trade Section passed a resolution protesting against the charter on the ground that their large interests in the delta of the Niger, and their growing interest in the trade of the river itself, were likely to be seriously prejudiced by the powers bestowed upon the Company. It was felt as a grievance that this Chamber had not received any intimation of the intention of the Government to grant a trading company jurisdiction over countries discovered, redeemed from the export slave traffic, and generally brought under British influence by national efforts and expenditure, and wherein members of its African Trade Section had long traded, and were making efforts to extend their trade; that trade having, moreover, had a civilising influence upon the tribes of the delta. Your lordship will remember the very strenuous efforts made by this Chamber in the year 1890 to prevent the granting of a charter for the Oil Rivers district. The movement for such a charter doubtless arose, in part, out of the desire to preserve the commercial interests at the Oil Rivers from the complications and injuries resulting from the position and policy of the Royal Niger Company, but the granting of it would have secured to the applicants a monopoly of the trade of the Oil Rivers similar in character to that of the Niger trade already possessed by the Royal Niger Company. It has been the object of this Chamber to keep those countries of West Africa which have been acquired by national effort and expenditure open for all British traders, and it therefore rejoiced when the Government, acceding to its representations, resolved that the Oil Rivers districts should continue under direct Imperial control. The Chamber regrets to learn that her Majesty's Secretary of State, instead of limiting the administration of the Royal Niger Company to the main stream of the Niger, as the direct approach to the countries where its trade is situated, is about to sanction, or has sanctioned, the extension of the jurisdiction of the Company over one-fourth of the area of the Oil Rivers district, thereby consenting to the appropriation by the Company of districts which fed the trade of Benin and Brass, and to the separation of the Benin district from the Brass, Bonny, and Calabar districts. The description in the letter from the Foreign Office of the geographical features of the Wari district is applicable to the whole of the delta of the Niger, and whilst it is felt that, owing to the character of the delta, it will be impossible for the Company to exercise effective control over the waterways assigned to them, this Chamber views with great apprehension the attempts likely to be made to acquire a control, which will harass the merchants of the Oil Rivers and will probably lead to conflicts with the natives. The Chamber objects to the division of the Oil Rivers district for the following reasons, viz.: (1) That it is naturally one district; (2) that its waterways should not be under two separate and conflicting jurisdictions and fiscal systems; (3) that there should be no regulations in respect to its waterways calculated to obstruct free navigation of channels and creeks which are maintained by natural forces, and which, in the absence of the possibility of roads, are the highways of the district; (4) that the Wari districts were placed, by treaties, under the protection of the British Government prior to the making of any treaties by the Royal Niger Company, and that the British Consul recognised and enforced that condition by his action when the claims of the Company were first put forward; and the Chamber, moreover, in order to secure to the Oil Rivers Administration its proper sphere of development and its natural hinterground, respectfully submits that the Delta of the Niger should be placed under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner and Consul-General for the Oil River Protectorate. It is urged that this step will inflict no injustice upon the Company. The National African Company Limited, when petitioning for a charter, represented that they had purchased the business of all European traders in the basin of the River Niger. They, however, neither compensated the smaller traders of Lagos, Sierra Leone, and this country, who were striving together with the larger firms to develop the Niger trade, who up to the date of the charter enjoyed free trade on the river, and who strongly protested against the loss of that privilege, nor did the Company buy up any portion of the much greater interests of the merchants of Oil Rivers (including Wari), who are again injured by the proposed extension of the charter over the districts between the Nun and the Forcados rivers, wherein Benin and Brass merchants have long carried on a trade created by their capital and enterprise. This Chamber does not mistake the terms of the charter, and is not under the impression that any traders are excluded from the Company's markets otherwise than by the obligation to pay the exorbitant license fees and duties imposed by the Company, and by the regulations enforced against their competitors in trade. Monopoly is prohibited and differential treatment is forbidden by Article 14 of the Company's charter, but so long as the Company are allowed to claim as their private property the land on both banks of the river and continue to be both a governing and trading body, they will legislate and execute for their own special advantage in trade. The almost total extinction of rival trade to that of the Company in the Niger Protectorate, where formerly there was so much competition, is a proof that the unfair influence and policy of the Company have secured them a monopoly. The fact that the details of the revenue and expenditure of the Company are kept from the public, and that there is therefore no proof that the Company exact the licenses from their own agents which they impose upon the agents of other traders, or that they debit themselves with the duties which they levy upon others, leaves them open to the charge of trading under a preferential system favourable to their own interests. It is recommended that the boundary of the Royal Niger Company's territories be altered so as to restore to the Oil Rivers district the Delta of the Niger as far as Onitcha, Asaba remaining in the possession of the Company, and Onitcha being included in the Oil Rivers Protectorate, and that the rights of the Company in respect to the navigation of the river be guarded in the spirit of the free navigation clauses of the Act of Berlin, to which the Foreign Office refers."", 'last_edit_date': '1892-05-24', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1892#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.726, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Progress on the West African Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The African rivers situate in the Bight of Benin, commonly known as the Oil Rivers, have been placed under the protectorate of Great Britain.

The existence of chartered companies is only tolerable in uncivilised or semi-civilised countries, where the presence of a strong commercial interest may often enable the governing body to provide for the administration of the district without the great expense that would have to be incurred by the home Government if they attempted the direct administration themselves. The history of the development of India under the fostering rule of the Honourable East India Company proves the correctness of this theory, and to her Majesty's ministers it appears that the Royal Niger Company occupies an analogous position in its own district. The charter which was granted to the Niger Company some years ago is sufficiently careful in safeguarding the interests of others, and the success which has attended its administration of the district in question appears fully to justify an extension of its authority in the direction of the Oil Rivers.

Efforts to effect stoppage of the trade led to new activities by British traders, consuls, and naval officers, resulting in new relationships with the delta states. First, it led to an increased British presence in the Bight of Bonny. For example, in 1827 a naval squadron was stationed at Fernando Po, and in 1849,$^{ tne}$ & $^{TSt}$ British consul, John Beecroft, was appointed for the entire territories of the Bights of Benin and Bonny. The Court of Mixed Commissions was also set up at Freetown, Sierra Leone, to try the captains of captured slave ships, and to set free the slaves of condemned slavers. For the delta states, these developments meant the demonstration of British power in their waters, bringing the era of gunboat diplomacy in which the British consuls used naval power to negotiate favourable conditions for British traders, missionaries, and explorers. In practice, the consuls, especially after 1850, continued and stepped up a policy started in the 1830s by Edward Nicolls, Governor of Fernando Po, of signing treaties with the local chiefs.$^{6}$ These treaties stipulated the stoppage of the slave trade by the rulers; the adoption of 'legitimate trade', that is, trade in goods other than slaves; laid down regulations for the conduct of legitimate trade; specified the sums of customs duties or comey to be paid by the traders, as well as subsidies that the British government was to pay the local rulers for their agreement to give up the slave trade.\nThese British activities on the coast gradually eroded the power of the local rulers, especially when the consuls and naval officers assisted the British traders to set up their own judicial systems over and above the law of the local states, the so-called Courts of Equity, composed mainly of British traders with the participation of a few local House Heads or chiefs.

The inter-state wars did not weaken the resolve of each of the states to keep European traders from encroaching on their spheres of trade or in the maintenance of their sovereignty. The British had clashed with King William Pepple of Bonny as early as 1854, when they exiled him to Fernando Po, Ascension, Sierra Leone and London. They used disturbances caused by local feuds as an excuse. In 1887 they could find no such excuse when they removed Jaja of Opobo for his opposition to direct British trade in the Imo river valley. The rulers of Nembe (Brass), lying on the main Nun estuary of the Niger, were involved in quarrels between exploring and trading British expeditions and local peoples from the 1830s when British citizens got killed or shot at. The final showdown came in 1895, when the Nembe attacked the major depot of the Royal Niger Company at the port of Akassa and destroyed it. This was in protest against the Company's attempt to establish monopoly trade all the way up from Akassa in the delta to Lokoja at the Niger-Benue confluence. Also in 1898, King Ibanichuka of Okrika was seized by the British consul for his refusal to take orders from the new British Protectorate government of Southern Nigeria.

He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order. When Jaja still refused to comply in spite of Johnston's threats to bombard his town with British gunboats, Johnston enticed Jaja on board a ship in 1887 under a promise of safeconduct but arrested him and sent him to Accra$^{49}$ where he was tried and deported to the West Indies.

Many decades of British efforts to discover the course and sources of the Niger river were crowned with success when Richard and John Lander were brought from Aboh to Nembe (Brass) by its ruler, King Boy Amain, in 1830. Once the estuaries of the many rivers of the Niger delta were shown to be the entrance to the great Niger river, British interest was greatly increased in the area as a highway into the rich interior of Nigeria and West Africa. British traders, such as Macgregor Laird, as well as humanitarians and missionaries tried to move up the delta into the hinterland between the 1830s and 1850s.\nIn the eastern delta itself, the Church Missionary Society under the leadership of the Nigerian ex-slave, Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther, estab› lished missions at Bonny in 1864, at Twon-Brass in the Nembe kingdom in 1868, at Elem Kalahari (New Calabar in the documents) in 1874, and at Okrika in 1880. Both at Bonny and Nembe, the rulers invited the missionaries for a number of reasons. Some wished to have the missionaries establish schools in which their children could learn to read, write and speak English in order to carry on their commercial relations with British firms. It was also believed that permission for the missionaries would lead to better relations with the British government, represented by the consuls and naval officers, and serve to strengthen them against neighbouring states in internal power struggles. These same reasons sometimes led to the missionaries being rejected in other parts of the eastern delta. Thus, once the Church Missionary Society was established at Bonny, Jaja of Opobo, who had broken away from Bonny in 1869 to form his state of Opobo, would have nothing to do with that mission. The establishment of Christian missions was, however, resisted by powerful interests within each of the delta states, and Christianity constituted a factor of social instability in the nineteenth century.

Encouraged by Porto Novo itself, a French protectorate was declared over this coastal Aja state in 1863 to check further British advance along the coast to the west. Both the British and the French soon discovered the obvious: that the real value of Lagos or Porto Novo was to be measured in terms of the trade with the hinterland in the Yoruba and Aja interior which the two ports shared. This involvement of both Britain and France in the trade and politics of Lagos and Porto Novo respectively sparked off a spell of dramatic rivalry between the two powers in a bid to control Yorubaland, especially the western parts, and the adjacent Aja-speaking communities.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts.

This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.\nIn the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium. Major Christian missionary bodies such as the Church Missionary Society (CMS) of the Church of England and the Lyons-based SociØtØ des Missions Africaines (SMA) of the Roman Catholic Church each employed a mix of European nationals. Father Boghero, who led the SMA in an effort to re› introduce Roman Catholic Christianity to West Africa in the nineteenth century, was an Italian. The pioneer SMA Fathers in most parts of the area which became Nigeria were French, just as it was such British missionaries as Thomas Birch Freeman of the Methodists and Samuel Ajayi Crowther of the CMS who pioneered the work of Christian missions in what was to become French Dahomey (present-day People's Republic of Benin).$^{33}$ British, French, German and Portuguese traders set up businesses adjacent to one another and, as the case of Badagry clearly demonstrated, there were residential quarters for diverse European nationals in the major ports all along the coast of the Bight of Benin.\nTraders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The changing balance of power', 'content': ""Similarly, most African leaders were very suspicious of European missionaries. Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Models of African initiatives and reactions', 'content': ""War-weariness and insecurity contributed greatly to the acceptance of British wardship or alliance on the part of several African polities and individuals.

Thus Indian traders were not only allowed, but, to some extent, were also encouraged to patronize trade in East Africa, and to some extent in Central Africa.

The 'dislike and distrust of the Levantine communities' in West Africa, which Professor Bauer noticed to be 'marked in official circles', 71 was a relatively recent development. Real hostility towards the Levantines, mostly Lebanese, came not from official circles but from the various European agents of commercial firms, and such hostility was in response to effective trade rivalry presented by the Levantines.$^{72}$ And where British firms appear to have been given preference, it was not because of their respectability, but because they could - with the blessing of the British government - act as effective pressure groups and influence colonial policy› makers. 73 Still, Ehrlich's generalization that 'administrative attitudes, throughout British Africa, rarely encouraged indigenous commercial initiative'$^{74}$ is quite valid. But other factors stifled local initiatives. First of all, general official policy, as would be expected in a colonial situation, was geared primarily towards the advancement of imperialist interests. Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction. By the first decade of the twentieth century, following the construction of railways, European firms were squeezing African traders in two related ways. Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

When King Leopold called an international conference in Brussels in 1876 'to discuss methods of peaceful and co- operative action to develop legitimate commerce and attack the slave trade',$^{62}$ the rivalry was already appearing on the surface. The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo. The most significant action of the period was the British occupation of Egypt in 1882. For the British the action was justified because of the strategic position of Egypt (with the Suez Canal and the Nile) for British interests in India and East Africa, although East Africa was considered of less importance. But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year. In West Africa Germany and France were beginning to stand together to challenge the British position on the Niger. The 'high tide of imperialism' had begun to flow. When Bismark convened the Berlin Conference in November 1884, the process of partitioning Africa had already started. In East Africa Carl Peters had already arrived in Zanzibar under the auspices of his Gesellschaft für Deutsche Kolonisation (German Colonization Society) and had gone inland to negotiate treaties.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

When he ascended the throne in 1894, he seemed to be suspicious of Europeans, mostly missionaries at that time, so he sought to restrict his people's interactions with them. Those among the Baganda who had embraced the Christian faith and who would not obey his orders were put to death as traitors.$^{29}$ Today, Christians regard them as martyrs. Mwanga was, however, violently resisting attempts by British agents to take over his country even though disguised as mission› aries. But his diplomatic ability also became apparent in the way he handled various, often warring religious sects. At one time, he would play the two Christian sects, Catholics and Protestants, against Muslims when he thought the latter were becoming too powerful and therefore threatening his control of the country. At another time, he would ally with Muslims against Catholics or Protestants or both depending on who he thought was dangerous to his rule. Thus, Mwanga was adept at the diplomatic game of divide and rule, a tactic which the colonizing powers were able to use so effectively in controlling Africa. When it was necessary, Mwanga resorted to a revival of some old tradition in an attempt to drive out all foreigners as happened in 1888.$^{30}$ On this occasion, he intended to entice all foreigners and their Baganda followers to a naval parade on an island on Lake Victoria. There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler.

The British protectorate, as you are aware, is extended over a large portion of the Coast of Africa, which stretches from the settlement of Sierra Leone to the district of the Niger. Upon this coast, excluding the State of Liberia and the neighbourhood of Whydah, the port of Dahomey, there are three French settlements—viz., Grand Bassam, Assinie, and Porto Novo; also portions of coast unprotected by any European Power. West of Grand Bassam there is unoccupied coast of considerable extent; east of Lagos, beyond Leckie, and reaching to Old Calabar, there is the important territory at the mouths of the Niger. Quite recently the Germans have taken certain ports on this coast—viz., Ahgweh, Bageida, and Little Popo. At these there was a thriving and increasing British trade, and with the chiefs of Ahgweh and Little Popo treaties had been made on behalf of Her Majesty, securing the right of British subjects to trade on equal terms with those of any other nation. The occupation by France and the late annexations by Germany break the continuity of the British protectorate; there is an increasing conflict of the various national interests, and the influence of the British authorities with the natives is being lessened; the introduction of different principles of trading will also seriously affect the prosperity of British commerce. It is important to mention in this connexion that the duties upon spirits, arms, and ammunition levied in the British settlements furnish the greater portion of the Government revenue. In German and French settlements these articles are known, in most cases, to be free of duty, and being sold to a great extent in the same markets as the British imports, competition becomes difficult, and the loss to the British revenue and trade must ultimately be great. The Chamber would suggest, therefore, that while negotiations regarding African territories are pending, something might be done in the way of exchange or by mutual concession to induce Germany, at least, to withdraw from those newly acquired ports where British trade had become established, and where German rivalry upon different principles is likely to be so injurious. This Government might also be requested to take into consideration the question of the extension of the British protectorate to the unprotected portion of the coast named.—I am, &c.,\n\n""C. B.

BADEN-POWELL ON WEST AFRICA AND ITS TRADE', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir George Baden-Powell said he went to West Africa with the pre-conceived wish that he should know the true state of affairs in every portion of the British Empire. He knew that a great many of his constituents were connected with the West African trade, and that he should be doing a service to his constituents and to Liverpool if he visited the West Coast and returned to Parliament as a man who could say to those who were treating them wrongly that such was the case, and that he knew it. He could not on the present occasion go thoroughly into such a great subject, but they would expect him to indicate some of the chief results of the inquiries which he made. He wanted, in the first place, to find out how the West African settlements were governed. He did not think the people of England understood the magnitude of the trade with that coast. The figures show that during the past ten or fifteen years their trade with the West Indies had fallen to £6,000,000, while that with West Africa had risen from £1,500,000 to £5,000,000. He had looked round on these colonies, and he felt that they should not give up any one of them, but that they should try to acquire others. He had been to the Gambia, and he found the general talk was that the Gambia must fall into the hands of the French. It seemed to him that the Gambia was a most valuable possession on the Coast. He also went to Sierra Leone, which was the only harbour on the Coast available for ocean-going ships, with the exception of Decka and the Isles de Los. He need not mention the great importance these places were to British trade. With regard to the Natives he was surprised to find so much prosperity, so much vigour, and so much inclination to follow agriculture and the productive arts. He imagined that the Natives would have been hardly worthy of notice, but he had come away with the very opposite feelings. In his opinion these Natives were worthy of the highest attention, and might be cultivated and improved to a high degree. He wished this country would notice the widespread existence of slavery on the West Coast, but with a view of substituting for it that civilisation with which that country would be blessed. Twenty years ago England seemed paramount in that part of Africa; but the French and Germans soon after that became competitors on the West Coast of Africa. He thought they got along with the Germans pretty well now, because they endeavoured to co-operate with our traders in the matter of Customs duties, &c. Of the French he feared they could not say that. They had started with the grand idea of founding a French African empire and to break up the Native opposition, but in no case had they endeavoured to set up any form of commercial basis for their expeditions or colonies. The Portuguese could hardly be described as having more than a foothold on the coast; and the same might be said of the Republic of Liberia. Dealing with the Government of the West Coast of Africa, the general policy of every Government was so changeable that foreign nations did not know precisely what the British Government were driving at. He did not think the English people appreciated the great extent of territory and the large population which had been placed under the British flag. There were large areas which British traders did not penetrate, but they might at once bring all these areas under the control of their trade, and those who wished to invest capital should not fail to seize upon such opening. People might ask how was it to be done. To his mind the matter was simplicity itself. They wanted to put a little more brain power into the work. He had himself urged upon the Government the advantage of establishing proper administration over the Native districts; he had to do it in what was known as North Bechuanaland. He had studied the projects for railways in Africa, and he had also inspected the only railway in tropical Africa, from Decka to San Louis, 150 miles long. It was made by the French, and although it was managed on a wrong financial principle, it had opened up a large tract of country, and was bringing down an unexpected amount of produce. He was convinced that two, three, or four railways could be built into the interior, and would certainly largely increase the trade of West Africa. There was another matter too large to be touched upon. The revenue was derived from Customs duties on imports and exports. This was a matter which was international, and should be taken up by all the nations having interests on the West Coast. They should fix the duties on the same basis throughout West Africa, because they wanted the Trade to go down by the easiest route. Again, there should be some means of promotion amongst the officials. They should make one big civil service, at least including the West Indies and the West Coast, so that they would have good men able for the work ready to fill any vacancy that might occur. He took an intelligent view of the subject, not because he had acquired much information on one short visit, but because it had given him the opportunity of gleaning from the fertile brains of many of the best merchants on the coast. There was another matter he wished to deal with, and that was the question of the coaling stations. At the present moment they had no place where British warships could coal and repair between Devonport and Cape Town, a distance of 6,000 miles. There were only four ports all down the West Coast available for large vessels, and three of them were British. One was Decka, which the French had made as strong a port as they could, with water boats and every facility. The others were Bathurst, Isles do Los, and Sierra Leone. The British Government had done nothing to make these ports available for coaling, or for watering, &c. In regard to the troubles on the Brass river, a full inquiry would be made into the matter. This inquiry should be thorough, and he believed it would bring about some assimilation of these Customs duties he had spoken about. He would not fail to try to press this matter of duties as far as Parliament had power to do so. They would say that his views of West African affairs were very sanguine. As he had said, he looked for a great development of trade if a strong administration was established and if the Government properly supported the merchants and traders. Trade would also do good for the Natives, and tend to wipe out the stain of the miseries of the slave-trade, which they were the people to initiate.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-03-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_05_1895#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The aim of his discourse was to arouse English opinion to more vigorous efforts by exhibiting the riches of the field ready to reward them. He reminded his hearers that England once had a free hand, and did not profit by her opportunities. The Gambia is among the oldest English colonies. It commands the mouth of a navigable waterway, along which England's authority might have spread over the whole interior. From want of energy France has been allowed to take the upper waters under its protection; and the result is that the Gambia colony has to be described as small and retrograding. Not much better things can be said of the settlement of Sierra Leone. Its confines might have been expanded to take in the Upper Niger, which has its sources not far from the Sierra Leone boundary. At one time it was practicable to conciliate the friendship of the Mahommedan chief, Samadu, who has been building up an empire inland. The chance was postponed, and now Samadu has placed his kingdom under the protection of France. The colony of Lagos is the sole plantation at which Mr. Johnston can glance without vexation. There, though the Government delays to move the front of the harbour, and though official supineness is answerable for the interposition of wedges of foreign territory between Lagos and the Gold Coast, the spirit of English enterprise is seen. Trade has advanced by leaps and bounds. The settlement in its first year, 1862-3, counted it as £329,479; and in 1887 it was £906,812. He would hesitate to put limits to the prosperity and importance of the place. Yet nothing has been effected at Lagos which could not have been accomplished in Gambia and Sierra Leone. The blame for the shortcomings to be discovered in British West Africa he does not attribute to British traders. The community engaged in conducting mercantile undertakings in West Africa he characterises as a set of genial, good-hearted Englishmen, sagacious and just in their dealings. Of the officials he also speaks in complimentary language. British West Africa has ceased to be a refuge for ruined spendthrifts, of whom their families rejoiced to rid themselves. West African Governors of the present type instruct the natives in the vegetable riches of their own land, and the acclimatisation of useful foreign plants, and they cultivate a fashion among their staffs of learning the native languages. In the past the lethargy which kept British West Africa back, and invited European competition, was universal. Public opinion at home is still far from being alive to the magnitude of the prospects in West Africa, and to the ignorance and inertness which threaten to mar and cloud them."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.712, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The present is a very critical time in the history of the British West African Colonies. It is a fact well within the knowledge of all interested in the welfare of the oldest British colony in Africa that for some years past the French, by means of treaties made with the chiefs of the Upper Niger and Western Soudan, have been gradually encroaching upon the hitherto not very well-defined boundaries of the Colony of Sierra Leone, with the result of gradually reducing the British sphere of influence, and at the same time narrowing the field from which the merchants and traders of that Colony draw their native produce, and in which, in return, they have been in the habit of finding a market for their imported goods. Rather more than two years ago, an agreement was concluded at Paris between our Government and that of France with regard to the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence in West Africa. The territories referred to in the agreement were Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast. It was provided that the two Governments should have the right of appointing special Commissions of Delimitation ""to trace upon the spot, wherever they may consider it necessary, the line of demarcation between the English and French possessions"" in conformity with the agreement. The work of determining the boundary line between Senegambia and Sierra Leone is now about to be begun, the British Commissioners having left Liverpool on Saturday last. For some time past British merchants interested in commerce with Sierra Leone have been apprehensive that their trade with the interior might be seriously interfered with, if not absolutely ruined, by a wrongful definition of the boundary. Our trade with Sierra Leone is mainly dependent upon the caravan traffic between the British port of Freetown and the upper portion of the Niger.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TRADE IN BRITISH WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '2. Every effort should be made to open commercial relations with tribes hitherto inaccessible, either by inviting the visits of caravans from a distance, as a recent Governor of Sierra Leone did, or by encouraging exploring expeditions by British officers and others, as has been done in Ashanti and the countries beyond, from Cape Coast, or by attempting to arbitrate between contending tribes in the interests of commerce, as has been done in the Yoruba territory from Lagos. During the last decade, the Church, Scotch, and London Missionary Societies have shown themselves more enterprising on the east of Africa than on the west; and yet in the rivers of Western Africa there are better highways to the interior than the caravan route into the Galla and Wagogo countries. The physical difficulties which exist, together with the political subdivision of the country, ought not to prevent direct communication with the potentates of Senegambia, Gando and Sockatu on the west any more than with Uganda and Unyamiwezi on the east. As the Germans seem determined to invade commercially the countries on the great branch of the Niger called the Binué Chadda, it is time that the British Missionary and Trading Societies should open up the countries in the Upper Niger and the Gambia to the Christian religion, commerce, and freedom.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1885#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.723, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Commercial Value of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Altogether our West African possessions do a trade with Great Britain (mainly with Liverpool, London, and Bristol) of about £5,000,000 yearly, give honourable employment to some 770 of our British fellow-countrymen, and bring at least 5,000,000 of intelligent (Sierra Leone), sturdy (Krumen), industrious (Gold Coast), artistic (Yoruba), brave (Niger), good-tempered (Oil Rivers) negroes under our sway. I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain. If we gave away the Gold Coasts or Lagos, or the Niger, for instance, in exchange for concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or the North Atlantic, the ratio of loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be far greater than the gain to the Australians or the Newfoundlanders. To those who argue that our missionaries and merchants might go on working in West Africa just the same, even if the rule in our possession were transferred to another Power, I would ask, \'How many British merchants are there in French Senegambia? What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value. Then as to Zanzibar and British East Africa, they, in their turn, besides securing the southern approach to the dominions of our Egyptian ward, are a necessity to the trade and overflow emigration of our great Indian Empire, with its nearly 300,000,000 of people and its yearly trade with the British Empire of some £90,000,000. The trade of the British Empire with British Africa amounts to about £25,200,000 yearly. Among the more valuable products which British Africa sends us, or supplies to herself, may be cited the following: gold, silver, copper, coal, diamonds, ivory, rubber, palm oil, palm kernels, gums, cotton, dyewoods, indigo, coffee, sugar, rice, Indian corn, horses, cattle, donkeys, hides, amomum seeds, red peppers, and many other valuable dyes, spices, oils, timber, drugs, skins, and farinaceous foods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""Liverpool's Interest in West Africa"", 'section_title': '', 'content': ""On Friday, Oct. 18, the representatives in the lately elected House of Commons for the City of Liverpool, were entertained at luncheon by the members of the Chamber of Commerce.

Sierra Leone has belonged to Great Britain for over eighty years, and is the most considerable of these colonies, and the centre of government of the whole Coast. Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos were in 1866 placed under the Governor of Sierra Leone, much against their wishes and their interests, and it is the government and welfare of these three smaller possessions which have been the most neglected. For nearly 300 years English merchants have been trading in Gambia, which is the nearest colony to the mother country. The annual imports during the last ten years have averaged 127,000l., and the exports 155,000l. The annual revenue is raised by import and export duties, and amounts to 18,000l., out of which sum over 6,000l. is paid in salaries to the Governor and about 25 civil officers appointed by the Colonial-office. The principal grievance of the merchants resident there is that the Imperial Government appoints all the officers, taxes them heavily to pay the official salaries, and affords no protection whatever against the surrounding native tribes. There is a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, but only one merchant is a member, whose presence is tantamount to being useless when opposed to the opinions of the Government officials. The Gambia merchants complain that in 1870, after attempting to dispose of this colony, the Imperial Government withdrew all the troops, and ever since they have been denuded of all means of defending themselves; and although the Home Government has been appealed to for help, not even a gunboat has visited the colony during the last 16 months, and the colony itself has been compelled lately to arrange for the purchase of a small armed steamer to run up and down the river. Serious disturbances have recently broken out among the natives on British territory, and the natives having threatened an attack upon Bathurst—the seat of the Government—this colony has been compelled to obtain aid from the French Government, and to get their town garrisoned by French troops, and the harbour protected by a French war vessel.\n\nThe colonists also complain that they have now no direct mail communication with this country, and that they are compelled to contribute 1,000l. per annum towards the useless maintenance of a small steamer running once a month to Sierra Leone, 500 miles further down the Coast.

In former times sufficient attention was not always given by the authorities to the suitability of candidates for employment in the minor posts in these then much despised West African possessions. But all this has greatly changed. The growing importance of the West African trade, and the general éclaircissement which followed the operations of the Ashanti War, have brought about a different spirit in the administration of these colonies, and the present colonial service in West Africa is not inferior to any other branch of the service in other parts of the world, and of late has furnished a considerable proportion of remarkable men who have distinguished themselves on the West Coast of Africa, and have been raised to posts of great influence and distinction elsewhere. I think, however, that decidedly more might be done to encourage such work as I have referred to in Lagos, namely, a thorough and scientific examination of the natural history and ethnology of these lands, so that we can be better guided in our administration of them, both by increasing our knowledge of their natural resources and by becoming more acquainted with the character of the races whom we are to rule. Especially should the learning of native languages be fostered among colonial officers. This movement has been already begun on the Gold Coast by Sir Brandford Griffith, and in Lagos by Captain Moloney, but I do not think any official steps have been taken in the matter. In nearly all the great divisions of Africa there is some lingua Franca—some widespread language of general use among native traders, or the ruling caste, which would be understood everywhere, from Benin to Old Calabar, and up the Niger to its confluence with the Benue; the Yoruba tongue, which is prevalent throughout Logos colony and right away to the kingdom of Nupe; the Hausa language, which is a good deal spoken in the Gold Coast colony, and which is one of the leading tongues of the Niger basin; the Mandingo, which is widely spread as a commercial language over the Sierra Leone colony; and the Wolof, which is much spoken on the Gambia. In the learning of each one of these languages in their respective spheres of influence colonial officers should be encouraged by small bounties or some palpable reward.

With the missionaries it can be imagined how these ruffians came in conflict; and so angry were they at the prospect of the missionaries protecting their victims, or interfering with them, that they bribed and frightened the native chiefs, and used every effort to prevent the missionaries obtaining any hold on the country. The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

These treaties took two forms - those between Africans and Europeans, and bilateral agreements between the Europeans themselves. The African-European treaties were basically of two kinds. Firstly, there were the slave trade and the commercial treaties; these had generated friction, which in turn led to European political interference in African affairs. Secondly, there were the political treaties by which African rulers either purportedly surrendered sovereignty in return for protection, or undertook not to enter into treaty obligations with other European nations.\nThese political treaties were in vogue during our period. They were made either by representatives of European governments or by those of private organizations who later transferred them to their respective govern› ments. If a metropolitan government accepted them, the territories in question were usually annexed or declared a protectorate; if, on the other hand, it suspected their authenticity, or if it felt constrained by the vicissi› tudes of Weltpolitik to exercise caution, these treaties were used for bargaining purposes during the bilateral European negotiations. Africans, on the other hand, entered into these arrangements for a variety of motives, but particularly because of the interests of their people. In some cases, they desired treaty relations with Europeans because they hoped that the prestige of such a relationship would endow them with certain political advantages in dealing with their neighbours. Sometimes a weak African state would desire a treaty with a European power in the hope of using it to renounce allegiance to another African state that claimed sovereignty over it. An African sovereign would also desire a treaty in the hope of using it to keep recalcitrant subject states in line. And sometimes a treaty with one European nation was seen by some African states as a means of preserving their independence which was being threatened by other European nations.$^{42}$ Whatever was the case, the African-European political treaties played an important role in the final partition of Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Niger delta > The eastern delta', 'content': ""The decision to abolish the slave trade by Britain in 1807 was an important factor for change. Efforts to effect stoppage of the trade led to new activities by British traders, consuls, and naval officers, resulting in new relationships with the delta states. First, it led to an increased British presence in the Bight of Bonny. For example, in 1827 a naval squadron was stationed at Fernando Po, and in 1849,$^{ tne}$ & $^{TSt}$ British consul, John Beecroft, was appointed for the entire territories of the Bights of Benin and Bonny. The Court of Mixed Commissions was also set up at Freetown, Sierra Leone, to try the captains of captured slave ships, and to set free the slaves of condemned slavers. For the delta states, these developments meant the demonstration of British power in their waters, bringing the era of gunboat diplomacy in which the British consuls used naval power to negotiate favourable conditions for British traders, missionaries, and explorers. In practice, the consuls, especially after 1850, continued and stepped up a policy started in the 1830s by Edward Nicolls, Governor of Fernando Po, of signing treaties with the local chiefs.$^{6}$ These treaties stipulated the stoppage of the slave trade by the rulers; the adoption of 'legitimate trade', that is, trade in goods other than slaves; laid down regulations for the conduct of legitimate trade; specified the sums of customs duties or comey to be paid by the traders, as well as subsidies that the British government was to pay the local rulers for their agreement to give up the slave trade.\nThese British activities on the coast gradually eroded the power of the local rulers, especially when the consuls and naval officers assisted the British traders to set up their own judicial systems over and above the law of the local states, the so-called Courts of Equity, composed mainly of British traders with the participation of a few local House Heads or chiefs.

This, of course, would not be tolerated in that age, and using the killing of the British acting consul-general and five other Englishmen on their way to Benin as an excuse, the British launched a punitive expedition of 1500 men against Benin in 1897. Though the Oba himself would have liked to submit, a majority of his chiefs raised an army to beat back the invasion. They were, however, defeated and the capital was looted of its precious bronze treasures and then burnt. 48 In the Niger Delta, as in many other areas of Nigeria, the British had signed treaties of protection with most of the chiefs by 1884. However, while some, like Calabar and Bonny, had allowed missionaries to operate in their states, others had not. Moreover, all of them were insisting on their sovereign rights to regulate trade and to levy duties on British traders. This, the new British consuls, such as Hewett and Johnston, would not tolerate. A typical example of the rulers who stood up to the British consuls and missionaries was Jaja of Opobo (see Plate 6.3). He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order. When Jaja still refused to comply in spite of Johnston's threats to bombard his town with British gunboats, Johnston enticed Jaja on board a ship in 1887 under a promise of safeconduct but arrested him and sent him to Accra$^{49}$ where he was tried and deported to the West Indies.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858.

There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners.

In September 1931 the Colonial Office dispatched a circular to officers administering depen› dencies asking them to help Britain and reminding them that: the interests of the United Kingdom and those of the Colonies and Dependencies are inseparably bound up with one another, that the perils which face the United Kingdom are perils which menace the whole Empire ... that any general collapse of British credit and declir - in the exchange value of sterling must spell ruin for the colonies no less than for the United Kingdom. 83 Despite the higher tariff on non-British goods, their importation, to the advantage of consumers in the dependencies, increased greatly. Canvas shoes and artificial silk and cotton clothing, all from Japan, featured promi› nently, and their prices were far below those of British goods which enjoyed protection. In 1934 the district officer of Dar es Salaam, Tanganyika, observed that 'practically every shop in the district'$^{84}$ was stocked with many Japanese goods. The development was especially important during this period of economic distress. As one colonial administrator in Tangan› yika put it, probably with some exaggeration, 'the average African would now be reduced to wearing bark cloth if it were not for the fact that large quantities of cheap cotton goods from Japanese manufacture are exposed for sale in all the town and country shops'.$^{85}$ But the British Government's concern was the success of the British industry and not the welfare of the poor people in the dependencies. In 1934 a further attack was made on non-British goods by raising the tariff to 100%, as a general rule. In addition, a quota system was imposed on the importation of Japanese textiles. There were isolated protests against these measures but the colon› ized people had to pay high prices, thereby promoting imperialist interests at their own expense."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Marketing', 'content': ""Certainly, until the early 1930s, the tendency was to encourage whoever was likely to contribute in this respect. Thus Indian traders were not only allowed, but, to some extent, were also encouraged to patronize trade in East Africa, and to some extent in Central Africa. The Asian population in East Africa increased as follows: Uganda: 1910 - 2000; 1917 - 13026; Tanganyika: 1913 - 18784; 1931 - 23422; Kenya: 1921 - 22800; 1931 26759. The 'dislike and distrust of the Levantine communities' in West Africa, which Professor Bauer noticed to be 'marked in official circles', 71 was a relatively recent development. Real hostility towards the Levantines, mostly Lebanese, came not from official circles but from the various European agents of commercial firms, and such hostility was in response to effective trade rivalry presented by the Levantines.$^{72}$ And where British firms appear to have been given preference, it was not because of their respectability, but because they could - with the blessing of the British government - act as effective pressure groups and influence colonial policy› makers. 73 Still, Ehrlich's generalization that 'administrative attitudes, throughout British Africa, rarely encouraged indigenous commercial initiative'$^{74}$ is quite valid. But other factors stifled local initiatives. First of all, general official policy, as would be expected in a colonial situation, was geared primarily towards the advancement of imperialist interests. Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction. By the first decade of the twentieth century, following the construction of railways, European firms were squeezing African traders in two related ways. Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

As European nations increasingly became interested in the acquisition of African territories, the missionaries paved the way in some areas of Africa and served, quite consciously, as agents for European colonialism. Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': 'The slave trade and incorporation into the capitalist world economy', 'content': ""The impact ofthe slave-traders on the political fortunes ofthe indigenous aristocracy was not uniform. In some cases the dominant class emerged stronger as a result of economic and military ties to the slave-traders. Consider relations between the Bemba rulers and the Arab and Swahili traders. Under the leadership of Chileshe Chipela the Bemba had just completed a phase of territorial expansion and political centralization when the foreign traders entered their homeland around i860. As a result, the Bemba kingdom was far more unified and powerful than most states in the region. The geographical position of the Bemba, somewhat removed from the principal trade routes, precluded the growth of a large and potentially seditious merchant community within the core of their kingdom. Equally important, there was no incentive for the Arab and Swahili traders to adopt a hostile posture since the Bemba were not economic rivals. Most of the royal families' wealth came from raiding and tribute in the form of ivory and slaves and they were happy to exchange them for the cloth and other imported goods provided by the coastal merchants. This economic complementarity fostered a harmonious relationship and simultaneously enhanced the internal position of the Bemba aristocracy, which used the foreign commodities to recruit new followers and strengthen their links to subordinate chiefs. The continued demand for captives and ivory also fuelled a new expansionist phase from i860 to 1880, during which Bemba forces conquered most of contemporary north-eastern Zambia. Thus, through ties to foreign merchants, the Bemba rulers gained unprecedented regional power while accumulating a substantial amount of wealth. 43 As in the case of the Bemba, other local chiefs and merchants entered into alliances with the slave-traders that proved extremely beneficial. Throughout the 1870s the Chewa chief, Mwase Kasungu, whose territory straddled the Lake Malawi-Katanga trade route, provided food for the Arab caravans in exchange for guns. These weapons enabled him to withstand the subsequent Mbwela Nguni invasions.$^{44}$ Economic con› siderations also motivated Arab and Swahili protection of the Senga chiefs, who were important suppliers of ivory.$^{45}$ Similar factors help explain Chikunda alliances with the Ambo against the Bemba, and assistance that they provided the Nsenga against the Soli, which occurred in the decade preceding the 'Scramble'.$^{46}$ In all these cases, it is clear that the aliens' strategy was to prevent"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 322, 'article_title': 'General Observations', 'full_section_title': 'General Observations', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1864#article-10', 'issue_date': '23_02_1864', 'content': ""We are informed from Cape Coast that roads (native—i.e., paths through the bush) are being made in various parts of the Protected Territories, and that **the highway from Cape Coast to the Prah** (frontier of Ashantee) **is now opened.**\n\nIt will be seen by our Accra letters that bullock-carts are now employed on that section of the Aquapem road that has been completed, with so much praiseworthy exertion, by the Basle missionaries.\n\nCaptain Burton arrived at Abomey or Agbome, on his visit to the King of Dahomey, on the 20th December, and expects to remain there until the end of February, at which time the King and his army will leave on another war expedition—said to be against Abeokuta.\n\nWe are informed that so far from the trade in all the oil rivers being at an entire standstill, as was represented by the telegrams sent to the daily press on the arrival of the mail, two ships of the Company of African Merchants had loaded two cargoes in the short space of a few weeks; and that they have sailed from the Coast for England.

Allusion was therein made to the annexations by France and Germany of certain places adjacent to the Gold and Slave Coast Settlements, where British trade had previously been firmly established. It was therein shown how desirable it would be to have an unbroken line of coast under the British Protectorate, instead of scattered settlements, chiefly because the principles of trading adopted by other European Powers differed from our own, and frequently led to a conflict of interests, resulting in loss of trade to British merchants and of revenue to the Colonial Governments. This Chamber then suggested that it might be possible to arrange an exchange of places with France and Germany, which would diminish or altogether abolish unequal competition in the same markets, and your memorialists believe that such negotiations might still be entered upon with advantage. Your memorialists think it almost superfluous to remind your lordship that, whilst the Government of this country, throughout all its possessions, affords to foreigners the same facilities for trade as are enjoyed by British subjects, other European Powers, both in their home and foreign possessions, impose conditions adverse to all but their own subjects. This fact furnishes the principal ground of the alarm created by the alleged action of a French officer at Abeokuta. Your lordship has probably been made aware, by the communications received from the Governor of Lagos, that a French agent from Porto Novo, a French possession near the settlement of Lagos, with the same background for trade which adds so much to the value of Lagos, has visited Abeokuta, making there a treaty with the King and chiefs of the Egbas. It is stated that both money and goods have been promised on condition that the ""rights and privileges of government be ceded to the French;"" that slavery is to be tolerated; and that, in fact, it is practically agreed that France may proclaim a protectorate over the country, thereby gaining the commerce which the subjects of this country have created, and undoing the good for which this State, assisted by its missionaries, has laboured. Your memorialists complain that after all they have achieved by their intercourse with the natives in the prosecution of trade—viz., after having developed the demand for European goods and made trading safe and profitable—that after having, in fact, pursued those methods which alone make African settlements worth holding, they should now be deprived of the benefits thus won by the alleged selfish and encroaching policy of a foreign Government. Your lordship is no doubt aware that Abeokuta is forty or fifty miles behind the settlement of Lagos; that it is most directly approached from the coast by road and river from that place; that it is on the highway to the Yoruba country and to other districts beyond; that it is an up-country emporium; that a valuable proportion of the trade of Lagos, inward and outward, passes through it; and that the loss of that trade by means of a French Custom House being interposed between Lagos and Abeokuta would render the possession of Lagos itself of much less importance. Your memorialists would remind your lordship that the method of British trading with Africa has been undergoing a change; that instead of proceeding from isolated factories or groups of factories, trade is now being carried on by the natives themselves; that in many instances they come to England to be educated, and return to their own country with sympathy for civilised life, and competent to conduct business with English houses; that this system is greatly on the increase, tending to make tropical African settlements permanent and valuable additions to the British Empire. Your memorialists would, therefore, urge your lordship generally to encourage the kings and chiefs of districts adjoining British possessions to make treaties with Her Majesty\'s Government, whereby British trade...\n'}, {'id': 6088, 'article_title': 'Trouble on the Gambia', 'full_section_title': 'Trouble on the Gambia', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_05_1891#article-1', 'issue_date': '04_05_1891', 'content': ""The British & African Steam Navigation Company's Royal mail steamer Sherbro' left Bathurst on the 18th of March, at which time her Majesty's ships Alecto, Swallow, and another had returned from their expedition against a powerful ruler up the Gambia River.

The mission of these Envoys marks a stage in a series of negotiations. They are six in number, the chief amongst them being Prince A. A. Ossoo-Ansah, a son of Prince Ansah, who, in 1874, after the Ashanti War and the deposition of King Coffee, visited England for the purpose of clearing himself of imputations as to disloyalty to England during that war, and of obtaining compensation for the destruction of his property by the enemy. Prince Ossoo Ansah is the only one of the six who can speak English, and is appointed to act as interpreter and spokesman. The purpose of the visit has been stated in telegraphic despatches, but some fuller information is now available. It seems that the relations of Great Britain towards Ashanti have, with the sanction of the French Government, assumed somewhat new features, as it has been recognised as falling within the British sphere of influence. With the increased assurance of protection thus afforded, British traders have extended their operations in the country, which is extremely fertile in general produce, and especially rich in gold. The Governor of Cape Coast Castle, Sir W. Brandford Griffith, has consequently been led to propose the extension of British authority in a more formal manner—the establishment of a British Resident at the capital, Coomassie (or Kumasi).

The British protectorate, as you are aware, is extended over a large portion of the Coast of Africa, which stretches from the settlement of Sierra Leone to the district of the Niger. Upon this coast, excluding the State of Liberia and the neighbourhood of Whydah, the port of Dahomey, there are three French settlements—viz., Grand Bassam, Assinie, and Porto Novo; also portions of coast unprotected by any European Power. West of Grand Bassam there is unoccupied coast of considerable extent; east of Lagos, beyond Leckie, and reaching to Old Calabar, there is the important territory at the mouths of the Niger. Quite recently the Germans have taken certain ports on this coast—viz., Ahgweh, Bageida, and Little Popo. At these there was a thriving and increasing British trade, and with the chiefs of Ahgweh and Little Popo treaties had been made on behalf of Her Majesty, securing the right of British subjects to trade on equal terms with those of any other nation. The occupation by France and the late annexations by Germany break the continuity of the British protectorate; there is an increasing conflict of the various national interests, and the influence of the British authorities with the natives is being lessened; the introduction of different principles of trading will also seriously affect the prosperity of British commerce. It is important to mention in this connexion that the duties upon spirits, arms, and ammunition levied in the British settlements furnish the greater portion of the Government revenue. In German and French settlements these articles are known, in most cases, to be free of duty, and being sold to a great extent in the same markets as the British imports, competition becomes difficult, and the loss to the British revenue and trade must ultimately be great. The Chamber would suggest, therefore, that while negotiations regarding African territories are pending, something might be done in the way of exchange or by mutual concession to induce Germany, at least, to withdraw from those newly acquired ports where British trade had become established, and where German rivalry upon different principles is likely to be so injurious. This Government might also be requested to take into consideration the question of the extension of the British protectorate to the unprotected portion of the coast named.—I am, &c.,\n\n""C. B.

F. Hutton, President of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, in his address at the annual meeting of the Chamber on Feb. 1, said that a matter which had engaged the attention of the directors was our trade with West Africa, particularly in the neighbourhood of the rivers Niger and Binue. They had to complain very much of the apathy manifested by the resident officials of Her Majesty's Government, who taxed the goods, but declined to afford any protection or assistance to British merchants. Those officials seemed to have an idea that they were sent out to rule and not to assist as much as possible in the development of British trade. Owing to the state of affairs which had been allowed to arise in the localities indicated, the trade in this country had suffered a very marked decline, for whereas in 1884 we sent 106,000,000 yards of cotton goods, representing a value of £1,320,000, we only sent last year 73,000,000 yards, or a money value of £851,000. He submitted that the Government ought to take prompt measures to protect the lives and property of British subjects in West Africa, and so assist in extending a very valuable market for English manufactures. They had just heard that last May, on the invitation of the German Government, Her Majesty's Government gave to Germany an assurance that a Congo International Conference should be pledged to the British Protectorate in the Niger, that only moderate duties should be levied, and that those should only be levied for the purpose of paying the expenses necessary to carry out the obligations of the Protectorate. At the same time it was understood that there should be no monopolies there, and those concessions were made without giving those who were really owners of property in the territories any voice in the country whatever. Two of the special objects of the merchants in obtaining these concessions from the natives and in obtaining the treaties of sovereignty and territory were that we should do the very utmost we could to stop the importation of spirits into the districts. That trade had increased very considerably during the last few years, and it was one of the curses which European countries were introducing into uncivilized countries, and would tend to retard the progress of our trade and the progress of civilization in the interior of Africa. He thought it was a discredit almost to the Powers of Europe that when great and earnest endeavours were made to limit the import of spirits into these places, there was an almost unanimous opinion expressed against it except by England. Another object which these merchants had in making these treaties was that there should also be some limit put upon the importation of arms and gunpowder, which was another source of evil, and constantly causing wars and raids on our trade."", 'last_edit_date': '1886-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1886#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.698, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH AUTHORITY AND COMMERCE IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The African Trade Section of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce recently presented to the members of the Chamber the draft of a memorial to the Foreign Office respecting the extension of the British protectorate on the coast of Guinea.

The Committee recommended that the Chamber should ask the Foreign Office that while negotiations regarding African territories were pending, something might be done, by exchange or otherwise, to induce Germany, at least, to withdraw from the ports where British trade had become established, and where rivalry upon different commercial and political principles was so injurious. The Government might also take into consideration the extension of the British protectorate to the unoccupied portions of the coast alluded to. It was moved that the Chamber should forward to the Foreign Office a memorial on the lines of that submitted by the African Trade Section. This resolution was unanimously agreed to. At the same meeting a letter was read which had been received from the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, asking the Liverpool Chamber to join in a petition to Lord Granville respecting the claims of Portugal on the Congo. The petition stated that authentic information had been received that Portugal was again bringing forward its former pretensions to hold and exercise authority over both banks of the Congo and the adjacent territories, and pointed out the necessity of immediate and effectual steps being taken to secure the renunciation, on the part of Portugal, of any attempt to interfere with the rights of British traders and with the jurisdiction on either side of the Congo and on the adjacent territory. Ultimately it was agreed that the Liverpool Chamber should join with the Manchester Chamber in their petition.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Two events of the past month are likely to have a lasting influence upon the future of Africa.

I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain. If we gave away the Gold Coasts or Lagos, or the Niger, for instance, in exchange for concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or the North Atlantic, the ratio of loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be far greater than the gain to the Australians or the Newfoundlanders. To those who argue that our missionaries and merchants might go on working in West Africa just the same, even if the rule in our possession were transferred to another Power, I would ask, \'How many British merchants are there in French Senegambia? What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value. Then as to Zanzibar and British East Africa, they, in their turn, besides securing the southern approach to the dominions of our Egyptian ward, are a necessity to the trade and overflow emigration of our great Indian Empire, with its nearly 300,000,000 of people and its yearly trade with the British Empire of some £90,000,000. The trade of the British Empire with British Africa amounts to about £25,200,000 yearly. Among the more valuable products which British Africa sends us, or supplies to herself, may be cited the following: gold, silver, copper, coal, diamonds, ivory, rubber, palm oil, palm kernels, gums, cotton, dyewoods, indigo, coffee, sugar, rice, Indian corn, horses, cattle, donkeys, hides, amomum seeds, red peppers, and many other valuable dyes, spices, oils, timber, drugs, skins, and farinaceous foods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.711, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Upon another page our readers will find the text of a letter which has been addressed by the members of the African Trade Section of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce to Lord Salisbury, as Foreign Secretary, upon the subject of the boundaries of the territories of the Royal Niger Company in the Oil Rivers Districts. As is perhaps only natural, the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce strongly protested against the extension of the authority of the Royal Niger Company over any portion of the Oil Rivers, and they point out that only two years ago the grant of a Royal Charter was refused to this very district. No doubt the presence of a large trading company, endued with special and exceptional powers, has a tendency to dwarf other commercial undertakings in the same district. But the Government are necessarily swayed by broader considerations than the advantage or disadvantage of certain individual traders. Their chief object is to provide for the administration of the particular district. The existence of chartered companies is only tolerable in uncivilised or semi-civilised countries, where the presence of a strong commercial interest may often enable the governing body to provide for the administration of the district without the great expense that would have to be incurred by the home Government if they attempted the direct administration themselves. The history of the development of India under the fostering rule of the Honourable East India Company proves the correctness of this theory, and to her Majesty's ministers it appears that the Royal Niger Company occupies an analogous position in its own district. The charter which was granted to the Niger Company some years ago is sufficiently careful in safeguarding the interests of others, and the success which has attended its administration of the district in question appears fully to justify an extension of its authority in the direction of the Oil Rivers. Surely the great desideratum is the civilisation and improvement of the long neglected races on the West Coast of Africa, to whom Great Britain owes so vast a debt, and so long as that is accomplished it matters little whether it be effected by a commercial corporation endued with exceptional powers, or be left to be gradually evolved as the result of individual effort—except that in the latter case it will take a much longer time to produce the result aimed at."", 'last_edit_date': '1892-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1892#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.698, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'A New African Market for English Manufactures', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. George Baden-Powell recently addressed a letter on this subject to a contemporary, from which we extract the following: Europeans in the middle ages appropriated all it could of America, Africa, and Asia under the pretext of the conversion of the heathen.

Now the Germans on the east and Internationalists on the west are doing their best to open up the interior of Africa to English manufactures. But Englishmen should not forget that on the south the English taxpayer has recently paid for the opening out of a trade route which is capable of tapping all Africa below 10deg. south latitude—a vast district rich in ivory, and probably in gold also, and containing a large population which is rapidly placing a value on English manufactures. Sir Charles Warren has opened up a good road, with watering places and telegraph all along, so far as Shoshong, which is situated at 22deg. south; the whole way lies on a healthy table-land, three to five thousand feet above the sea-level, and connecting at Kimberley with a railway system in direct communication with the Cape Town docks.

England had extended to her West African dependencies the privileges of British legitimate trade and commerce, which was a powerful vehicle for the advancement of civilisation.\n\nBringing forward the commercial advancement of the West African Colonies, he said the question had often been asked, ""Do the Colonies pay?"" He could answer with an emphatic affirmative. In 1837 the total external trade of England with all the Colonies was £28,341,471; it was now nearly £300,000,000, thus showing an increase of about ten times. The British shipping in connexion with the Colonies in 1837 was 3,677,975 tons; in 1885 it was 56,611,075 tons. The English Customs returns reckoned the exports to the Colonies in 1837 at £11,283,363; and this had since risen to £54,545,553. Her Majesty\'s Colonies, he said, furnished more than a quarter of the whole world\'s annual supply of gold. He then referred to the commercial geography of the British African Colonies, gave the value of their exports and imports, and reviewed the trade generally. The construction of a railway to the interior of Africa from Lagos was a recent proposition and a new feature in the history of the West African Colonies. It was obvious that Africa was, or would be, the only continent open for the future expansion of British manufacture; in such a case the interior would play an important part. He maintained, with eminent authorities on the subject, that by native agency alone, under foreign supervision necessarily, could tropical Africa be gradually and definitely developed on any permanent basis, and that the negro should be educated industrially and otherwise with the generous help of Europe and America. Whatever was accomplished by native agency, England certainly should carry the credit of effecting such accomplishment in the civilisation of Africa. It was beyond doubt that the English were acknowledged the best colonisers; and the marked consideration invariably shown by them to the people whom they undertook to govern, the extreme liberty and entire privileges of a British subject extended to every native, and the judicious caution characteristic of the policy of the British Government had altogether won for England this success and the preference to all other civilised nations.

Rather more than two years ago, an agreement was concluded at Paris between our Government and that of France with regard to the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence in West Africa. The territories referred to in the agreement were Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast. It was provided that the two Governments should have the right of appointing special Commissions of Delimitation ""to trace upon the spot, wherever they may consider it necessary, the line of demarcation between the English and French possessions"" in conformity with the agreement. The work of determining the boundary line between Senegambia and Sierra Leone is now about to be begun, the British Commissioners having left Liverpool on Saturday last. For some time past British merchants interested in commerce with Sierra Leone have been apprehensive that their trade with the interior might be seriously interfered with, if not absolutely ruined, by a wrongful definition of the boundary.

At present, the three weeks taken by even the fastest postal communication is a serious drawback to the commerce of Lagos, Sierra Leone, and the other West African ports, and the proposed cable will do much to simplify and develop commercial relations between Great Britain and the ports and towns in her West Coast possessions. Further south, we have the still more important district of the Congo. Mr. H. M. Stanley, than whom no greater authority upon the subject exists, seems never to tire of pointing out the advantages which must result from the formation of new markets in the Congo territory; and the decision of the European Powers at the Berlin Conference that Free Trade principles should be established at least for a term of years in the territory of the African International Association will do much towards the development of trade with parts not hitherto reached by commerce.

No payment will be made for goodwill, the shareholders in that Company being satisfied that they will make a larger profit by becoming interested in a more powerfully-constituted undertaking. This agreement will provide the new Company at once with a favourable basis for its operations, and enable it to enter immediately upon a profitable business in the Lower Congo district, and give great facilities for opening up trade as communications with the Upper Congo are established.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

Besides illegal slavery, there was extensively practised in Africa a system of native despotism which it was very desirable should be abolished. In 1876 nobody seemed to take any notice of Africa, and the exportation of India-rubber from Zanzibar amounted to something under £20,000. Now the amount was about £250,000! With respect to ill-health in that continent, he had found that some of the native treatments were by no means to be despised, and many of our English doctors could take a leaf out of their book. The record of men who had travelled through Africa and endured every conceivable kind of hardship proved that Africa had been cursed by the idea of its unhealthiness, a reproach which it did not deserve. The great thing required, however, was adequate communication. African travelling, under present circumstances, meant, at the outside, fifty miles in a week. At the present time every mile of railroad laid down in Africa drove a dozen nails into the coffin of the slave-trade, to say nothing of the immense impetus to trade and commerce which would thus be afforded. From Cairo right away to the Albert Nyanza was navigable water. There would be no difficulty in overcoming the obstacles of cataracts, &c., which modern engineering would easily surmount. The central high plateau of Africa was, to a great extent, in British hands, and offered the most important means of repressing the slave-trade in future. Every slave working at the present time was in direct defiance of the Act of 1873. Mr. Rhodes\' great railway, which would reach Zambesia within eight years, should be kept under British control, as native treaties were more or less uncertain. In 1876 they could have obtained all that is now German territory by holding up their hands. The Germans, however, are practically locked in. A dispute had been going on with Portugal as to whether the Zambesi was an open highway. Fortunately, owing to the twenty-one miles strip of land granted by England to Germany these two powers would be as one on the question, and in future arbitration claim the Zambesi as an open highway. A wise system of emigration should be conducted. He would like to see Indian planters transferred there, and Chinese too. Africa offered an excellent opening for the English working man, and it was desirable that the Government should protect its emigrants.

Canvas shoes and artificial silk and cotton clothing, all from Japan, featured promi› nently, and their prices were far below those of British goods which enjoyed protection. In 1934 the district officer of Dar es Salaam, Tanganyika, observed that 'practically every shop in the district'$^{84}$ was stocked with many Japanese goods. The development was especially important during this period of economic distress. As one colonial administrator in Tangan› yika put it, probably with some exaggeration, 'the average African would now be reduced to wearing bark cloth if it were not for the fact that large quantities of cheap cotton goods from Japanese manufacture are exposed for sale in all the town and country shops'.$^{85}$ But the British Government's concern was the success of the British industry and not the welfare of the poor people in the dependencies. In 1934 a further attack was made on non-British goods by raising the tariff to 100%, as a general rule. In addition, a quota system was imposed on the importation of Japanese textiles. There were isolated protests against these measures but the colon› ized people had to pay high prices, thereby promoting imperialist interests at their own expense."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: North Africa', 'section_title': 'Part II: Libya, Egypt and the Sudan > The Sudan > The impact of British colonial economic activities on the Sudan', 'content': 'Compared with those of the French and the Italians in the Maghrib and Tripoli respectively, British colonial economic activities in the Sudan were laudable to some extent.

First, the infrastructure that was provided was totally inadequate and was clearly meant to promote the interests of Britain more than those of the Sudanese. It is most significant that not one single mile of motor road was constructed in the whole of the Sudan during the period under review while the railway was constructed initially to facilitate British military campaigns and later to promote their cotton and gum projects in Djazïra and the western areas respectively.

African labour and taxes kept the railways viable and maintained colonial revenues. Yet, the African masses suffered most from the cutback on already skimpy social services, such as medicine and education, and they had to pay more for these services. In the years of recovery after 1934, wages, prices and facilities for Africans remained retrenched in contrast to the return to high profit levels for private capital.\nColonial governments granted minimum relief to Africans suffering from the depression. They suspended tax collection, and they subsidised prices, as the French did for groundnuts. They also tried to moderate the crudest forms of middleman exploitation. These measures arose out of necessity, since no money was circulating and since lower prices in one country forced desperate peasants to march long distances and smuggle their produce out through an area where there was some marginal advantage. As far as the middlemen were concerned, the governments needed to restrain them from cornering the reduced profit rather than let it be exported. However, in East Africa the 'Asian' merchants were essential for keeping the money economy intact and avoiding reversion to barter, just as their capital had been the original basis for the extension of specie and small-scale money exchanges throughout the region.$^{16}$ In the final analysis, therefore, the British administration co-operated to protect the interests of these retailers and produce buyers.

They refused. He fined them $40 each. They refused to pay. He and his men attacked one of the traders with their cutlasses and nearly cut his arm off; the rest took their guns and prepared to fight. The Prince, a mere boy, then went off to another town to get more men. The traders sent off to Bassi—a port near by—to the representative of one of the merchants. He at once armed all the people there, and sent them overland to Changally, while he went by water. They arrived in time. When the Prince and his scamps returned they surrounded them, told them they were prisoners, that no harm would be done to them, but they would have to remain under guard until the King was communicated with. A messenger was sent by the agent to report to the King.

Hutton, President of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, in his address at the annual meeting of the Chamber on Feb. 1, said that a matter which had engaged the attention of the directors was our trade with West Africa, particularly in the neighbourhood of the rivers Niger and Binue. They had to complain very much of the apathy manifested by the resident officials of Her Majesty's Government, who taxed the goods, but declined to afford any protection or assistance to British merchants. Those officials seemed to have an idea that they were sent out to rule and not to assist as much as possible in the development of British trade. Owing to the state of affairs which had been allowed to arise in the localities indicated, the trade in this country had suffered a very marked decline, for whereas in 1884 we sent 106,000,000 yards of cotton goods, representing a value of £1,320,000, we only sent last year 73,000,000 yards, or a money value of £851,000. He submitted that the Government ought to take prompt measures to protect the lives and property of British subjects in West Africa, and so assist in extending a very valuable market for English manufactures. They had just heard that last May, on the invitation of the German Government, Her Majesty's Government gave to Germany an assurance that a Congo International Conference should be pledged to the British Protectorate in the Niger, that only moderate duties should be levied, and that those should only be levied for the purpose of paying the expenses necessary to carry out the obligations of the Protectorate. At the same time it was understood that there should be no monopolies there, and those concessions were made without giving those who were really owners of property in the territories any voice in the country whatever. Two of the special objects of the merchants in obtaining these concessions from the natives and in obtaining the treaties of sovereignty and territory were that we should do the very utmost we could to stop the importation of spirits into the districts. That trade had increased very considerably during the last few years, and it was one of the curses which European countries were introducing into uncivilized countries, and would tend to retard the progress of our trade and the progress of civilization in the interior of Africa. He thought it was a discredit almost to the Powers of Europe that when great and earnest endeavours were made to limit the import of spirits into these places, there was an almost unanimous opinion expressed against it except by England. Another object which these merchants had in making these treaties was that there should also be some limit put upon the importation of arms and gunpowder, which was another source of evil, and constantly causing wars and raids on our trade."", 'last_edit_date': '1886-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1886#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.711, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'NAVIGATION OF THE RIVER NIGER.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The above paragraph follows immediately the statement that ""promises have been made to those chiefs [in the Niger] that trading ports should be established in their territories.""

It may be confidently affirmed that, but for the patriotic and courageous action of that Company, the Lower and Middle Niger would have passed into the hands of France, which now holds the Upper Niger; while the Benue and Chad Basin would have fallen to the lot of Germany. The efforts still being made by France to extend southward and eastward from Senegambia, point to the conclusion that, but for the Niger Company, British influence would have been for ever excluded from Western Africa, with the exception of the narrow strips of coast line which form our British Colonies and which depend necessarily for their development on those inner regions which would have passed into the hands of foreign powers.\n\nMr. Thomson points out that this struggle, which extended over several years, and in which the Niger Company—then known as the National African Company—risked its existence, was entirely unsupported by the British Government, and would probably have never received any recognition but for necessities resulting from the Berlin Conference. We must, however, demur to Mr. Thomson\'s view that Downing Street is responsible for the apathy displayed up to a recent date in developing the British West African Colonies, and in securing for England her share of the African Continent. Downing Street, after all, is the servant and not the master of public opinion, which it can, indeed, do much to lead, but which it cannot compel to follow. It seems to us that Downing Street has shown its capacity by seizing on the bound this outburst of popular enthusiasm for the benefit of the empire and of civilisation.\n\nMr. Thomson has based his arguments on the record of the Niger Company—because, having been the longest established, it has had time to plant its stations in the heart of Africa, and to establish British ""political and commercial supremacy over the entire Central Soudan;"" but he refers also ""to the Imperial British East Africa Company, whose first yearly report tells a tale of work and progress, of which they have a right to be proud,"" and he concludes his article with a strong opinion that ""in chartered companies alone is there hope for the development of British influence, commerce, and civilisation in Africa.""

""African Merchant"" himself must recognize that such retrogression is not practicable, for it would involve leaving the Niger region to the land-grabbing operations of foreigners with a colonization craze. The British Government wished to prevent a foreign protectorate, and they were glad to find persons prepared to save them trouble and expense. They jumped at the offer of the National African Company, and were not too particular about the effect of entrusting the taxing and administrative powers to a party of traders who might be tempted to handicap competitors to secure to themselves a practical monopoly. It is true that the Charter purports to preserve the rights of other traders, but due and licence charges are doing the monopolists\' work on the Niger. What Liverpool merchants ask is that the Charter shall be revoked, and the administrative powers conferred on a non-trading organization. In the present company the dual position of governors and traders is anomalous, and leaves the management open to suspicion. The quotation from the Foreign Office letter suggests that Lord Salisbury has misconceived the desires of independent merchants and traders. They do not wish to return to the old system, but to secure such arrangements as will prevent the trade of the Niger being injured for the benefit of a chartered and limited company. They have established a case for that inquiry which should have preceded the grant of a charter. The incubus is the more galling from the circumstance that authority is conferred on a new company, to the detriment of merchants engaged in the trade of the rivers forming the Niger delta. Before the Government adopted so important a step as chartering one set of traders, they should have obtained the views of merchants who know something of the region in question. So far, the agents of the company do not appear to have achieved any administrative triumphs; their capacity seems to be limited to providing fellow-traders with grievances and driving out of the river the smaller class of traders.

What are the facts? A company not long in existence has been granted sovereign rights and taxing powers over the imports and exports of from five to eight millions of people, and no company trading for its own benefit can exercise such powers in an impartial manner. Powers such as these can only be properly used by an independently-organized body, altogether unconnected with trade. Probably the Government having negotiated treaties with countries up the Niger, were glad to transfer their responsibility to the first who asked for it. Nominally there was to be no monopoly, but practically the greater number of traders are entirely debarred from doing business, and instead of there being free trade, open to all comers, the trade is absolutely shut up.

During the years 1879—82 two French companies entered the Niger. One of these, with a capital of £600,000, has extensive establishments on the Senegal coast, and is managed by gentlemen of very great African experience and of high intelligence. It has lately withdrawn entirely from the Niger-Binue, owing to the severity of the competition and to the difficulty of carrying on a successful business there. The other French company, with a capital of £120,000, has, for similar reasons, withdrawn one half of its capital and taken up the other half in shares in the great British company which has solved the problem of successful working in the heart of Africa; so that the trade of the Niger-Binue basin remains solely under British law and British management as formerly. Meanwhile British influence and the advance of British trade and missionaries into the interior have sensibly diminished, and will, ere long, destroy the slave trade and the use of slave caravans—the curse of Central Africa.\n\nSuch is the record of Great Britain in the Niger-Binue. The claims arising from first discovery may be set aside as unpractical; the enterprise, the risks, the loss of capital and life during the past half-century of British private individuals and firms in opening up the Niger-Binue to civilization, may be considered as without force in international law; the Christianising efforts of her missionaries may be disregarded; even the British Government exploring expeditions, so numerous and so costly in money and in life—the climate being then so little understood—and even the Parliamentary subsidies to trade, may be considered insufficient to establish British rights in the Niger-Binue. Great Britain has a more valid political claim than any of these. She alone has, since the discovery of these waters, taken upon herself the maintenance of order and the keeping open of these rivers to the trade of all nations; her Consuls alone have acted consistently and successfully as dispensers of justice not only between the traders, but between the native tribes themselves; her gunboats alone have policed the rivers and restrained evil-doers.

This term is in contradistinction to the Upper Niger, from Timbuctoo to the sources, which runs for a distance of 1,000 miles at the back of the French colony of Senegal, and which has been visited by several French exploring parties, though as yet no European trade has been opened there. Nor, indeed, can such trade be carried on profitably until the completion of the railway connecting the waterways of the Senegal and the Upper Niger. Between the latter and the Niger-Binue lies the long stretch of the Middle Niger, from Timbuctoo to Boussa; nature thus interposing a barrier of 800 miles between the Upper Niger basin, which will probably fall to France, and the Niger-Binue basin, which is already occupied by Great Britain. The Niger-Binue was unknown to Europe fifty-five years ago. The wildest theories were held as to the ultimate destination of the Niger—some geographers holding that it was absorbed by an inland sea, others that it fell into the Nile, others that it joined the Congo. The English traveller, John Lander, in 1831 solved the problem by starting from Badagry, and travelling northwards till he reached the Niger, near Boussa, where are the lowest rapids, and where commences the Niger-Binue system. He followed the river down 600 miles to the sea. Immediately on his return home, in 1832, his great discovery was turned to account by some Liverpool merchants, who despatched two steamers to nearly the highest navigable point on the Niger, and to Dagbo on the Binue. Numerous private expeditions from this country followed in the years 1834 to 1864, the most notable event being the formation in 1852 of the African Steamship Company, which established a line to Lokoga at the confluence of the Niger and Binue, 300 miles from the sea. Meanwhile the British Government had made efforts to open up both branches, and to lay down charts. Under an impulse given by Prince Consort, Parliament voted over £50,000 for the expedition of Her Majesty’s ships Albert, Wilberforce, and Soudan, during which the Government obtained the cession of a large tract of country about the confluence at Lokoga, where the British flag flies to this day. Another important expedition was that of 1854-5, during which were laid down most careful charts of the Binue for some hundreds of miles. In 1857 Parliament voted a five years' subsidy, averaging £7,000 a year, to Mr. Macgregor Laird, to assist him in developing trade in these rivers, and it was expressly stated on that occasion that immediate results could not be expected, but that posterity would reap the benefit. In a letter dated the 29th April, 1864, Earl Russell stated that he was willing to recommend a further subsidy of £6,000 for the same object. The proposal fell through—indeed, was rendered unnecessary by the springing up of British trade, which has lasted to the present day."", 'last_edit_date': '1884-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1884#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'What the Royal Niger Company is Doing for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""It looks as if chartered companies were the destined means of opening up and civilizing the Dark Continent. What the newly chartered East Africa Company are proposing to accomplish on the East Coast, the Royal Niger Company are doing on the West, and apparently with more success than the colonial Governments which draw their life from Downing-street. Lord Aberdare is Governor of the Royal Niger Company, and Sir George Taubman-Goldie Deputy-Governor; and in conversation with the latter a representative elicited some information as to the operations of the corporation. First of all, as to the difficulties which such companies have to encounter, they may be put down under three heads. The first great obstacle is this, that negroes have everything to learn. They have been accustomed hitherto to supply their immediate wants, and nothing more, so that beyond this minimum they have to be taught everything. It is slow work to teach them how to produce articles which are in request in Europe. A trade has been gradually growing up, but that only extends to certain regions, and, unfortunately for Western Africa, the articles of trade which have thus come into use—palm oil, for instance—have fallen very largely in price, as much as 50 per cent. That has been one of the great difficulties of the past three or four years. In the second place, there is the labour difficulty. Being unaccustomed to labour, they are averse to it. The Niger Company has had less to contend with in this respect than those in other parts of Africa, for although the natives near the coast are naturally idle, those in the interior are of more industrious habits. Some day imported labour will be necessary—either Chinese or coolie—not to extirpate the natives, but to serve as an example. The third great difficulty is the climate. Near the seaboard the country is undoubtedly pestilential. As you leave the mangrove swamps and palm forests behind and reach the interior, you come to a climate which, while totally unfit for European colonization, is fully as healthy as many parts of India. The difficulties arising from the climate are, therefore, not insuperable, if proper precautions are taken.\n\nWith respect to European jealousies and interference, there seems no ground for alarm on that score. The newspapers have reported that German merchants have complained of the administration of the Niger Company, but as a matter of fact there is not a single German trader in the whole of the Company's territory. There was one some time ago, but he was tried and deported by Sir James Marshall, C.M.G., for a long period Chief Justice of the Gold Coast Colony, and now of the Niger territories. His offence was inciting the natives to rebellion and bloodshed. The whole case of the German Colonial Society in Berlin thus falls to the ground."", 'last_edit_date': '1888-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1888#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE ROYAL NIGER COMPANY, CHARTERED & LIMITED.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We can hardly impress too strongly on our shareholders the fact that our hopes of future prosperity rest far less on the lower regions of the Niger, which first attracted British enterprise, and which even now yield the larger part of our trade, than upon the higher and inner and recently explored regions acquired at great expense of money and energy, but which, being so recently occupied and imperfectly developed, are at present rather a loss than a gain. Had we been less hopeful and more faint-hearted, had we been daunted by the large expenditure and certain losses necessarily consequent on this bold policy, our only course would have been to sell our interests, our treaties, our assets to some foreign Power, and so secure our shareholders from immediate loss.

Last year we made, if we include, as we must for purposes of comparison, the interest on the £250,000 of Niger Government stock, a profit of about £40,000; although there have now been for some time two other companies trading there.

Thereafter, up to about 1906, over 18000 New World Africans mostly aided by the ACS settled, annually, in Liberia in congeries of over thirty towns close to the Atlantic littoral on land obtained by the ACS or the Liberian government from the African chiefs of the region.

The other European Powers, one after the other signified their recognition of the Republic. America added her recognition in 1862. President Roberts, who undertook a tour through Europe for the purpose of obtaining the recognition of the Powers, was well received in England, and was not only able to conclude a commercial treaty, but was accepted as an ally in the prosecution of the campaign against the slave trade on the West African coast, and was presented with a gunboat to enable him to carry on the repression of the traffic in Liberian waters. He, in 1849, took an active part in an expedition of the Powers against the slade traders, who had their headquarters in the northern territory lying between Liberia and Sierra Leone. It was felt that if the whole coast could be held under anti-slavery supervision the trade might be extirpated, and in 1850 the West Coast territory to Cape Turner was purchased from the owners and placed under the guardianship of Liberia. Robertsport was founded this year, and commemorates the name of the President. The population of the Republic was rapidly increasing, her territory was extended towards the interior by treaties with the chiefs, and in 1857 the colony of Maryland was by its own request annexed.

The restriction by which white men were forbidden to hold land was also removed. Towns were multiplied and exploration of the interior began to attract attention.

There are no towns of any size between Grand Bassa and Harper, but merely a few villages scattered at intervals along the coast. Harper is situated on Cape Palmas, and has a harbour immediately opposite, which is sufficiently commodious and affords ships cruising in this part of the world a pleasant change after the eternal surf of the West African shores. The town looks uncommonly well from the sea. The church spires peep out from amongst the trees, and the shingle-framed houses of the Liberians surrounded by gardens add picturesqueness to the scene. Harper possesses, besides old churches, an academy, a hospital, an orphan asylum, and a lighthouse. The latter is more of ornament than use, as the Republic cannot afford to keep it constantly lighted. Adjacent to the lighthouse is the flagstaff which bears the Liberian national flag, the same as the American ensign, with the exception that instead of many stars there is only one. The practically prohibitive taxation at present imposed by the Government will end in the withdrawal of all Europeans from the country, as it is now an impossibility to get at the interior of the country, and the amount of trade that can be indulged in at the open ports is not sufficiently remunerative in view of the heavy taxation imposed. At present the German traders are anxiously expecting the arrival of the German squadron from Europe, when they are hoping the Admiral in command will bring the requisite pressure to bear on the authorities to induce them to open out to them the interior of the country. The people here may be called prosperous; if they would not ape white men\'s ways, they would be all the better. Some are well educated, and quite *au fait* in the politics of the world, but they appear to have a great dislike to foreigners of any kind, and a wish to keep Liberia wholly and solely for the Liberians. It should be pointed out that the effect of present restrictions is to keep Liberia utterly impotent to enforce her authority within her territory, and to prevent her doing anything to advance the material condition of the country, and that if this policy be persisted in, the inevitable result would be that Liberia would be absorbed by a European Power. The Americans washed their hands of a Liberian protectorate years ago, and are not likely to embroil themselves with any Power over such a figment as ""Liberian independence."" The officials of the Republic are wretchedly paid. The Governor of Harper\'s income is only about £75 a-year; his house is furnished in the meanest style, and he appears to augment his salary by supplying ships with fresh provisions. The constitution of Liberia, as well as the institutions, the manners and customs of the people, and the language itself, appear to be modelled upon those of the United States. The pure Liberian guesses and calculates quite as much as do his white brothers in New York, and speaks with that nasal twang peculiar to the land of the stars and stripes. Manhood suffrage is one of the Liberian institutions, but this ""manhood suffrage"" involves the qualification of being possessed of real property to the extent of fifty dollars. Harper exports little but palm oil, and that little appears to be dwindling to still lower limits. The inhabitants appear to take a deep interest in politics, and elections and the state of parties seem to create as deep and universal interest here as in more civilized countries. A Liberian youth of sixteen or so being asked how often the President was elected, replied ""biennially,"" and proceeded to give an account of the political institutions of the country, which showed that the education of the Liberian youth is thorough, and embraces politics as well as more widely-taught subjects. The President of the Republic resides at Monrovia, the capital, where the Houses of Assembly sit. The salary attached to the Presidential office is only £400 a-year and a residence—not a very magnificent sum, but large enough in this country, where living is cheap, the expenses of life small. The solitary Englishman in Liberia is located at a place called Tabon, and is engaged in trading with the natives. He has for some time refused to pay the exorbitant taxes assessed upon him, and the Government has no force to compel him, with the result that many of the natives are inclined to follow his example. As the Government has no means of transport, they are unable to send any troops from Monrovia to Tabon, from which it is distant about 200 miles, and, probably, even if they could, they would hesitate to do so from fear of complications with the English Government, especially as the boundaries of Liberia are not at present clearly defined, and her Majesty\'s Government has declined to recognize any portion of the country to be Liberian territory when the Government of the country is not capable of enforcing its authority. The officials say that the President has invoked the assistance of the United States, and that an American ship is at present on its way to Tabon, to set matters right; but the Americans are much too cute to trouble themselves over such a paltry matter. A wide and deep river runs into the sea here, but it is ruined by a bar at its mouth, which prevents navigation. This matters little at the present time, but in the future, when Liberia has been annexed or roused from its present state of stagnation, means will probably be found to obviate this fatal impediment to navigation, both here and elsewhere, along the coast. A very few miles off, another large river—the Carallo—discharges itself into the sea, and is likely to become of great commercial importance in the future, as gold washings have been found on its banks. This river has been ascended for nearly 200 miles, and is stated to be navigable for that distance. This country is more valuable in every way than our Gold Coast Colony: it possesses three or four fairly good harbours, whereas the latter cannot boast of one. There is an absence of that terrible surf which makes landing or the transference of cargo almost impossible, and the country itself appears to be more productive, to have greater mineral wealth, and to ""tap"" a more valuable part of the Dark Continent. The estimated population of Liberia is about 767,000, only about 30,000 of whom are descendants of freed slaves from the United States, the remainder being the aborigines or ""heathen,"" as they are termed by the ""Liberians.""', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.615, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE FUTURE OF LIBERIA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We learn from New York that, from accounts received there, it is evident that Liberia is much agitated over the encroachments of European Powers in that part of Africa.\n\nThese are trying times for the Republic.

The French crossed the frontier of Ashantee into Liberian territory and established military stations, which they have refused to leave. Unfortunately, there is no Power to which Liberia can look for protection, unless to the United States. The country is prosperous, and is making great headway in the direction of civilization and wealth; but the fear that the Republic will be swallowed up by some European Power tends greatly to check the progress and development of the country. The Republic is a market for almost every kind of American manufactured goods and of foods. In return the United States gets its palm oil, palm kernels, dye woods, ivory, and coffee, and should a line of steamers be established to run regularly between New York and Liberia the country might become a centre for the shipping of many of the products of Africa, its chief port being convenient as a central depot from which they could be shipped to the United States. The caravans which bring ivory and other products from the interior of Monrovia return bearing American calico, bacon, and general manufactures; but as yet the only means of direct communication between Liberia and the United States is a line of sailing vessels. The mails are brought indirectly by way of England, and are very irregular.

Having failed in an attempt to settle at Sherbro, they sought and found refuge on Providence Island, at the mouth of the Mesurado river, and finally on Cape Mesurado, where now stands the capital of the republic.\n\nThe second decade, commencing with 1830, might be called the period of expansion, when the colony at Cape Mesurado feeling itself sufficiently well established began to send out colonies, and planted the settlements at Bassa and Sinoe on the coast, and Millsburg and Caldwell on the St. Paul's.\n\nThe third decade, commencing with 1840, might be called the period of consolidation or independence. During this period the necessity was pressed upon the scattered settlements of not only closely co-operating but of declaring themselves one independent state under the name and style of the Republic of Liberia. It was during this period that the last white governor died, and the colonial Government was assumed and conducted (for five years) by one of the colonists under the direction of the American Colonization Society until July, 1847, when the colony became an independent Republic.\n\nThe fourth decade commences with 1850, and might be called the period of diplomatic extension. It was during this period that most of our treaties with foreign nations were formed, and we became known to the European world.\n\nThe fifth decade begins with 1860, and might be called the agricultural period. It was during this decade that, through the large accessions of recaptured Congoes, our farmers were enabled to extend their cultivation of the soil and prove what was before doubted, that exclusive devotion to the soil will yield a comfortable living and a competence in Liberia.\n\nThe sixth decade begins with 1870, and might be called the period of upheaving. It was during this decade now just closed that the Republic experienced the most serious strain on its domestic and foreign relations; when the thoughtful at home were alarmed and our friends abroad were anxious.

While the African Times was printing last month there was being held what was grandiloquently styled the ""LIBERIAN ANNUAL BALL,"" seemingly, so far as we can make out, for the especial glorification of Mr. David Chinnery, in the character of his Excellency David Chinnery, Chargé d\'Affaires of the Republic of Liberia, and the Honourable Mrs. Chinnery! Mrs. Chinnery, of course, is not to blame for having the title of ""honourable"" improperly tacked to her name; and we merely notice it as an additional proof of the very questionable use made in this country at the present time of titles supposed to be derived from Liberia! We take it for granted, though we are not at all satisfied on this subject, that the appointment of Mr. Chinnery as Chargé d\'Affaires by the now deposed and imprisoned President Roye carried with it the designation of ""excellency,"" irrespective of whether Mr. Chinnery should be or should not be received and acknowledged as Chargé d\'Affaires by the British Government, to which it has been naturally supposed he was accredited; but which we believe we are correct in stating has never received or acknowledged him in that capacity. Even this, however, would not give the title of ""honourable"" to the wife of Mr. Chinnery. We repeat that we hope the new President of Liberia will exhibit the good sense of putting an end to what only seems to make Liberia ridiculous. A state with a gross revenue of about 10,000l. a-year, without (as Mr. Roye over and over again officially asserted in answer to just claims) a single cent* in its treasury, and unable to pay the salaries of its home officers, can only be made absurd by reiterated puffs of Liberian breakfasts, Liberian banquets, Liberian annual balls, &c. There may be new modes of making private fortunes, but there is no new mode of building up states. This can only be accomplished by the patient industry of their people and the development of natural, agricultural, and mineral resources. A loan, the annual interest on which is almost equal to the gross revenue, will not do it; but only serve to plunge the country deeper into debt and dishonour. Liberia ought not to have thought of raising money by loan until she possessed a surplus revenue at least equal to the charge that would fall upon her treasury for the annual interest thereon—a real, not a supposititious or purely imaginary surplus. Such an operation, if wisely conducted, is a mere capitalisation of the annual surplus; and, if raised without too great sacrifices, and honestly and economically applied in forwarding reproductive works, may often be very useful in creating additional public resources while increasing the well-being of the people. Liberia, without capitalists of her own, poor—we may almost say with truth, penniless—repels, instead of inviting, capital from other countries (except in the instance of the late most unjustifiable loan). She claims to possess a very large territory—600 miles of sea-board, unbounded as regards the interior, and is still greedily seeking to have her title acknowledged to other territories, such as the Gallinas, &c. Her immigrant population from the States is only about 15,000 to 17,000, yet no one can buy or own land, houses, &c., but an African—a Liberian. Thus she has made her bed, and an uncomfortable one it is; many of her population—we write of that immigrant population—starving in a land of immense natural resources, and very advantageously situate both as regards Europe and America. While the slave-trade was still in vigour, and before Liberia had been acknowledged as an African State by European Powers and by the United States, we can understand that there might be reasonable grounds for excluding Europeans or other strangers from possession of the soil. But, thanks to the indefatigable efforts of the now venerable as respected Mr. Gerard Ralston, so many years unpaid Consul-General, and who never aspired to be an ""excellency,"" Liberia has been acknowledged by every European Power; the slave-trade from Africa is for ever at an end; and even slavery itself is rapidly disappearing everywhere, except in the native heathen countries of Africa. There could no longer be any danger to Liberians in permitting Europeans to purchase as much land as they may choose. They would not buy more than they could utilise by their capital; they could only utilise what they might purchase by employing Liberians, by which in a short time many of these might be enriched, and many more be made comfortable, having their wants properly supplied by means of wages for their labour. Sugar, cotton, coffee, might be produced in large quantities for the European market, while it is notorious that enterprising men, owners of soil, having capital to work with, and with life and property duly protected, might soon double or treble the production of that great African staple, palm-oil. Europeans would never so throng the country as to be dangerous to the Liberians; and we see no other mode by which Liberia can progress than by welcoming them. With regard to the money lately raised by the loan in England, we now say distinctly and unhesitatingly—as we have before indicated—that in our opinion there is but one honourable course for Liberia to pursue. She cannot, with any regard for her own character, denounce and imprison the men who have raised the money for her and at the same time herself appropriate the plunder. She ought to restore to the bondholders all that remains of the money they have paid on their bonds, on condition of their giving up those bonds to be cancelled in exchange for that money, and for new bonds at par with 5 per cent. interest, for the balance which her poverty will not allow her at present to restore. Then, conducting herself modestly, without creating ""excellencies"" and ""lady honourables,"" without puffing English breakfasts, banquets, and so-called annual Liberian balls, she will soon become respected, and enlist the sympathies of the wise and the good of all countries. She has the choice of good and evil now before her. We have as above briefly indicated what she will become if she choose the good; but if the temptation be too great for her—if she cannot resist appropriating to herself what remains of the loan money, she plunges into an abyss where nothing can save her from contempt and shame.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-02-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1872#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Progress of Liberia', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Every true friend of Africa and its peoples must feel a deep interest in Liberia. The first independent civilized African State on the West Coast, she occupies a position of great honour and usefulness. With institutions framed on the model of those of the United States of America, she stands out boldly before the world asserting and proving that there is no lack of natural ability in the civilized African to work the machinery of free institutions. Her President, her judges, her learned professors, are Christian Africans; no white man holds any political position in the country; the nation is essentially negro, and is so far from feeling any need of European or American aid in carrying on the various departments of her government, that she does more than discourage, she prohibits the permanent settlement of white men within her borders. They may come there for purposes of trade, but they are not permitted to acquire landed property; African she is, and exclusively African she is determined to remain. The enemies and libellers of the African race not unfrequently point to Liberia with contempt and ridicule, because she has not obtained in infancy the development of manhood; because, having no capital but what has been created by the industry of her own people, she is not able to undertake those works of civilization which are so much needed for the rapid development of her great natural resources; because, amid the abundant elements of wealth existing in her rich tropical fertility, and with her capability of producing so many objects that Europe requires and is compelled to seek even at the opposite side of the world, her Government is poor, and her revenue insufficient, without constant patriotic self-denial on the part of her principal citizens, for the support of those establishments indispensable to a free Christian State, which includes within her borders a native heathen population more than twenty times exceeding in number the civilized population of which the State really consists. But so far from there being anything in her public condition to justify contempt and ridicule such as our ignorantly-learned anthropologists would heap upon her and her people, every impartial man will find cause in her for wonder and felicitation that a mere handful of people brought to the African Coast from the degrading servitude of the late Slave States of the great American Republic should have fallen into so few errors, and have made such rapid progress. For it must be especially borne in mind that no comparison between Liberia and an English colony would be fair. An English colony, however small the number of emigrants and their descendants may be, is constantly and from its very birth receiving assistance from realized British capital. But the African emigrants from the United States to Liberia have not had any such resources at their back. They or their fathers have been slaves; and their only means of reaching Liberia was by the gift of a free passage, with six months free support after arrival, by the Colonization Society which founded this refuge for emancipated slaves on the West Coast of Africa. There have been no African Crusoes to help to build up this African Republic; the wealth, whatever it may be, within her is only the surplus of what her own people have created, over and above what they required for their own support. The progress thus made must necessarily be slow in comparison with that of an English colony anywhere, although it may be, as it has been in reality, rapid when viewed only in connexion with the elements available for promoting it. But we hope and believe that the time is now approaching when that progress will be greatly stimulated. Liberia, formed of American Africans, strongly imbued with the Republican principles so extreme in the American people, is not likely to attract any new elements of wealth and population from any other country than that from which its present civilized population has been derived. Ardently desiring as we do to see a rapid advance in Liberia, we rejoiced when we foresaw, as an inevitable consequence of the civil war in the United States, an increased emigration of emancipated Africans from those states to Liberia. The extreme change in the position of the late slaves in America, who have been so suddenly elevated from a debasing bondage, from a condition in which they were estimated rather as beasts than as men, to the full privileges of citizenship, political as well as social, has, however, retarded that movement toward Africa which would otherwise have impelled large numbers of the emancipated to Liberia. Still, the desire to become citizens of an exclusively African Republic, and that in Africa, has been gradually spreading in America, and the Colonization Society, who sent a shipload of emigrants in November last, and another in May, will despatch their ship again in November next with a further addition of some 800 for the African Republic. From the published statements of the society we have reason to believe that 4,000 or 5,000 emigrants might have been sent to Liberia during the present year, instead of some 1,500, had the society been in possession of the requisite funds. We must express our hope that the Colonization Society will be able to obtain all the money it may require to realize the spontaneous desires of late American slaves to become Liberian citizens. It is only by a large increase in her civilized industrial population that Liberia can make rapid progress in production and wealth. She is limited to this source of increase by the elements of which she is composed, by the nature of her institutions, and the strong peculiarities of her people; and all who are desirous of seeing the West Coast countries and their peoples emerge from their barbarism and degradation and come within the sphere of Christian civilizing influences should assist the Colonization Society of the United States in conveying emigrants to Liberia. We had hoped that before 1870 her civilized population would there be increased to at least 50,000. She could with the assistance rendered by the society for six months after the arrival of the emigrants in Liberia have very well established the requisite number, or even a greater number, within her borders before that period could they have been sent to her; and such an addition to her civilized labourers on her coasts and the rich lands of her navigable rivers would, we are convinced, soon give to the carping libellers of the African race new and forcible evidence of the just claim of the African to the rights and sympathies of a common brotherhood with the hitherto more favoured European.', 'last_edit_date': '1867-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1867#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.613, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""LIBERIA'S FALSE FRIENDS"", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'That admirable periodical, the *Monrovia Observer*, hits hard, in a recent number, at those on whose doings we have from time to time animadverted, as inflicting no little injury on Liberia.

Barclay, Secretary of State of Liberia, wrote as follows to Charles Hall Adams, Esq., Consul at Boston: ""In former years the volume of trade between the two countries (Liberia and the United States) was much larger than at present. Our palm oil and camwood were the chief productions exported to the United States, but since kerosene and cotton seed oil have come prominently to the front there, the exports of palm oil to that country have become almost nil compared with what it used to be. In those days it was not an uncommon thing for a single ship to take, among other products, palm oil to the value of 28,000 dols. to 36,000 dols. The vacancy caused by the decline of the trade of this article in the United States has not been filled. Your figures with reference to the export of coffee into the United States have been carefully scanned. We are entirely in accord as to the fact that our trade in this article might be increased to much larger proportions, and the quantity exported to the United States might be multiplied a hundred fold. Yet when the facts of the culture being in its infancy and of there being no banks nor other financial institutions to assist the growers, and no machinery, except in a few instances, are considered, I am of the opinion that our cultivators have made a tolerable good showing in foreign markets. The total product for 1887 was about 1,200,000 lbs., which are distributed as follows: to Germany, 606,000 lbs.; United States, 301,000 lbs.; Belgium, France, and England, 149,000 lbs.; Holland and 150,000 lbs.""\n\nBishop William Taylor, in his Quadrennial Report, states: ""The productive interests of Liberia are fairly prosperous. Within ten miles of Monrovia, up the St. Paul\'s river, there are ten steam sugar-cane crushing mills, and during the past year more than 600,000 lbs. of coffee have been exported from Monrovia.""\n\nThe fact should be noted that, by act of the national Parliament of Brazil in May, slavery was abolished throughout the Empire. For years a popular feeling in favour of emancipation has been growing; but now the government has suddenly moved in the matter and the glorious deed is done. This act is one in which philanthropists and Christians may well rejoice, and it will have an important bearing on the interests of the kingdom of Christ in Brazil and in Africa.

If any of us try to do a little trading whereby we may progress, we are opposed, oppressed, and all kind of stratagems will be used to prevent our success. Hence we are living here not in harmony and love; every man is opposed to the progress of his neighbour in whatever pursuit he follows; whether it be in the mercantile line or farming, it seems as a dagger driven into us to see any one else prosper; very few sympathise with their fellow-citizen when misfortune happens to him, and fewer still will give any aid except for a large reward. Even the immigrants who are invited by us from America to come and help us to build up this black nationality, when they come out, except they possess a little money, are looked down upon with disdain and contempt by the other citizens; any advantages that can be taken of them will be taken. Sometimes we may be paid by the merchants when we are in their employment in Liberian currency, and if without leaving the store we give them back the currency for the purchase of some article in their store, they refuse to take the very currency they paid us, demanding specie of us; and if they do take it, it will be at a discount; and when foreigners come here to reside among us to do business, whether they be our colour or white men, whereby we can get articles cheaper, be employed, and the country built up for our benefit, the majority of people are against them, and they will try everything in their power to entrap them in law-suits; they will go to their places of business, abuse, insult, curse and swear at them, and some of our young men, when in the employment of foreigners, will skulk away a part of their time in idleness; and if their employers bring them up for it they will question their authority in doing so, and begin to speak of their freedom, and demand full pay for the time they have wasted in idleness; and if the foreigners refuse to pay them they are taken to law and made to pay, for our laws, Mr. Editor, are all one-sided. No foreigners or new-comers expect to get justice in Liberia; if they do, they will certainly drain the pockets well first. Whether this is done from the ignorance of the people, or whether they are influenced by the few merchants here, I cannot say; one thing I know, that this is a practice in the Republic, to take all advantage they can of foreigners, that they may be discouraged and leave the country. I am a supporter of foreigners, for without foreigners we cannot live. America receives into her country immigrants of all nations. The Dutchman finds a home and welcome; he brings with him skill and science, and puts them in operation. The Frenchman, the Englishman, the German, and Italian find welcome hands beckoning them to come; therefore America has advanced to what she is this day. Why can\'t Liberia stretch out her hands to all nations, and invite them into her country? Why can\'t Liberia open her ""Constitution,"" and allow all nations to come in and build her up? Why do Liberians take advantage of foreigners and strangers, and combine together against them? These are the things that keep us from progressing. Since our Government was a Government it has been in an embarrassed state; never was Liberia able to redeem her currency in gold and silver, as she reports. These things can be easily remedied if better steps were to be taken, and selfishness and self-conceit put away.', 'last_edit_date': '1869-05-08', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1869#article-29', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.613, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LIBERIA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Liberia Herald publishes a very sensible letter from Dr. Hodgkin, disapproving of the general 15 per cent. duties on imports, as sure to lead to excessive smuggling, &c.

Less effective were embargoes on the export or import of items such as horses, weapons, salt or types of cloth, while an indiscriminate blockade of towns or areas was difficult to sustain, not least because smuggling offered high profits.

What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'. France, he continued, was guaranteeing 'the economic growth and human development' of its colonies. 2"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': 'The European Scramble for East Africa and the patterns of African resistance > The response in Kenya', 'content': ""African response to all this was, as already indicated, both military and diplomatic, though at times there was withdrawal, non-co-operation or passivity. The Nandi in Kenya, for instance, resisted militarily the construc› tion of the railway through their territory. Of all the peoples of Kenya, they put up the strongest and longest military resistance to British im› perialism; it began in the 1890s and did not end until their leader was murdered by the British commanders in 1905, on his way to the negotiations which had been treacherously arranged. That event weakened Nandi resistance and eventually led to the British occupation of their territory.\nThat the Nandi resisted the British for over seven years was due to the nature of their society. Nandi society was divided into territorial units called pororiet. Warriors from each unit were responsible for the defence of the territory. For this reason, the warriors slept in a common hut. This was the nearest thing to a standing army. These territorial armies came together under the leadership of an orgoiyot, or traditional leader. It was he who decided when the army would go on a raid. The armies were linked to him through a personal representative who sat at each territorial council. Because territory rather than clan was the centre of Nandi social life, this meant that clan rivalry was absent. The result was a cohesive society, and it was this cohesion that gave the society military superiority over its neighbours. Maison writes that 'It is surprising that so small a tribe as the Nandi was able to terrorize much larger peoples and to continue to do so almost with impunity for several decades.' 11 Given the social cohesion of the society as well as the confidence of the warriors both in themselves and in their leaders, it is not surprising that they became a military power to reckon with. Their military successes led them to believe that they were superior to other people, white men included. As G. W. B. Huntingford noted, 'The Nandi thinks himself at least the equal, if not the superior of the whiteman; and any estimate of the changes brought about by the impact of our civilization must be considered in the light of this fact'.$^{12}$ The Nandi successfully resisted this occupation for over seven years, then, because of the success with which the society had been knit together as a fighting force."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'Military conquest, 1885-1902 > Why were European powers able to conquer Africa?', 'content': 'European powers were able to conquer Africa with such relative ease because in virtually every respect the dice was so heavily loaded in their favour.

In fact, African reactions were the very reverse. It is quite evident that Africans were faced with only two options, either to readily surrender their sovereignty and independence, or to defend them at all costs. It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.\nJohn D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty.

He had been trying by all possible means to bring the Juabins to serve under him again, but they refused. He then sent threatening messages to them, whereupon they took up arms against him, and were joined by Quocofoo and Mampon.\n\nOn the arrival of Captain Lees, the King endeavoured to impress on him the importance of his power; but he was soon undeceived, as the homely truth was soon brought to him that he had none. He wanted to have all the chiefs again under his government; but he was told that the British Government is perfectly neutral in the matter; if the chiefs like to return, they may; but if not, they may remain as they are. He was very much annoyed and downcast at this decision, but there was no help for it. He was plainly told, should he go to war against Juabin, that Quocofoo, Mampon, and others would join them; and the result would be, that he would be dethroned and somebody else put in his place. After a good deal of palavering, he gave in, and Captain Lees, after much talk, got him to agree to the five following propositions:—\n\n1. The separation and independence of Juabin.\n2. That there must be general peace between all parties.\n3. That all prisoners in the possession of each party should be delivered, so that those who wish to return may do so.\n4. That roads to the interior be kept opened, and no party shall be molested whilst passing through for trade, &c.\n5. That all old quarrels are to be buried, and not to be raked up again.\n\nAfter the King had agreed to these, Captain Lees went to Juabin, saw the King and Chiefs, and then explained to them all the advantages they would obtain by this arrangement, which they finally agreed to accept. The King of Ashanti wanted them to come and eat fetish with him, or ratify the agreement in Kumasi; but the wily Juabins were too wide awake, and would not, as they said ""Koffee Carry Carry has got very bad fetish.""

The troubles which had broken out between certain natives of the delta and some British merchants were repressed by a very successful expedition, and the peace then established has not been again disturbed. You will also remember that not long before our last meeting, two members of our Council had returned from a special mission to the Territories, during which they had visited a Mohammedan Emir then engaged in hostilities with the Company.

Dr. Moloney left England last May, at the head of an expedition, including among its members Lieuts. Elwes and Biscoe, and several other Englishmen. The expedition proceeded direct to Bandawe, on the west shore of Lake Nyassa, north of Kota Kota, where a number of carriers and native soldiers were enlisted. Dr. Moloney did not find it necessary to fire a single shot during the whole of his journey.\n\nThe objects of the expedition were to locate certain territory in Northern Rhodesia lying between Lake Tanganyika and the Stevenson Road on the north, Portuguese East Africa on the south, the Nyassaland Protectorate on the east, and the Congo State on the west. This territory had never been explored, but had been visited by Dr. Livingstone, the late Mr. Joseph Thompson, and the present Acting Commissioner in British Central Africa. It is inhabited by people of Zulu origin, who have displaced the aborigines. After a stay of five months Dr. Moloney returned last January to Lake Nyassa, and returned to England a few weeks ago. In an interview with a representative of Reuter\'s agency, Dr. Moloney said: ""Although the territories to the west of Nyassa are perfectly peaceful at present, there are certain political conditions that will have to be treated from a diplomatic standpoint. The territory visited by me is divided into two parts—Northern and Southern Angoniland. Although recent operations in Nyassaland have subjugated the Arab slave traders in the Protectorate, there are four chiefs in this territory who will have to be reckoned with in the future. These men are Mpseni, Chekusi, Chewire, and Ongonomo. Three of them exercise certain power within the Protectorate itself.

Mr. Joseph Thompson, in visiting Mpseni, had to retreat after a few hours, and Mr. Alfred Sharpe only escaped with his life through Herr Viese\'s intercession.

At last the efforts made have been crowned with success. The contending factions were grouped into two opposing sides. On the one side were the Ibadans, a powerful tribe situated right in the centre of the region of the war, and, therefore, surrounded by enemies; and on the other was a confederation of tribes under the general name of the Ekitiparapos. Man-catching was the real object of the war, and herein lay the great difficulty in the way of mediation; for it was obvious that none of the man-catching tribes would surrender their main source of revenue without a struggle. However, with the aid of two educated natives, a treaty of peace was signed in July, 1886, and ratified in the following September.\n\nThe first circumstance which opened up a prospect of successful mediation was an intimation received by Administrator Moloney, at Lagos, of a quarrel between the King of the Sebus and his people, the former wanting to continue the war and the latter to end it. It was not till long afterwards that Sir Samuel Rowe felt he was justified in interfering. His first attempt was not encouraging, but ultimately the Kings of the Ekitiparapos confederacy, twenty-six in number, appealed to the Governor, stating their grievances against the Ibadans, and asking him to prevent their being supplied with ammunition from Lagos through the agency of an Ibadan there.\n\nThe answer came from Mr. Moloney, who had assumed the government of the colony, and he addressed it to all the belligerents, rating them soundly for continuing the war, and offering his services as mediator. The replies were favourable. An armistice was arranged, and conferences were held. Statements setting forth the case for each tribe separately were forwarded to the Governor. In one of them (from the commander of the Jebus) the following passage occurs: ""Ile Ife is regarded by all our nation as the sacred spot from which we originated, and the Oni is respected as the father of all the Kings. This is why the Jebu King felt it his duty to reinstate the Ifes in the town. It was from Ile Ife that his father went to settle in the Jebu country. His father did not die, but he was converted into a rock, which could still be seen. Even the English King can be shown the spot at Ile Ife from whence his ancestors went out.

A caravan sent into the interior by the Dutch establishment, Afrikaansche Handels-Vermootschap, was pillaged, and had two men killed. In consequence of this aggression, all the European establishments declared war against the natives of these villages. A body of 150 armed negroes, recruited among the *personnel* of the Dutch, French, and Portuguese factories, and commanded by fifteen Europeans, went to the hostile villages to inflict chastisement. The natives yielded at first, but having been gradually reinforced by new combatants, they afterwards offered a vigorous resistance. The chief of a body of Krooboys having been wounded, his men, to the number, of eighty-four, took to flight. The Europeans, numbering seventy combatants, could not sustain the onset of the united forces of the natives, and were obliged to retreat hastily. During the retreat, the agent of a French house, M. Barbier, was killed, and three Europeans were wounded. The natives pursued the Europeans as far as Nokki, and disposed themselves to attack simultaneously that point and the point of Wang-Wang. Owing to this danger, M. Gresshoff, principal agent of the Afrikaansche Handels-Vermootschap, addressed a pressing demand for succour to Major Parminter. His letter arrived at Vivi at nightfall, and Major Parminter immediately assembled the Houssas at his disposal and sent them to the relief of the threatened establishments. The steamers of the Association, Belgique and Espérance, were, unfortunately, at this moment down the river. The small troop had, therefore, to embark in native boats, and they arrived at Nokki after a very perilous voyage, accomplished on a river whose current is known to be of extreme violence. On reaching Nokki, arrangements were made to secure the safety of the European establishments. Mr. Shaw, who commanded the relief party, had been ordered by his chief to give every assistance to the Europeans in case of an attack by the natives. It had been especially enjoined on him not to resort to force before having tried to enter into negotiations with the natives, and used every effort in conformity with the principles of the Association in order to prevent the shedding of blood. He was to hoist the flag of the Association, so that the natives could perceive that they now had to do with it. The sight of the flag produced on the assailants the moral effect which the Chief of Vivi expected from it. The natives abstained from a new attack. Landing on the following day at Nokki, Mr. Parminter found there the Association's steamer Belgique, which had arrived with reinforcements from Bonna. Mr. Parminter returned to his post at Vivi, leaving at the threatened point a detachment of Houssas, under the orders of one of his agents, in the hope that their presence would prevent a renewal of hostilities. He offered at the same time hospitality and protection at Vivi to the English missionaries at Under Hill, and also to Mrs. Crudgington, in case they did not think themselves safe at their station. He also authorized one of the agents of the Association to place himself at the disposal of the house Daumas-Béraud of Paris until it could replace M. Barbier. Before leaving Nokki, Mr. Parminter received the thanks and congratulations of the European agents, who begged to express their gratitude to the Committee for the prompt and efficacious help which they had received in a moment of peril. Mr. Parminter had offered the Europeans to open, in their name, negotiations with the natives in order to bring about the cessation of hostilities and the re-establishment of peace, but the excitement caused by the late events, and especially by the death of M. Barbier, was still too great for his offer to be accepted. Thanks to the measures taken by Mr. Parminter, tranquillity was not again disturbed; but on February 17 a post which had neglected on that day to hoist the flag of the Association was taken for a post belonging to the factories, and attacked by the natives. In this attack a Zanzibarite was killed and another wounded. When the packet left, the natives had again threatened the factories. The Sagittaire was on the way to Nokki, followed by two small Portuguese men-of-war. From the foregoing, it follows undoubtedly that the International Association has gained considerable influence in the country, and, according to its promises, this influence is used in the interests of the cause which the Association professes to serve."", 'last_edit_date': '1884-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1884#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.61, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ENGLISH CIVILISATION IN THE NIGER REGION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""And what impression has your tour made?""—""We have returned well satisfied with the work of administration and also with the commercial development which is going on.

Although tribal wars are still frequent among the pagans, they are greatly diminished in number and intensity, and disputes are so frequently referred to the Company\'s district courts for decision as to demand a much larger staff than the present petty revenue of the Company can afford. I was especially struck with the great advance that has taken place of late years in the intelligence of the natives who have come in contact with Europeans.

Strong pressure has been brought to bear upon him by the Sultan of Sokoto, who is an ally of the Company, and with whom we have a treaty, to bring the Emir to a more pacific frame of mind. There is nothing in this hostility to cause the slightest anxiety, as the Company are perfectly able to cope with any force the Emir of Muri can bring against them.

He said that this resolution was a proper sequel to the one the meeting had just agreed to. One of the new kings of Africa had that day told them plainly that the South African Company intended to conduct its operations on the basis of the resolution, and he had read clauses in the charter referring to the abolition of the slave trade and the trade in alcohol, and that the trade in spirituous liquors would be regulated.

Since the abolition of the export of slaves, these localities have been the sites of trading stations, palm oil being the chief article of export. The traders have been, with few exceptions, British, and the capitalists mostly Liverpool merchants. The natives allowed trading hulks to be anchored and commerce conducted on payment of fixed sums, known as ""comey."" Bonny, Brass, and Old Calabar are among the oldest of these trading ports, the native chiefs being also the native traders. They possessed numerous slaves who were sent with merchandise to the interior markets to collect oil, which was brought to the stations and sold to the whites. Among the Bonny chiefs was the father of Ja Ja, late King of Opobo; his son was brought up to the management of the business, and on his father\'s death he succeeded to his position. Of his enemies the most powerful was Oko Jumbo, who lost no opportunity to humiliate him. The Europeans could only let matters take their course; they regretted constant fighting of Oko Jumbo and Ja Ja, but the relations between the Europeans and natives being strictly commercial, nothing could be done. Suffering reverses, Ja Ja was forced to fly with the remnant of his people after great slaughter at the hands of Oko Jumbo.

The scene of the conflict is to the west of Lake Nyassa, in the country known as Angoniland, within the British Central African Protectorate; and a confederacy of slave-dealing chiefs seems to have been formed, with King Mwasigungu at its head, whose object was to dispute the right of the British to interfere with their man-hunting expeditions. Nobody can impute a shadow of bloodguiltiness in this matter to our representatives. Every effort appears to have been made by our Consul-General to come to terms with the barbarous potentate; but Mwasigungu rejected all offers, and actually declared war. No doubt he felt confident of beating the small force of Sikhs and Natives, who could be brought against him, and, as far as numerical superiority went, his confidence was not misplaced. In the actual conflict, Lieut. Alston and Captain Stewart, who commanded the Sikh contingent, had only 150 men under them, to which must be added a body of five thousand Natives. This little army marched into the country of the slave-dealers, and in three battles succeeded in utterly routing King Mwasigungu and the other chiefs, although they had a force of twenty thousand fighters. The danger of the enterprise can be gauged from the fact that two strong stockades had to be taken by assault, and Lieut. Alston is mentioned as having gallantly led the storming parties. Fifty towns were captured by the victorious British troops, and 600 prisoners, including 14 chiefs, fell into their hands. One of the latter, a notorious character, with the stain of past murders on his soul, was taken to the shores of Lake Nyassa, and there tried, condemned, and executed. The loss in the slavedealers\' army was great, while six of the Sikhs seem to have fallen on our side. The capture of ninety guns, and the re-opening of the trade routes to the Luapula river, are not the greatest advantages to be derived from this achievement. The prestige of the Arab slave-dealers will have received a blow in all the region between the Portuguese border and the Loangwa; while the ability of the British to make their Protectorate a reality will be forcibly impressed on the Native mind. Not only has the capital of the presumptuous monarch been captured, but a fort has been built there and garrisoned by Protectorate troops, so that there will be a standing pledge and symbol of our authority in the heart of the country. Thus gradually the tide of civilisation sweeps over the darkest places of the Dark Continent, and not for the first or the last time has British daring and enterprise brought succour to the slave. If the process of ""ransoming the African"" has to be effected by violent means, then it is satisfactory to find that a force under the British flag is capable of meeting four times its number of Arabs, and putting them to rout.

At present, on the Upper Congo, Europeans have to content themselves with living in wattled huts or mud forts, roofed over with straw and grass, and there is, of course, great danger from fire. By means of the railway the State could at once transport about a dozen iron stations; and there would soon be erected houses, churches, and schools, all of iron. Then the native chiefs, seeing what the Europeans were doing, would build iron houses, and would likewise require iron warehouses for their goods. The Chief of Kintamo, for instance, already keeps all his goods in iron boxes; while the Chiefs of Old Calabar live in iron houses which have cost from £1,000 to £3,500 each. Then, again, there would be many steamers to be transported in sections, to be put together on the upper side of the cataracts. On the Upper Congo there are at present only seven steamers, mostly steam launches, but to carry on the enormous trade of the 7,000 miles of navigable waterway of the Upper Congo, large and swift steamers will be required, capable of stowing cargo and carrying passengers in comfort. Again, there would be a large trade in timber, and saw-mills would be required to cut it up, which mills would have to be taken up country by railway. Enormous quantities of powder and large numbers of flint-lock guns would also be in demand. All this is without counting the almost limitless trade to be done in cloth goods. I should say that within a reasonable number of years after the making of the railway there would be a trade of about £10,000,000 annually with the natives of the Upper Congo—all in barter.""\n\nPausing here, Mr. Stanley went on to say that there was a sentimental side to the whole question which was worthy of reflection. ""We have been enabled,"" he continued, ""with our own modest enterprise to secure something like 1,000 carriers a month to serve us in a country that, when I began work there, absolutely refused to have anything to do with us. Already we have some 400 native soldiers—all of which proves that the natives are friendly and willing to lend their services to the white man for his purposes. When the State can better afford it—which will be not long after the railway is finished—it will be able to enlist 3,000 or 4,000 native soldiers for the protection of the country against the slave-traders. Those stations which are to-day so modest and unoffending, and dare not take arms in their hands against the organized slave-traders, will, in a few months only after the opening of the railway, be in a position to take the offensive and absolutely prevent them from ever setting foot in the Congo State.""\n\n""That indeed would be worth working for,"" I remarked.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1886#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.608, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Policy of Non-Intervention in Western Africa: Its Mischievous Tendency on the Good Government of the Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I have been long studying the character of the Marabouts of this river, and in my humble opinion the only way to live in peace and amity with them is to deal with them as the French do.

A striking example is that of the Congo Free State, which, in addition to the magnificent endowment of King Leopold, is subsidised to the extent of £80,000 a year by the Belgian Government. Great Britain, on the other hand, has never contributed a shilling to aid us in our work of exploration, civilisation and extirpation of the slave trade. It would be idle to complain, even if we were disposed to do so, of being thus left entirely to our own resources, and it may be that in the long run we shall profit more from the energy evoked and the liberty fostered by independence of State subsidies and State interference. But it is an indisputable fact that commerce on the Niger has suffered heavily during the last three years from the pecuniary encouragement given to our foreign neighbours. No appreciable effect is indeed produced in respect of those articles of African produce such as gum, kernels, oil and rubber, which are not suited for land carriage over long distances; but in respect of one valuable product—viz., ivory, which is carried on the backs of slaves for immense distances at a small cost, these subsidies, which practically amount to bonuses to the local merchants, have unquestionably diverted a considerable value from the Niger markets to those of more favoured regions, and have thus diminished your annual dividends to the extent of at least 4 per cent. It is not easy to see how this result has benefited the taxpayers of the European States which pay these bonuses out of their home exchequers; but it has undoubtedly enriched the merchants of various nationalities trading in their African possessions at the expense of commerce in unsubsidised British possessions where the whole cost of administration and development has to be met by taxation on trade. Passing from these considerations of our external relations to our neighbours, I will say a few words on our own internal condition, that is on the progress of settlement within our present sphere of operations. You may perhaps remember that at our meeting two years ago I dwelt at considerable length on the great difficulties with which we have had to contend, apart from those arising from the unhealthiness of the climate and from the intermittent residence and consequent want of continuity in our staff in Africa. I pointed out that ""we have to deal with 800 tribes who have been for countless generations plunged in idle barbarism, whose sole idea of wealth has been the holding of slaves, and whose main occupation in life has been to acquire such slaves by intertribal war or kidnapping."" I am glad to be able to tell you that year by year there has been a steady growth of the whole, some influence and power of the Company—a growth necessarily slow and incomplete, but more rapid than we had ventured to anticipate. The missionaries in the Lower Niger have borne witness to the remarkable progress of peace and security under our rule. You must not understand me as saying that there is not still in those regions a vast amount of gross barbarism and uncurbed ferocity; but only that these have been mitigated and even in some places abated to a degree which more than justifies our presence there as the ruling power. Having achieved such striking success as far up the Niger as Lokoja, we have thought the time ripe for taking similar measures in the Pagan countries to the south of the Lower Benue; where, during the few years since we first established our stations, and probably for many years previously, incalculable miseries have been inflicted on the natives by slave hunters from the North and East. It is an inevitable consequence of these raids that their operations expand year by year in a wider circle, as belt after belt of country is devastated and depopulated, leaving no further prey for the slave hunters; so that tribes whom we had already commenced to train to peaceful commerce and whom we were teaching to utilise the natural resources of that fertile region, have disappeared, most of their members having been either killed or captured as slaves, while the more fortunate are hiding amongst the forests and rocks in hopes of escaping the fate of their companions. The region of which I am speaking is at present one of the principal hunting grounds for supplying the enormous and apparently insatiable demand for slaves in the Central Soudan and even as far as Morocco. You will at once understand that if we longer delayed taking the necessary remedial measures all hope of developing those fertile and once populous regions must be abandoned. We are therefore impelled by interest, as well as the ordinary feelings of humanity, to act decisively at this, the earliest practicable moment, and to afford these pagan populations— with whom we have made treaties—efficient protection to life, freedom, and property. We have, therefore, ordered the military occupation of this region, which is now being executed. This measure has demanded an increase to our small army and consequently additional expenditure, which must temporarily be met by increased taxation. I must remind you that although the establishment of peace and security will certainly bear fruit in largely increased commerce yielding a larger revenue, the immediate result will be only to preserve the trade already existing. The development which will naturally arise from a sense of security amongst the natives cannot be expected at once. You must remember that the greater portion of the taxation at present falls upon the Company, which is still by far the largest European trader in the territories, although no longer alone there, as at the time of the issue of the Charter. This has confirmed us in the belief that it will be wiser for us not to declare for 1890 more than our usual 6 per cent. dividend. I now move that the Report and Accounts be received and adopted.
