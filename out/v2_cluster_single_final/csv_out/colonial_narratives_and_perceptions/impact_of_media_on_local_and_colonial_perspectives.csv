631,"Media played a crucial role in shaping public opinion, advocating for African interests, and influencing political and social discourse during colonial times in Africa.","The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the crucial role media played in shaping public opinion, advocating for African interests, and influencing political and social discourse during colonial times in Africa. The General History of Africa highlights the significance of newspapers and radio as vital tools for disseminating nationalist and anticolonial activities, which alarmed colonial administrators. It notes the emergence of a literary culture in European languages that mobilized against colonialism, with pamphlets and newspapers serving as platforms for anti-colonial propaganda. The text also emphasizes the influence of international periodicals in spreading anti-colonial and anti-imperialist ideas and describes how early African parliamentarians strategically used the colonial language to challenge colonial narratives. Similarly, The African Times articles provide substantial evidence of media's role in advocating for native interests, exposing abuses, and promoting African welfare. The newspaper served as a platform for voicing grievances, advocating for reforms, and connecting African concerns with British public opinion, thereby influencing political discourse. It actively engaged in initiatives like the memorial for Sir John Glover and addressed issues such as the unjust treatment of British subjects by Spanish authorities. While the African Times articles do not explicitly mention the broader impact of media on colonial policies or its influence on colonial administration, they underscore the media's significant role in advocating for African interests and shaping social discourse during the colonial era. Together, these sources illustrate the media's profound impact on political and social discourse in colonial Africa.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that support the claim that media played a crucial role in shaping public opinion, advocating for African interests, and influencing political and social discourse during colonial times in Africa.

The articles highlight the African Times' efforts to advocate for native interests, expose abuses, and promote the welfare of African people. For instance, the newspaper is described as a platform for voicing grievances and advocating for reforms, such as the abolition of imprisonment for debt and the recognition of African warriors' contributions. The articles also emphasize the paper's role in connecting African concerns with British public opinion, thereby influencing political discourse. Additionally, the African Times is portrayed as a medium for mobilizing support for initiatives like the memorial for Sir John Glover and addressing issues like the unjust treatment of British subjects by Spanish authorities. These examples illustrate the newspaper's active engagement in advocating for African interests and shaping public opinion, aligning with the claim. However, the articles do not explicitly mention the broader impact of media on colonial policies or the extent of its influence on the colonial administration, which could be seen as a difference from the claim.

To that extent, they were a constant source of worry for colonial administrators as the various sedition laws of the mid-i93os and the attempts to establish iron curtains by legislation against certain publications show. The spread of the radio later made the repressive measures which colonial rulers adopted to screen away their colonies from external influences more difficult and less effective.\nAs has been emphasized, constitutionalism, and the use of newspapers and radio as media of expression, were dependent on the availability of legislative institutions in the colonies or the hope of having them, as well as the existence of a significant number of western-educated Africans who could make appropriate use of such institutions and organs of expression. Also, the approach of the western-educated African nationalists pre› supposed the acceptance of Western European models of political develop› ment such as nationalists without their experience could not appreciate. Uneven spread of education was, therefore, an important variable in the expression of African nationalism and anti-colonial politics. As European powers concentrated on making colonies pay for their administration and services, relatively little was done to spread western education and provide infrastructure for political and social development. In several areas of colonized Africa between the two world wars, primary schools were still few and far between and secondary education was a rarity. In British Central Africa, French Equatorial Africa, Soudan and Portuguese Angola, Mozambique and Guinea, there was practically no access to secondary education before the Second World War.

It is a sad reflection that, in many cases, European commerce has left its African customer as naked as it found him ... they will never secure a footing in Africa for their ideas of civilization, until the commercial relations between the high-toned, enlightened European and the 'savage' African, are placed upon a more equitable basis. But so long as demijohn follows demijohn of rum ... no reinforcements of missionaries and no homilies from professional philanthropists, on the blessing of European civilization will avail anything. 43 An ardent campaigner for Africa-oriented educational reforms, Grant, deeply influenced by Blyden, sought an educational system which had the university at its apex but only as an institution which was designed to provide research and teaching in fields related to Africa, as opposed to the 'conventional literary education which emphasized European culture and values'.

The fact was that for the non-Muslim areas of Africa probably the most important single innovation of foreign rule was literacy. Even for the Islamized areas, the coming of literacy in the Roman script gave a new impetus to Muslim education. Literacy was for many African peoples a new magic, and was sought after as such and at all costs since it appeared to open the treasure house of the modern world. To know the amount of power, authority and influence which the first generation of African clerks, interpreters and teachers exercised is to have some idea of the spell which literacy cast over many African peoples.

What was true in 1976 can be seen as having been even more commonplace in that more dramatic period of external domina› tion in Africa, when an entire people, its social organizations, and its economic and artistic patterns became subjugated to strategies for maximum exploitation by outside interests. The slave trade had intensified internecine warfare for over two centuries, leading to cultural devastation on an unprecedented scale. Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent. Different methods of foreign control or interaction with the African populace naturally evoked or created different cultural responses from the displaced African. Belgian and Portuguese colonialism, as well as British settler colonialism in East Africa, are easily recognized as the most ruthless on the continent. They created conditions for the truly displaced African in the most literal sense of the word. The Arabic dimension was unique in its own right, an ambivalent face of expansionism which none the less left strong cultural impressions on the landscape.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The significance of colonialism for Africa', 'content': ""Finally, in the social field, the significance of colonialism here is clearly a mixed one.

Secondly, the new classes created by colonialism and 'founded on western criteria of schooling and civilization, instead of on the African criteria of wealth and prestige'$^{57}$ are bound to remain and in fact increase in complexity. Already, two new groups have been added since independence. One is the political elite made up of the leading members of the political parties that have been mushrooming in Africa and who have become the prime ministers, presidents, ministers, ambassadors, etc. The other is the military elite made up of present and ex-officers of the armed forces of each independent state. The members of these elite groups are definitely different from the people of the rural areas in terms of their dress, life style, tastes and status. Now, had these elite groups constituted a good percentage of the population of Africa, one would have accepted their formation as yet another crucial and fundamental change introduced by colonialism. But as indicated already, the urban or elitist groups constituted by the end of the colonial era only a small fraction of the population, at most about 20%. The remaining people were the rural dwellers who remained predominantly illiterate and maintained their traditional beliefs, values and standards. Indeed, such civilization or socialization that colonial› ism introduced was essentially an urban phenomenon, and did not really affect the rural people, and, since the latter constitute the overwhelming majority of the population of every African state, we can safely and reason› ably conclude that the colonial impact here, interesting as it is, was extremely limited."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""Another important but negative political impact of colonialism was the weakening of the indigenous systems of government. In the first place, as S. Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years.

The colonial powers provided the infrastructure on which progress in the 'independence' period has depended: a fairly efficient administrative machine, reach› ing down to villages in the most remote areas; a network of roads and railways; and basic services in health and education.

The first important beneficial social effect was the overall increase of the population of Africa during the colonial period by about 37.5%, as J. C. Caldwell has shown (Chapter 18), after its decline during the first two or three decades of colonialism. This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization. As A. E. Afigbo has emphasized (Chapter 19), urban› ization was of course not unknown in pre-colonial Africa. The kingdoms and empires of Africa had such capitals or political centres as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, Gao and Great Zimbabwe; such commercial centres as Kano, Jenne, Sofala and Malindi, and such educational centres as Timbuktu, Cairo and Fez. But there is no doubt that as a result of colonial› ism, the pace of urbanization was greatly accelerated.

Why, if you think your friends and brethren are manifesting a disloyal spirit, is it not your place to go and talk to them? If you are afraid to do it publicly, can\'t you see this or that person having hand in it and lay things before him? Instead of this, you show a good face to both sides. This would never civilise your country. There is no excuse whatever for you.

It has been crowded out of our columns by other matter of pressing importance; but as we are still waiting for H. M. Government\'s approval of the constitution of the Fanti Confederation, while its enemies are busy at work, we are glad to have now found room for its insertion.\n\nOur contemporary, *Vanity Fair*, has found a formidable rival in the matter of caricatures, where it could least have expected to meet one—a rival which unites practical usefulness with its sly humour, and provides with facts as well as with fancy. The Illustrative Portrait Groups, by means of which the well-known tailors, Samuel Brothers, instruct the world how to measure itself, and to choose its garments, are really very ingenious pieces of chaff in their way, and contain an amount of quiet fun which one does not usually look for in trade handbooks. The device consists in portraying some forty public characters as lay-figures, to display various frock-coats, reefers, and Chesterfields, whilst the fun lies in the manner in which the models are chosen for insertion into the different suits. Thus, the Hon. Acton Smee Ayrton is exhibited in a ""smart"" overcoat, resembling that of a fashionable Hansom cabdriver, whilst our bland and foppish Premier is, of course, to be seen in that frock-dress-suit which one associates with the ceremony of marriage. When we noted the name of Mr. Disraeli amongst these dummies, we wondered what the joke would be here, and soon discovered that the ingenious artist had clad the great Conservative magician in an oriental dressing-gown at 25s. The same crafty hand has turned the familiar high-collared coat of the Earl of Derby into a knickerbocker suit, and has given to the cheerful Robert Lowe a garment which is described as ""a favourite style with stout gentlemen."" Curiously enough, however, the enterprise of Messrs. Samuel has not supplied us with the name of the distingué-looking groom, whose likeness concludes this interesting series. Altogether, it would seem that the art of the tailor, when transferred to paper, is a very amusing one indeed.—*Figaro.*'}, {'id': 2324, 'article_title': 'Complaint from Fernando Po', 'full_section_title': 'Complaint from Fernando Po', 'last_edit_date': '08-29-1872', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1872#article-11', 'issue_date': '23_10_1872', 'content': 'Sir,—I have now taken up my pen to inform you of the inhuman and unjust way in which British subjects are treated here by the Spanish authorities.\n\nIf I should say to an Englishman that he could be locked up in prison for no fault whatever, and without trial, for an unlimited space of time, it would appear to be an incredible falsehood; but, Sir, I must assure you it is the truth here, and the British Consul never interferes in any way whatever; in fact, he is never to be found in this island excepting by chance.

In due time this invitation to Berlin was issued, and accepted by all the European Powers who were signatories to the Treaty of Paris. The Council was summoned to meet on the 13th June, and on that day it duly assembled at the Old Radziwill Palace, in Berlin, which has been recently restored and fitted as a residence for Prince Bismarck. To the great astonishment of the majority of the British people, it was first rumoured, and subsequently officially announced, that the British Plenipotentiaries were to be the Premier, the Earl of Beaconsfield, and the Marquis of Salisbury, Her Majesty\'s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to be assisted by Lord Odo Russell, the British Ambassador at the German Court. The unadvisability of the simultaneous absence from London of the Premier and the Foreign Secretary, and that during the sitting of Parliament, was justly and freely animadverted upon even by some of the deeply pledged adherents of the Ministry on the Eastern Question; while, on the other hand, it was almost asserted that so much of a mutual understanding between the divers European Courts had been arrived at, that the entire work of the Council would probably be concluded in three or four sittings, and Great Britain have back her Premier, chaplet on brow, to be displaced only by a ducal coronet that should adorn his distinguished head, and realize, we may suppose, the loftiest height of his ambitious dreams. The Plenipotentiaries meet, as proposed, on the 13th June. On the 14th, the Globe, an evening paper, came out in London with certain columns headed ""Full Text of the Anglo-Russian Agreement,"" the details of which in English and in the original French, and signed ""Schouvaloff"" and ""Salisbury,"" it prefaced with the following words: ""The Berlin Congress having assembled, there is no longer any reason for our withholding the full text of the agreement between the Governments of England and Russia, signed at the Foreign Office on the 30th May,"" &c., &c. This publication, seemingly considered opportune by the editor of a paper which had always supported the Beaconsfield Cabinet on the Eastern Question, was regarded as the very adverse of opportune by the members of that Cabinet. Great trouble was in the camp of the Ministerial and War party; and it seemed almost as if with the latter the Earl of Beaconsfield had become ""the demon"" instead of ""the quasi-divine."" And yet although ""the independence and integrity of the Ottoman Empire"" was no longer to be a stumbling-block in the way of pacific arrangement, the agreement manifested a full determination on the part of the British Cabinet to uphold to the fullest extent that might be possible pacifically, a Turkish Empire in Europe.'}, {'id': 5360, 'article_title': 'THE LATE GOVERNOR GLOVER.', 'full_section_title': 'THE LATE GOVERNOR GLOVER.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1886#article-13', 'issue_date': '01_04_1886', 'content': '### THE LATE GOVERNOR GLOVER.\n\nA special representative meeting in connexion with Sir John Glover\'s Memorial was held at the Court Hall, Lagos, on January 20th, when there were present: The Rev.

Beyond this, any donations to the ""African Times"" to assist the Editor in his responsible task, will be thankfully acknowledged in the columns of this journal.\n\nThe change in the heading of our paper, and in other portions of it, will show our subscribers that this journal now stands unfettered by any nominal, and, as circumstances have proved, precarious support of a society. The African-Aid Society has, in point of fact, absolutely ceased to exist, though it was not in any way in pecuniary difficulties, but possessed a considerable surplus.

During that period the whole of the anxiety, labour, and responsibility, both public and pecuniary, which it has involved, have been borne by one individual, the Editor. When first started, he undertook, subject to the condition of a certain number of copies being subscribed for individually by some members of the Council of the African-Aid Society, that it should never involve that society in any pecuniary loss or responsibility. Contrary to his opinion as to the conditions under which a public journal could be successfully conducted, and submitted to by him solely with the object of facilitating its establishment, a committee of a few members of the council of that society was appointed to meet monthly, prior to its publication, for considering the articles, &c., which the Editor had decided to insert. But to this the Editor attached a stipulation that he would not consent to any alterations of which he did not himself fully approve, and which he did not consider advisable or innocuous. Such a committee of course could not work, and the Editor freed himself almost immediately from the nominal restriction, which only served to increase the difficulty of bringing out the paper on the proper day, without effecting any useful purpose whatever. A perfect and entire independence of thought and opinion in the editor is essential to the success of any and every public journal. During five years, therefore, the whole labour and responsibility have, as before stated, rested with one individual, the present Editor. Such an anniversary as this is therefore a solemn one with us. The objects the Editor has endeavoured ever to keep in view have been the promotion of good government in the British African colonies and settlements, to force a removal of official abuses, to promote material development and increased facilities of transit and trade, as auxiliaries to missionary effort, and as indispensable, not to the reception of Christianity, but to the existence and spread of Christian civilization in Africa. Having entered upon this work with a deep sense of responsibility to God, we feel bound to ask ourselves how that work has been performed. With the measure and extent of its success we have nothing to do, that we leave in the hands of Him who worketh through individual agencies on the earth, according to His own infinite wisdom. But have we done our duty by the African people, and have they, on their side, done their duty towards us? As regards the former, we can only look to our motives and our desires. We have endeavoured to keep a watchful guard over ourselves as ""one who must give an account before God,"" and we have, with no small sacrifice of time and rest, conscientiously striven to give to Africa in our labours whatever talent or wisdom God may have bestowed upon us for that purpose. As regards the latter, we think we have cause of rejoicing rather than of complaint. The number of our African subscribers has continuously increased, filling up, in a way most satisfactory to us, the gaps in our subscription list caused by the withdrawals of those of our early friends who considered, we suppose, that no further effort on their part was necessary to our support. And we have given a voice—a public voice to Africa. Few people in England, unfortunately, care much about her or her concerns. The English Anti-Slavery party, fully occupied in their high and noble object of the eradication of negro slavery everywhere, have not yet had time generally to recognise the importance of paving the way, and preparing for, and aiding in the work of Christian civilization in Africa itself.

But there is no engagement to continue to furnish such a quantity monthly, although the intention is to do so if the funds will allow. The paper is edited and conducted gratuitously; and all that can be obtained from the sale of copies and from advertisements is devoted to its improvement and enlargement. But unless a special fund were raised for the paper the Editor cannot risk loss. Eight pages of the size now issued are nearly equal to twelve of the previous size. The Editor hopes, however, by the blessing of God, to maintain the issue at twelve, and even at sixteen pages of the new and increased size. Subscribers may aid in this by obtaining ADVERTISEMENTS and other SUBSCRIBERS for the journal, without which it cannot be accomplished. They should bear in mind that although their five shillings per annum per copy, including postage or delivery, is a shilling or two a-year dearer than some other journals of a similar size and paper are supplied at, the AFRICAN TIMES is a special paper, that will only be taken by a special class of readers—that it cannot hope to be popularised into cheapness except as education and civilization progress on the West Coast of Africa—and that in return for that individual sacrifice of a shilling or two a-year the Editor gives time, anxiety, and such little talent as he may possess, without any reward, save the hope that he may be in some measure advancing the great cause of Christian civilization and industrial development in Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1865#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE RIVER GAMBIA COLONY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When an editor sets honestly about the correction of abuses that may have become strong by time and impunity, his path must necessarily be a thorny one. A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

The political interest must also not be lost sight of. In the event of political troubles in the East, it is quite conceivable that England may have to revert to the old route round the Cape of Good Hope in order to communicate with her Eastern colonies; and then the possession of strong and prosperous settlements on the Western Coast of Africa would be of incalculable advantage to her. We say, without fear of contradiction, that the formation of a railway connecting our chief possessions on the Coast, and which would be available at certain points to tap the Interior, would confer a vast benefit upon Native and European alike. Hitherto in only too many cases the contact of these two classes with each other has had a most injurious effect upon both. It is said that no matter how industrious and intelligent a European may be at home, no sooner does he find himself in West Africa than he becomes thoroughly demoralized; while the Native readily develops a fancy for strong drink that soon renders him unfit for the serious business of life.

They protested against the brutal methods used by African sepÆis to recruit forced labour, the low wages and poor working conditions of the chíbalo labourers and the arbitrary and capricious actions of the European overseers. The editors were particularly incensed by the common practice of seizing 'African women to repair and construct roads, not even supplying them with food nor paying them a salary', while 'forcing them during the rainy season to sleep in mud-huts, beside the road, like slaves'. 105 The newspapers also unleashed a broadside attack on the conditions of employment of free African workers. They deplored the fact that peasants and nominally free agricultural workers were compelled to work on Euro› pean estates 'from sunrise until sunset earning hardly a shilling a month', that Mozambicans working in the South African mines are 'denied the right to select their own employers ... and die like flies in the mines', that African workers are arrested and beaten if they lack proper identifica› tion, and that the state used chíbalo labourers to break strikes and drive down wages of free workers.$^{106}$ The informal colour bar conventions, which froze Africans in the lowest paying jobs while reserving the most desirable employment for Europeans, was also the target of several editorials."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': 'Literature in European languages', 'content': ""Literary culture in European languages in West and Central Africa may be said to have constituted the highest force of colonial confrontation.

Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings.

Within a matter of only some forty-five years from 1935, the colonial system had been uprooted from over 90% of Africa and confined only to that part of the continent south of the Limpopo River. That is to say, colonial› ism lasted in most parts of Africa for under a hundred years, indeed from the 1880s to the 1960s. In the history of a people and a whole continent, this is a very brief span indeed.

First, what legacies did colonialism bequeath to Africa, or what impact did it make on Africa? The second question is, in view of this impact or balance sheet, what is the significance of colonialism for Africa? Does it constitute a revolutionary or important episode in the history of the continent? Was it a major break with the past of the continent, or was it, after all, a mere passing event which did not constitute a break in the history of the continent? Or as L. H.

There is no doubt that in the economic field, the colonial impact was by and large decisive and fundamental and affected both the rural and urban areas. In virtually all parts of Africa, the money economy had become the rule rather than the exception by the end of the colonial period and status even in the rural areas was being assessed not only in terms of birth and number of wives and children but also in terms of cash and the quantity of cash crops that one was producing each season. Further› more, with the introduction of cash crops, land assumed a value that it had not had in pre-colonial days while individual effort and achievement came to be regarded far more than the communalism of the traditional order. The African economy also became integrated deeper into the world economy in general and the capitalist economy in particular than before and this had effects that can probably never be undone. Unfortunately, this integration was effected in a very disadvantageous and exploitative manner for Africa and not even twenty years of independence have funda› mentally altered the situation which has now become known as neo› colonialism."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading. One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority. Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust.

There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years.

During that period the whole of the anxiety, labour, and responsibility, both public and pecuniary, which it has involved, have been borne by one individual, the Editor. When first started, he undertook, subject to the condition of a certain number of copies being subscribed for individually by some members of the Council of the African-Aid Society, that it should never involve that society in any pecuniary loss or responsibility. Contrary to his opinion as to the conditions under which a public journal could be successfully conducted, and submitted to by him solely with the object of facilitating its establishment, a committee of a few members of the council of that society was appointed to meet monthly, prior to its publication, for considering the articles, &c., which the Editor had decided to insert. But to this the Editor attached a stipulation that he would not consent to any alterations of which he did not himself fully approve, and which he did not consider advisable or innocuous. Such a committee of course could not work, and the Editor freed himself almost immediately from the nominal restriction, which only served to increase the difficulty of bringing out the paper on the proper day, without effecting any useful purpose whatever. A perfect and entire independence of thought and opinion in the editor is essential to the success of any and every public journal. During five years, therefore, the whole labour and responsibility have, as before stated, rested with one individual, the present Editor. Such an anniversary as this is therefore a solemn one with us. The objects the Editor has endeavoured ever to keep in view have been the promotion of good government in the British African colonies and settlements, to force a removal of official abuses, to promote material development and increased facilities of transit and trade, as auxiliaries to missionary effort, and as indispensable, not to the reception of Christianity, but to the existence and spread of Christian civilization in Africa. Having entered upon this work with a deep sense of responsibility to God, we feel bound to ask ourselves how that work has been performed. With the measure and extent of its success we have nothing to do, that we leave in the hands of Him who worketh through individual agencies on the earth, according to His own infinite wisdom. But have we done our duty by the African people, and have they, on their side, done their duty towards us? As regards the former, we can only look to our motives and our desires. We have endeavoured to keep a watchful guard over ourselves as ""one who must give an account before God,"" and we have, with no small sacrifice of time and rest, conscientiously striven to give to Africa in our labours whatever talent or wisdom God may have bestowed upon us for that purpose. As regards the latter, we think we have cause of rejoicing rather than of complaint. The number of our African subscribers has continuously increased, filling up, in a way most satisfactory to us, the gaps in our subscription list caused by the withdrawals of those of our early friends who considered, we suppose, that no further effort on their part was necessary to our support. And we have given a voice—a public voice to Africa. Few people in England, unfortunately, care much about her or her concerns. The English Anti-Slavery party, fully occupied in their high and noble object of the eradication of negro slavery everywhere, have not yet had time generally to recognise the importance of paving the way, and preparing for, and aiding in the work of Christian civilization in Africa itself.

You will be delighted to hear that your advocacy of native rights is beginning to make itself felt, and that things begin to assume a more cheerful aspect. With the departure of Governor Blackall and our jury destroying ex-Chief Justice Carr, the spirit of public confidence, so essential to the advancement of a people, appears to visit us. The Judicial Bench, with one melancholy and deplor- able exception, never had so high a position as at the present under Chief Justice French; and it is rumoured that Sir Arthur Kennedy, our excellent Governor-in-Chief, will infuse the genius of a complete reform and regeneration into every department of the State. You may rely upon one thing at least, that such out- rages upon the persons of natives as the English Parliament was dishonoured by the recital of during last session never will occur upon this coast again. Sir Arthur Kennedy has established competitive examinations here, and by this step has, like a wise ruler, adopted the recognised spirit of the age and given an earnest proof of a sincere desire to see the loyal, industrious, and creditable natives advanced to places of position and trust.

Nothing will do more to create an efficient staff of officials, to purify the public service, and deal a heavy death-blow against nepotism than this system of competitive examination; and the country owes a lasting debt of gratitude to his Excellency the Governor-in-Chief for the introduction of this system into our rising settlement. One of the worst evils attendant, too, upon such miserable appointments as those to which I allude as having been made by ex-Governor Blackall, is that the officials immediately bring a perfect brood of equally incompetent persons around them in the shape of relatives and friends, and the public service goes to complete and absolute ruin.\n\nThis is a subject of such vital importance, namely, the bestowal of Government appointments to the natives of Sierra Leone, that as soon as the great pressure of professional business admits of the opportunity, I will do myself the honour of addressing you at greater length upon it.—I am, Mr. Editor, yours truly,  \nW.

During eight years we have endeavoured to advocate in its columns, honestly, temperately, and fearlessly, the true interests of the West African countries, their people, and the merchants engaged in commerce with them. Great changes have taken place since the issue of the African Times commenced. The slave trade, which was then carrying off victims from the coasts of Dahomey and from the Congo, seems now to be entirely at an end, we hope and believe never to be again revived. At that period there was steam communication once a month between Liverpool and the West Coast ports; now, thanks to the establishment of the new line, there are four steam vessels to be despatched per month. This last important change ought to operate as a powerful stimulus to production and commerce, giving, as it will, so much greater facilities to the native traders to utilise their comparatively small capital in direct operation with Great Britain. With regard to the British settlements, trade and commerce cannot be expected to take their due development, until those administrative and judicial abuses which have been and will continue to be exposed and denounced by us shall have ceased. It cannot be said that life and property are safe in them while the authorities, executive and judicial, are guilty of the most illegal and arbitrary acts, and are allowed by the Colonial-office to perpetrate such acts with impunity instead of being immediately cashiered for them. But since this inclination on the part of the Home Government to throw the shield of its protection over culpable officials, rather than over the people among whom they exercise authority in its name, does unhappily exist, as recent facts most incontestably prove, it only becomes the more indispensable to create and organise a public opinion in the British settlements on the Coast that shall be powerful enough to secure for the governed a due attention to their grievances by Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, and prompt redress at his hands. To this creation and organisation of an African public opinion our most strenuous efforts will be directed in the future, as they have been incessantly in the past; and looking at what we have done in this direction during the past eight years, we think we are justified in demanding a much more liberal support from all classes on the West Coast of Africa than we have hitherto received. We have endeavoured conscientiously and zealously, without fear or favour, to carry on the work which God has put it into our hearts and hands to do, and has therefore charged us with; and those for whose present protection and permanent interests we labour have a duty also to perform towards us.

It appears that when the African Times reached those places, the Cavalla and Rocktown people comprehended at once the danger in which they stood of the visit of a British ship of war, and sent back the wretched captives to their homes.

Should the peace written of as likely to be restored between the people of those towns be also established as a further fruit of our labours, such a result will give us an added pleasure. We know that when the present estimable President of the Republic became convinced that the report given by us of the atrocious treatment of those poor women was substantially correct, he became very anxious to obtain their liberation, in which, however, he had great difficulties to contend with, in consequence of the unjustifiable and disgraceful opposition of the Cape Palmas Americans to his Government.

Take this as an instance: That well-known captain of the African Steamship Company who is styled ""The Hater of Africans"" (for every one knows him to be so) was on his way last voyage to the southern ports, and, as is always the case, anchored off Fernando Po. The consignees went on board, their cox and boatswains, sailors of H.M.S. Pert, and passengers, &c. The language of the captain that day was rather sharp, for I took a minute of it verbatim, as follows: ""Had I known that so many of these black fellows would have come on board I might have passed off to south before calling here."" He then ordered one of his boats to be lowered, and went on shore. What a shame and disgrace to a man occupying so high a position! However, before he went on shore, as his words...\n\nwere thrown like dice on the table, so it was retaliated to him as follows: ""If you don\'t wish to see all these black fellows, you ought to have sat at home, and not come cruising all along the towns and islands of Africa."" Suppose that steamer was an African\'s (and I believe they could now afford one), and an increase, say from 20 to 25 per cent. be made to his wages, then he would rather work for an African than a European. He worked for nothing else save his money. To him as well as to all such, I ask, Where were ye when the Rev. S. Crowther, Bishop for the Bights of Benin and Biafra, was ordained?

We can only further write a few words in reply. We neither hoped nor expected to work a moral change in those of whom they write. An old Persian aphorism says, ""You may feed a snake upon violets, and lull him to sleep upon roseleaves, but he will produce nothing but poison."" So it is with some human beings. In what we did for them and theirs in vindication of great principles, we did not look for attachment or reward. If it had come to us, we should have accepted it and been grateful for it; but we were never disappointed in its not coming. If we had the power to give them personal benefits, beyond what they are receiving from our official enemies of whom they make themselves subservient tools, they would become at once loud-tongued and strong-penned adherents. But as this cannot be, they follow their natural instincts. The time may come when they may be victims of some flagrant abuse of power, some disgraceful injustice, some odious wrong. Then they will find us at their side, and using all our influence in their behalf; not for their own sakes personally, but because of the principle involved. We know nothing but this, and the welfare of Africa, and honour of England as connected with it; and wherever and whenever one of those great principles which it has been our duty and glory to defend and vindicate, is or may be in our opinion violated in the person or property of any man on the West Coast, however vile or unworthy he may be, we shall as heretofore do battle in his behalf, as though he were our dearest friend and the most admirable of the human race.\n\n---'}, {'id': 2197, 'article_title': 'NOTE ACCOMPANYING LAGOS LETTERS', 'full_section_title': 'NOTE ACCOMPANYING LAGOS LETTERS', 'last_edit_date': '03-06-1872', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1872#article-8', 'issue_date': '23_04_1872', 'content': 'Lagos, March 6, 1872.\n\nMy dear Sir,—Accept many and unfeigned thanks from the Africans for your kindness towards us.

We see no reason why we should not continue to do so. God has this year blessed our efforts by making them visibly instrumental to great good. When we think of the arbitrary errors of a Salmon and a Glover—of what might have been the fate of the Fanti Confederation and its oppressed officials—what might have been the fate of the bulk of those connected with the trade and commerce of Lagos but for our persistent interference in their behalf,—we do indeed rejoice at having continued this work for the good of Africa and her people. We enter, therefore, on this our twelfth year, rich in hope, and not poor in joy. Not that our subscribers pay better than they did. Never have we received so little from them as during the past year; for, to the shame of but too many of them be it said, paying is the very last thing they would seem to think of. There are good and even noble exceptions; but these are, alas! very few. To them we tender our congratulation that they comprehend and appreciate our labours for African advancement, and their own duties and obligations. We want all their aid in every way. Every educated and God-loving African has weighty duties resting upon him. He has been brought out from the mass of heathen superstition and abasement, not through any effort of his own, but under the good providence of God, by the noble and disinterested efforts of others; and this, not only for his own present and eternal good, but that he may be an instrument of good to others, who yet remain entangled by the filth and ignorance of those fiendish idolatries, which have made Africa an object of so much compassionate grief to Christian people. And Christian enlightenment ought also to bring with it a love of country; stimulating to noble and patriotic efforts to do everything possible to free it from all that is evil and degrading. Our efforts in demanding better government for the West African Settlements, and the removal of abuses there, are directed only against such things; and no Christian African ought to allow himself to be seduced by paltry pecuniary or other yet more empty considerations, into becoming an abettor, defender, and supporter of them. God helping and strengthening us, we shall not relax in our efforts; and we hope, year by year, to have to welcome new and ardent fellow-workers among the Africans themselves, and to rejoice in new successes.""}, {'id': 2321, 'article_title': 'Another Letter from Livingstone', 'full_section_title': 'Another Letter from Livingstone', 'last_edit_date': '08-28-1872', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1872#article-8', 'issue_date': '23_10_1872', 'content': 'Sir,—We cannot allow 1871 to pass away without expressing our gratefulness and high appreciation of the philanthropic feelings by which you are impelled to advocate the cause of Africa and her injured myriads from beneath the lash of official tyranny and oppression, and from the taunts, scoffs, and political venom of the negro-haters.

We say, without hesitation, that with or without an Ashanti invasion, such a result was inevitable, after the attention which we have drawn to the subject for years past, and especially since December, 1871, in our communications to Her Majesty\'s Government, in the press, and through our friends in Parliament. The situation had become disgracefully absurd, as well as unjust—such, in fact, as no Government having any pretensions to wisdom and equity, could continue to uphold in face of the damaging revelations which Mr. Acting-Administrator Salomon\'s crass official stupidity gave us an opportunity of making. The papers laid before Parliament are not all that we could have desired, though personally we have reason to be satisfied with them. No one who reads them can doubt for a single moment that it was we who made it impossible for Earl Kimberley to sanction, however he might endeavour on official grounds to extenuate, Mr. Salomon\'s insane proceedings. Earl Kimberley was able to read Mr. Salomon\'s officially untruthful and abused despatches in justification of his most indefensible proceedings, as regards the members of the Fanti confederation, and the not less fatuous and unstatesmanlike adoption of them by Sir Arthur Kennedy, in the clear light afforded by our letter to him of the 2nd January, 1871, and its enclosures. We have read very attentively Earl Kimberley\'s despatch of the 16th January. Earl Kimberley did not forward our letter of the 2nd and its enclosures to the Coast until one day later than the above, to go out by the same steamer on the 18th. The more we consider its contents (see page 133 of the present number of the African Times), the more firmly we are persuaded that Mr. Salomon was only saved from merited reprimand and recall by the stupid adoption of his views and his acts by his patron, Sir Arthur Kennedy. It would have been too much to ask that not only an Acting-Administrator, but a Governor-in-Chief also, should be disgraced for the sake of a people so poor and so dependent as the Fantis. Nevertheless, Mr. Salomon was not let off without serious expressions of disapproval, a full share of which, as the despatch was to Sir Arthur Kennedy, devolved incidentally upon him. Earl Kimberley regrets the arrests should have been made, and ordered what we had urged on his lordship to order—that the parties should be released from their bail, and that no proceedings whatever should be taken against them in the Assessor\'s Court. His lordship thinks that ""the Administrator might have confined himself to issuing a proclamation warning British subjects from taking office under the Confederation until the articles had been approved by Her Majesty\'s Government, as Her Majesty\'s Government have no wish to discourage any legitimate efforts on the part of the Fanti kings and chiefs to establish for themselves an improved form of Government,"" &c., &c., &c. We pity Lord Kimberley in being fettered by official considerations from writing with the indignation he evidently felt, and from the expression of which he with difficulty restrained himself, which makes the excuses he admits for Mr. Salomon\'s conduct, and by implication for that of Sir Arthur Kennedy, perplexingly lame and inconclusive. We shall return again to these despatches, and the unwarrantable and unfounded assertions contained in those of Mr. Salomon and Sir Arthur Kennedy. Meanwhile, we think it our duty to ourselves to draw attention to the evidence which these papers afford of the inappreciable advantages derived from the African Times and its editor by the West Coast people—in this instance, the Fanti kings, chiefs, and nation, and the educated Africans who took part in and directed the national aspirations for an effective organization which should secure their country from the horrors of Ashanti invasion, and facilitate that development of its enormous natural resources, without which all other efforts to promote the civilization of its people would be futile. If ever there be a great Fanti united nation, educated, civilized, self-governed, rich, and happy—and we feel in our inmost soul that there will be such a nation—the African Times and its officially much-abused editor will, we venture to hope, be acknowledged as having greatly stimulated the national movement, and influenced the adoption by Her Majesty\'s Government of those measures, whatever they may be, which will have led to results so much to be desired.'}, {'id': 3308, 'article_title': 'THE POLICE OF LAGOS', 'full_section_title': 'THE POLICE OF LAGOS', 'last_edit_date': '01-18-1877', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1877#article-10', 'issue_date': '01_03_1877', 'content': 'Sir,—Just a few words about the Lagos Police, and the manner in which its operations are guided by the Government. This is a subject of great importance, especially when it is considered that it must be mainly owing to the exertions of a police, under judicious and well-defined regulations, that crimes can be brought to the notice of the authorities and punished. In the absence of such regulations, the name and office of police are mere mockeries. We deeply regret, then, to state that, literally speaking, there is not a single written rule for the guidance of the Lagos police. Some time in 1869 a few directions were put in writing by the then Superintendent, but it is believed these were mere private memoranda for his own guidance, for they were neither signed by him nor sanctioned by the then Administrator; consequently, the succeeding Superintendents have never been able safely to use them as official. Further, not even when peculiar exigencies in the colony need special rules for their treatment, do the police have these supplied to them. This state of things greatly hinders the efficient working of the police scheme in Lagos, and has many a time put matters in great confusion—e.g., when your October issue appeared with a letter condemning the apathy of the Lagos Government on the question of domestic slavery in Lagos, carried on under the Administrator\'s very nose, general orders were issued from Government House for the police to be on the alert to bring slave-dealers to justice. There being no special rule as to how this was to be done, or on what grounds the police were to apprehend people, or how they were to prosecute them, and nine-tenths of them being illiterate men, great confusion took place. The Administrator himself was at a loss how to manage to get certain arrested parties convicted, without incurring the displeasure of his friend and confidante, Chief (?) Taiwo; and the Acting Stipendiary Magistrate (Mr. C. D. Turton) and the Superintendent of Police were threatened by one Monsieur Callamand with a law-suit if they did not prove against him the charge of slave-dealing, for which he had been summoned to the Police-court. All these things prove the absolute necessity there exists for established rules to guide the police in their action; for, had there been such, his Excellency would have known at once how to have acted in the matter, instead of sending for remanded prisoners from the House of Correction, and assembling them before Chief (?) Taiwo, to tell them they were free. The Superintendent of Police, too, did not know what he was taking a summons against Callamand for; hence he narrowly escaped having a law-suit about his ears. Moreover, this state of things lessens the authority of the police, and renders nearly abortive their exertions to maintain ordinary peace; for when once the people of Lagos think that Taiwo\'s influence with Mr. Dumaresq is sufficient to free them from the hands of the police, there is no knowing what amount of mischief they will do. But for the African Times, we say,—but for your able leader in the November issue on the subject of Lagos slave-dealers, at this time there would be seen about in the streets of Lagos slave-dealers asking those they meet, ""You want buy man?"" You see, Mr. Editor, the good the African Times is doing here for us. We thank God for its existence; we hope, also, that you will long live (never despairing) to edit and issue the African Times, bringing to light those monstrous evils perpetrated about our coast.'}, {'id': 3796, 'article_title': 'THE REPRESENTATIVE FUND', 'full_section_title': 'THE REPRESENTATIVE FUND', 'last_edit_date': '03-10-1869', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1879#article-6', 'issue_date': '01_05_1879', 'content': 'After these nations, the young men cast a glance towards Adda and Awoonah countries, being the richest districts, although short of educated men who can feel and understand what ought to be done.

They lately fell under the British control, and are, by this time, as nursing-children. The Editor has, indeed, accomplished his duty as far as he can, in trying to bring under notice the havoc Captain Ellis, now Deputy-Sheriff at Accra, made with the poor Awoonahs, and which actions he did in virtue of their invulnerability—I mean the white officers\'—as expressed by the Editor. Can this not pave the way to the belief of the black men that they are considered fools by the white men? How can a man, after having caused a great disturbance in a country, get, in lieu of degradation, the position of a Deputy-Sheriff?

Lagos alone can stand this amount, but will not, simply because the inhabitants are spendthrifts. Lagos ought to learn something out of the quarrel between the Ibadans and Egbas, on whom I can say the prosperity of this country depends on an uninterrupted security to be enjoyed for trading operations amongst and with both peoples. Lagos cannot be advantaged in any way by the destruction of either the Egbas or Ibadans. If Lagos will undertake this enterprise of rendering a monetary help to the Editor of the African Times, I hope and believe that he will succeed in arranging a basis of reconciliation and enduring friendship between these two countries, by referring to the Home Government. This is quite natural that the keynote of civilization, peace, and prosperity in those countries must be sounded from Lagos, and ere this be done, she must adopt a distinct policy for the purpose. I do not see any secure basis on which such policy can be founded and built up, but that a pecuniary assistance be, at all events, rendered to the Editor of the African Times, who will employ his energies in bringing these furious disturbances under Her Majesty\'s notice.'}, {'id': 4572, 'article_title': 'FRENCH CLAIMS ON MADAGASCAR.

The testimony on this subject is so strong as to be absolutely conclusive. The facts, indeed, are not denied by the French Government, who will probably contend that what the planters require is simply the organization of free African labour on the indentureship system. Experience in Réunion has shown that it is impossible to secure adequate protection to imported labourers, even when the British Government, acting diplomatically as well as through its resident agents, did its best to induce the local authorities to see that justice was done. But even if the Administration in Réunion could be trusted, it would be impossible so to control the so-called immigration from Africa as to prevent it from becoming a branch of the slave-trade. Africa does not suffer from pressure of population, and there is no natural desire on the part of the people to emigrate to distant countries. At the same time, if the French determine to introduce African engagés into Réunion, the supply of labourers is certain to be equal to the demand, but this will only be by the unscrupulous action of slave-traders eager for a new and profitable market. It is said that large numbers of Sakalavas have been taken to Réunion from the North-west coast of Madagascar, but that, although a good deal has been said as to the voluntary nature of the contracts and the limited period during which the engaged labourers were to be absent from their homes, not one of them has ever been known to return. There is reason to believe that the recent proceedings of the French in Madagascar are attributable not so much to a restless spirit of aggression on the part of the French Government as to the intrigues of colonial planters, who think that under cover of the national flag they may draw a perennial supply of servile labour from the western coast of the great African island. It is satisfactory to learn that the attention of the anti-slavery party in France is being directed to this subject, and that they have resolved strenuously to oppose the revival of a system which, if sanctioned by the Government, cannot fail to bring discredit upon the Republic."" We have thought it right to call attention to this matter because some of our friends thought we should be justified, by late severe indisposition, in discontinuing the publication of The African Times.

Knowing that Lagos is an island, and possessed superior and civilized materials for destruction, no native army from the interior or in the neighbourhood thereof can ever attempt to invade her, as, from experience, we know that for every trivial matter we are fond of thrashing the natives, and, therefore, because we are strong; for it has been proved beyond doubt that when we were independent, some of our Executive were very fond of making or creating little unnecessary wars, exhibiting powers, &c., which led to Lagos being placed under Sierra Leone in 1866, to check the ambition of the local Executive. The authority to strike the blow should be in the hands of the Secretary of State, after due and faithful reports. The Governor should be above prejudice, as, from experience, we know it was this that favoured and promoted tribal feelings and jealousies from 1865, one tribe claiming to be the mouthpiece, adviser, and in the confidence of the Governor. The Governor should be above favouritism, as, from experience, it was this that led a special native trader, a favourite of the Executive, to go to the Ogun river with armed force, and there against the interests of all merchants and traders, forcibly seize all produce belonging to several innocent persons, in satisfaction of debt due to him by the Egbas; which policy the then Executive encouraged, sanctioned, and favoured, and the Colonial Secretary dissented from, and for which he was tried in Council, and suspended, to please a favourite political intriguer. The Governor should discourage all gossiping and tale-bearing gentlemen (professedly) and others, who, taking advantage of gaining the Executive ears, injure innocent officials, and, without a proper hearing, dismissing them, to please Mr. So-and-so. Consequently the power of dismissal should be in the hands of the Secretary of State. The Governor should permit every Member of Council to express his opinion independently, and not to please him or simply concur, otherwise to mark him out for ruin.

We have throughout our editorial career earnestly endeavoured to perform this duty—not with so much success as we could have desired. Government servants, from the highest to the lowest, in Crown Colonies form a serried phalanx that it is difficult for any assailant to penetrate. There is an _esprit de corps_, from the lowest grade of European Crown Colony officials up to and including Downing-street, that has made it almost a superhuman task to procure redress for a wrong committed by the Executive of a Crown Colony. We have had but too much experience of this, our rebuffs having been such that nothing but a full conviction of our being right could have prevented our writing ourselves down as assininely incompetent to distinguish between good and evil, between right and wrong, between even-handed justice and flagrant oppression. Such has been the past in our editorial career. We fancy that we now see a gleam of light justifying in us a hope of better things to come. Some changes that have taken place at the Gambia, attributed to our efforts, are encouraging, as evidencing that the ear and judgment of the present Chief of the Colonial Office, the Earl of Kimberley, are not entirely monopolized by officialism; and in ruminating on the letter which we inserted in our last number, headed ""The African Kings Transported by the late Governor Ussher,"" we have ventured to indulge the hope that if the noble Secretary of State for the Colonies will only admit that the decisions and acts of the Governors of Crown Colonies are not infallible, we may yet obtain some atonement for injustice to some deeply injured persons.

We are not about to praise ourselves for anything that we have done in this work which God has committed to us. Do what we may in His cause, we must still be ""unprofitable servants."" We have, however, heartily endeavoured to do our duty; and we have been strengthened by the assurances given to us by those who are not enlisted against us by their errors or their vices, that our labours have been productive of great good. The manifold abuses and evils that still exist—the little progress towards Christian civilization and the development of the vast material resources that has yet been made, the hand-to-mouth system of administration which contents itself with to-day, and the absence of all fixed principles and definite purpose in government as regards the future, with the persistent and so far successful efforts lately made so to re-arrange the administration of justice as to secure impunity to the powerful official wrongdoer, and to withdraw protection from the defenceless and the weak, show us, however, but too plainly how small a proportion the *what has been done* bears to the *what there is still to do.* We feel what an absolute want the nascent Christian civilization of Western Africa has of the *African Times,* or some other such public monitor and guardian, in the absence of which the most pernicious errors and evils would pursue their course with unbridled head. And here our heart almost fails us. While from every settlement on the Coast we have constant cries for our help, we do not find a corresponding effort to help us in our work. Every act of administration censured, every outburst of oppression and vice exposed, creates and strengthens bitter and active animosities against us; while the supposed friendships we make are, with some few honourable exceptions, rapid and fruitless. We have seriously reflected whether we should not withdraw from this work, which costs us not only time, labour, and anxiety, but money also. The last it need not absolutely cost us, if all our subscribers in Africa would pay as they all ought to do, and as some do. But as we dare not withdraw our hand from the plough while God gives us in any way strength to hold it, we have decided to wait and see what another year of labour and anxiety will bring forth. And having thus decided, we are justified in calling upon those who ought to be our vigorous and determined friends to do their duty also. To keep our paper within the reach of all who can read, we maintain the price of subscription at 5s. a-year. But we do not hesitate to say that no one on the West Coast of Africa whom God has blessed with sufficient means, or who could pay more by the exercise of a little wholesome self-denial, ought to think he has done his duty in thus paying 5s. a-year, for which he gets every month his newspaper sent free to him, while we are *giving* to him and his fellow-Africans what three or four hundred pounds a-year would not more than adequately repay. We are compelled to write very plainly; there is a large amount of unpaid subscriptions due from the Coast, which we absolutely require for paying outlay already incurred—and now there is the new year\'s subscription, July, 1867, to July, 1868, due also. In order that we may not have to give up this work for Africa, if we can by any possibility avoid so doing, we must insist that the new year\'s subscription be immediately paid to our agents by all subscribers, or sent direct to us; while, at the same time, we call upon all our readers to make a real exertion on our behalf. Where are the 750 petitioners from Sierra Leone? Are they earnest for the full liberties of British citizens? If so, those who have influence with them in the colony ought to show them the necessity of *doing* something to obtain and to secure those liberties. Every settlement on the Coast ought to do very much more than it has yet done; and for their own sakes we now urge upon all their people the necessity of doing their duty. We desire above all things to teach them earnestness and (under God) self-reliance. No people can rise without the exercise of these virtues, however much others may be disposed to do for them. When we urge that the advanced Christian civilization of Europe ought to do much for the nascent Christian civilization of Africa, we do not mean that the Africans are to sit with their arms folded and do nothing for themselves. The civilization brought to England in the early ages would never have spread had not the Anglo-Saxons done their part too. There must be African patriotism also, if Africa is to rise; and patriotism is not a thing of words, but of deeds. Every educated African should consider it his duty to work for Africa as well as for his own individual advancement and self-indulgence. When the foreign slave-traders came to the Coast to seek their cargoes of human victims, they found Africans but too ready to help in the accursed work. Now that this great iniquity has been put an end to, let there be shown an equal zeal in Africa, among those to whom enlightenment has come, to co-operate resolutely and heartily with all those agencies, missionary or other, that come to them for Africa\'s good; not forgetting that organ of public opinion—that public guardian which no influence can rob them of if they are faithful to themselves—the independent *African Times.*', 'last_edit_date': '1867-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1867#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE RIVER GAMBIA COLONY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When an editor sets honestly about the correction of abuses that may have become strong by time and impunity, his path must necessarily be a thorny one. A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

It also notes an intellectual revolution in West Africa, particularly in Sierra Leone, where a dynamic Creole culture emerged, contributing to missionary and intellectual activities, suggesting a parallel increase in Sierra Leonean engagement with African cultures and politics. However, it does not explicitly link Sierra Leonean curiosity to publications and narratives about African exploration. Similarly, The African Times articles discuss the publication and discussion of works like ""Wanderings in Western Africa"" and Dr. Schweinfurth's volumes, highlighting European nations' exploration and annexation activities, and the recognition of explorers by institutions like the Royal Geographical Society. These articles also note Sierra Leone's interest in resource development and the spread of civilization, indicating local curiosity and involvement in African affairs, though they do not specifically mention Sierra Leonean publications.

Next, the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars in Europe and the efforts, notably of Britain as the leading maritime power to contain the expan› sionism of France, spilled over to Africa. The French occupied Alexandria and Cairo in Egypt as the gateway to the Far East. The British seized the Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope. Thereafter, the increasingly triumphant British naval power found in the growing abolitionist move› ment a mission providing all necessary opportunities for intervention in Africa. In 1807 the British government prohibited the slave trade to British traders and converted the freed-slave settlement in Freetown into a Crown Colony and a base for a West Africa-wide naval campaign against the slave trade. The French were expelled from Egypt, but continued to seek commercial advantages and in other ways to profit from the weakness of the tottering Ottoman empire in North Africa, using the campaign against piracy in the Maghrib as an excuse. Following their defeat, the French were obliged to join the abolitionist movement and this too provided a reason for showing more interest in the coastal bases and trading stations in West Africa. Thus the abolitionist and missionary factors, and the search for alternative items of trade in place of the discredited trade in slaves were introduced into the politics of nineteenth-century Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.\nThis flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours.

This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.\nIn the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium.

Euro-African contacts, which until the beginning of our period had been confined largely to the coastal peripheries, were, in the period under review, steadily extended inland as a result of the Industrial Revolution, largely through the efforts first of explorers, then traders and, finally, missionaries. This steady extension of European contacts and influence inland included not only guns and powder, but also railways, telegraphs, agricultural and mining machinery, the print› ing press, technical education and, above all, finance capital. These new developments created opportunities, but also challenges and dangers. Among the most novel and interesting features of African history during the period were the initiatives and reactions of African rulers and advisers in the face of these opportunities and challenges. It would appear that in most cases the approach of the Africans was not simply one of blind imitation or wholesale substitution but rather one of adaptation and syn› thesis. Instances of this process of modernization in Africa are legion. 56 Egypt built its first printing press at Büläk, Cairo, in 1822; the first printing press was established in Portuguese Luanda in 1841; the first modern mines were opened in Algeria in 1845 and in the Gold Coast in the 1870s. Some of the states, such as Ethiopia and Tunisia, embarked on public works; nearly all the Barbary states, as well as Egypt reformed their monetary systems. Other states, such as Egypt, set up textile and cotton mills, saw mills, glassworks and paper mills, all during the reign of Muhammad 'AIL But more interesting and of far-reaching consequence was the moder› nization process in the military sphere. In the face of steady European encroachment, many African states, especially in North and West Africa, modernized the organization, training, equipment and recruitment of their armies.

There has been a tendency, similar to what happens in oral tradition, to telescope all significant change in the whole precolonial history of Africa into the favoured period of the nineteenth century. Fortunately, other volumes of the Unesco General History have already dealt with the dynamics of change in Africa in the earlier periods. The 'myth' of static Africa has thus already been exploded.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome.

The much-heralded black emigration schemes trumpeted by Garvey, whose ubiquitous publications reached deep into Africa, were only one example of a leitmotif which brought American blacks within the world view of African peoples. The themes of African redemption through American black missionaries were another.\nAfricans themselves, however, created the context of their next interaction with American blacks as they matriculated at American, largely Afro-American, schools and attended pan-African conferences and the like. Consequently, many Africans underwent a technical-educationalpolitical experience alien to their colonial world. When they re-entered their own worlds, many felt driven to resolve questions of ideology, cultural definition, educational values, political power, and pan-African unity or consciousness, guided by new perspectives.\nViewed against such an historical backdrop, the numerous pan-African conferences, Tuskegean educational and technical projects, the nØgritude movement and the occasional focus on American blacks in African millen› nial dreams, all illustrate the consistency of the pan-African theme among American and Caribbean blacks. They also show the variability of African responses to the New World overtures and ultimately the shaping by Africans themselves of these overtures to fit African specifications.\nIn sum, the populations of the African diaspora and the motive charac› terizing the many interactions between persons of the first and second black worlds included two visions. One was a vision of the union of religious forces among black populations in Africa and America or the reconstruction of Africa through importation of American and Antillean black technical expertise, initiated at the behest of American blacks. Another reflected the transformation of Africans from predicate to subject during the colonial period. The latter was a vision of the spiritual redemption, social recon› struction, and political reformation of African communities through the repatriation of African personnel and the energizing of African resources. Because of this vision, Africans had been educated in American schools, or sent to participate in technical and commercial activities; others were touched by American black writings or by anti-colonial ventures organized among blacks of the diaspora.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

The slave trade had intensified internecine warfare for over two centuries, leading to cultural devastation on an unprecedented scale.

The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.562, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in the face of partition and conquest', 'section_title': 'The ideology of resistance', 'content': ""Colonial apologists stressed the irrationality and desperation of armed resistance. They claimed that it was often the result of 'superstition' and that peoples otherwise content to accept colonial rule had been worked upon by 'witch-doctors'. Many European critics of colonialism, sympathetic to African protest, nevertheless also accepted that Africans had little in their 'traditional' patterns of thought which helped them to come to an effective or practical response to attacks on their way of life. The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ... Overnight, African political states lost their power, independence and meaning. 8"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.564, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'Among the social effects of foreign rule on African society, the most immediately noticeable was the political one. Pre-existing African states, except for Liberia and, up to 1935, Ethiopia, lost most of their sovereignty and with it the right to participate in the affairs of the world community except indirectly through their new masters. Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

But so long as demijohn follows demijohn of rum ... no reinforcements of missionaries and no homilies from professional philanthropists, on the blessing of European civilization will avail anything. 43 An ardent campaigner for Africa-oriented educational reforms, Grant, deeply influenced by Blyden, sought an educational system which had the university at its apex but only as an institution which was designed to provide research and teaching in fields related to Africa, as opposed to the 'conventional literary education which emphasized European culture and values'.

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

It is almost beyond belief how any individual out of the precincts of a lunatic asylum could take up his pen and deliberately scribble off for publication in a respectable journal—in THE most respectable journal in the world—as genuine facts, what he is perfectly conscious are merely counterfeit facts, manufactured on his own premises. The *Times* ought to resent this insult by exposing him. It is no excuse for this person that he received his information from his cook or his butler.

If this letter can be satisfactorily traced to the one suspected of being its author, then it will behove his Grace the Secretary of State for the Colonies to be very careful with regard to the official reports he receives from Cape Coast.\n\nThe truth respecting the ""Ocrah"" is this: An Ocrah is a domestic slave, generally a purchased slave, who, by good conduct, has acquired the confidence of his master or of her mistress. There are male Ocrahs, and there are also female Ocrahs, the latter more properly called Crabahs. They are to be found, not only in the palaces of kings, but in the household of anybody and everybody who is wealthy enough or foolish enough to purchase a slave for the purpose. The Ocrah may sometimes be the friend of his master, and the Crabah of her mistress, but is not by any means necessarily so. The probability is, that he does possess the confidence of his master, and she of her mistress, for neither would have been selected had they not evinced, whilst young, unusual capabilities for the performance of the ordinary domestic duties attached to their office. The number of Ocrahs and Crabahs in one household vary according to the wealth or the folly of the master or mistress. The King of Ashantee has in his establishment a staff of upwards of forty Ocrahs, the chief of whom is a fat eunuch, ""Ocrah Cherry"" by name.\n\nPerhaps ""An African"" will be good enough to inform us to which of them he refers when he talks of the Ocrah, the soul, counsellor, officer, adviser, friend, and companion of his ""old correspondent,"" Quaku Duah; or does he wish his audience to infer that these forty ""souls"" form a kind of privy council, without whose advice and consent the king dare not act?'}, {'id': 259, 'article_title': 'The Friend to the King of Dahomey', 'full_section_title': 'The Friend to the King of Dahomey', 'last_edit_date': '10-14-1863', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1863#article-25', 'issue_date': '23_11_1863', 'content': 'I cannot close this letter without mentioning at least one circumstance regarding the late King of Dahomey, which was related to me on two different occasions by two trustworthy individuals who had visited Dahomey half-a-dozen times, and were great allies with the King.

The King of Dahomey, on a certain occasion, expressed a curiosity to ascertain the exact appearance presented by an infant whilst in the womb, and in order to gratify that diabolical curiosity, this religious monarch ordered one of his female subjects who was in an advanced state of pregnancy to be brought before him. I cannot write what followed, as it would be too disgusting; but suffice it to say, that the King, having satisfied his curiosity, exclaimed, ""Is that all?"" There are those still living that can corroborate this.

I would respectfully caution the British public from attaching too much importance or faith to the tales of writers who, like ""An African,"" have had no personal experience of the men or things they enlarge upon, and whose knowledge thereof is derived from fifth-rate sources.

It is becoming too much the fashion to run down us poor Fantees; and if those gentlemen who are so prone to indulge their fancies would but turn to the history of their own country, they would perceive that it is nothing more nor less than “history repeating itself.” Somewhere about the year 447, when the Britons were being harassed by the Picts and Scots, they applied to Otius, then Prefect of Gaul, as near as my memory will serve me, in the following words: “The groans of the wretched Britons, to the thrice-appointed Consul Otius,—The barbarians” (and you were as barbarous in those days as we poor Fantees are now) “drive us into the sea, and the sea forces us back on the swords of the barbarians; so that we have nothing left us but the wretched choice of being either drowned or murdered.” Failing in obtaining the succour you were so much in need of, you had to go on your knees to the Saxons, give way before the Danes, and so on you continued till you finally succumbed to the domination of William the Conqueror and his sixty thousand followers. It was your numerous principalities, such as now exist here, without cohesion, without leadership, that caused you then to fall before “the barbarians;” and I have not the least doubt that you were looked upon by those barbarians as arrant cowards as you consider us; and it has taken you more than nine-teen hundred years since you were brought into contact with the Romans, who were then the acme of civilization, to reach your present summit. What may not fifteen hundred years hence find us; and where may you not be then? If we are such notorious cowards, if the meed of praise due us is to be withheld, why then, in the name of all that is good, why then, I ask, do you not go and fight your own battles (for this war is none of ours), without calling upon us to bear the brunt? In all ages and in all times, never have two nations engaged in a war without one or the other getting the worst of it; witness the Franco-German war, where the French, in no way the inferior of the Germans as regards courage, had to give way in almost every engagement before the superior skill, organization, and discipline of the German.

This is what makes it always difficult to get people in England to believe your assertions in the African Times; because the majority of all European classes on the Coast do all they can to contradict those assertions, and very often some African is employed to assist them in the contradiction.

It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

The possibility of such a thing had never yet reached my brain. At last, in colloquy with an old friend upon the Coast, the idea started up, and after due discussion, we adopted it. I speak of morals. In intellect the black race is palpably superior, and it is fast advancing in the path of civilization.""—Vol. II., p. 73. As the author\'s almost hatred of Africans is everywhere apparent, this, which would, no doubt, have been ""worn-out declamation"" from us, may possibly be considered worthy of credit.\n\nThe F.R.G.S. carries about with him everywhere ""a consul,"" as closely attached to and as inseparable from him as were the Siamese twins to and from each other, so that we may be excused if we fail at times to distinguish between them.

He read a little; but when excited, which was rare, he would declaim loudly against the practice of \'lecture,\' as worthless touching the main enjoyments of human life—eating, drinking, visiting friends, and attending the theatre. According to him, the summum bonum of human life was to lie upon his back smoking cigarettes and looking at the moon or at all the stars.

We expurgated the chief communication we had received, which was a long report of a criminal case brought before one of the Courts, and incidents in the trial. We did not name the Court, nor the presiding Judge, nor the parties concerned.

We had no resource but to bow to the decision, and refrain from publishing it. As it was strongly confirmative of what we had stated in our leader above alluded to, we can scarcely say that we submitted with a good grace.

At the same time, we feel it to be quite impossible to submit to entire silence, and, without therefore stating any of the particulars that were considered objectionable, we will merely give a short description of the *modus operandi* observed in obtaining a verdict. “When this\n\nwitness for the defence stated a fact that was important for the prosecution, the solicitor for the defence winked to the interpreter (the gentleman setting as Judge knowing nothing of the language), who did not interpret it at all. The solicitor then winked to the Judge, who thereupon said, \'Court adjourned for half an hour!\' The jurors then marched respectively in pairs to partake of refreshments, with sparkling moselle, &c., prepared for them by the said solicitor. On the reappearance of all parties in Court, after a few words of badinage by the solicitor, there were also a few from the Judge, concluding with, \'But I do not mean that you should find these parties guilty!\' and the jury obediently acquitted them."" It may be said, perhaps, the jury were right. But if we could publish the whole case, it would be seen in a moment that they were wrong, and that this was well known to those who induced the jury to return such a verdict. After our last month\'s leader we do not think it necessary to make any further observations on the above, merely adding that we could wish the report of the case as we have it were in the hands of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, to whom, however, it does not belong to us to forward it.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1882#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.612, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Complaints from Old Calabar', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The War on the Gold Coast, from the period of the crossing of the Prah by the invading Ashantees twenty months ago, and the Parliamentary and other public and official proceedings connected with it, and with the establishment of the new Gold Coast Colony, with coast extension over the old coast line purchased by Great Britain in time past from Denmark, have so occupied our columns, that we could not find time or space for a number of complaints of wrongs endured, and evil deeds committed in Native and British territories on the West Coast. If any of our readers have interpreted that comparative absence of complaints, as indicating that the West Coast was becoming an Arcadia, it is time that we dissipate the illusion by giving printed utterance to some of those denunciations and groans, perhaps too long suppressed by us. Of these, some will be found in the letters from Old Calabar inserted in our present number. These are not the first we have had touching the matters of which they complain; and perhaps it is scarcely necessary for us to say that we have greatly modified and softened them in publication. Half-educated West Africans who have wrongs and abuses to expose, seem to be under the impression that we have unlimited power to hold up individuals by name to public obloquy or condemnation, upon the mere statement of one, two, or three of their number—persons of whom we, perhaps, know little or nothing.

It is nothing but right in point of justice, that as the law punishes natives for soaking their palm kernels or adding other kinds of stuff to them in order to increase their weight, that the same law should provide a punishment for those who sell cloth thus deceptively made up, and which is nothing more than fraud of the very worst kind, as coming from people who call themselves civilised and Christianised, and who should know better.\n\n""I think the matter ought to engage the attention of the Government, and that an Ordinance should be passed inflicting a punishment on all merchants selling satteens in which a plank or board is found concealed, exactly as the natives are punished who adulterate produce.\n\n""Facts are very stubborn, and if by my frankness in exposing the vile practice I should give offence to the parties concerned, it should not be regarded as an offence but as demanding fair play.

A predominant trend would appear to have been the determined effort on the part of various African leaders to strengthen their power and their capacity to defend African territories and interests. These efforts were, however, systematically undermined and eventually subverted by the European presence.\nAs the chapters in this volume have shown, the nineteenth century in Africa was a period of rapid and sometimes contradictory changes. Up to the third quarter of the century, the most far-reaching and widespread of the changes had their origin in internal factors. Other changes were much affected or even initiated by European commercial, missionary or consular activities operating on the coast and, especially after 1850, increasingly penetrating into the interior. Some of the movements for change, such as the efforts of some rulers to unify Ethiopia and reform its institutions, were local in their impact. Others, like the activities of the ambitious khØdives of Egypt in the Nile valley had repercussions throughout a whole region. The Mfecane had begun as a local affair, but soon spread over the whole of Southern, Central and parts of East Africa and, even on the eve of the European conquest, the history of these areas was still largely the history of the states that had resulted from it or were very much affected by it. 1', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'Population growth', 'content': ""Demographers have published tables of African population change with apparent assurance,$^{1}$ but the truth is that our most certain knowledge of nineteenth-century human numbers is provided by a retrospective view from the vantage of the post-Second World War censuses.

In order to allow for the fact that Africa was demonstrably not uninhabited while permitting an estimate of a very large Asian population, there was little alternative but to allocate ioo million inhabitants to Africa. Willcox justified his use of these estimates by claiming that the population density of those parts of Africa not known to be growing fast in 1931 (that is excluding Egypt, Tunisia, northern Algeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, The Gambia, South Africa and Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia)) was the same as Riccioli's figure for the whole continent.$^{5}$ This procedure is, however, meaningless: Willcox retained the countries with the least known popula› tions at the time: there is no evidence that their populations were still stationary; there is no reason why their past densities should have been the same as the countries excluded. Willcox, arguing that there was no evidence of growth in Africa's population until recent times, retained the 100 million figure as his estimate of its population up to 1850."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': ""However, with the Akan states the problem was essentially one of sovereignty. There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Perspective', 'content': ""The tendency to explain change in Africa in the 'precolonial century' unduly, if not exclusively, in terms of the expanding scale of European activities constitutes the second issue in the historiography of the period. The increasing integration of African economies into the world system is often treated not merely as a major factor leading to change but in fact as the dominant theme of African history in the period. The nineteenth century is discussed not only as the prelude to the colonial period but essentially as its beginning. In accordance with the late Dr K. O. Dike's dictum of 'trade and politics' - that 'the history of modern West Africa is largely the history of five centuries of trade with European nations'$^{2}$ changes in the overseas trade and trade routes, and the internal network of markets and long-distance trading that fed the overseas trade have for too long been perceived as the major, if not the sole, dynamic factor in African history in the nineteenth century. Thus, the changes in Egypt are explained by the impact of Napoleon Bonaparte, rather than by the complex of internal factors dating back to the eighteenth century that produced a national movement that rallied round the Albanian Muhammad 'All's efforts to set Egyptian renaissance against Ottoman attempts to reimpose direct rule. Similarly, the Mfecane is explained vaguely as a reaction to the European presence, either in terms of pressure on the eastern frontier of the Cape Colony or a desire to profit from the Portuguese trade in Delagoa Bay, rather than in terms of the internal dynamics of northern Nguni society. The conjuncture of these remarkable events at the beginning of the century with the djihad movements in West Africa and new stirrings in Ethiopia is considered remarkable, and seems to require a global expla› nation.$^{3}$ But rather than seek for such explanation in the dynamics of African societies, the industrialization of Europe and the impact of the world economy on Africa has provided too facile an alternative hypoth› esis."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Sahara in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The reconstruction of Saharan history should take account of events at two levels, first the ebb and flow in the lives of Saharan nomads and inhabitants of oases - seasonal migration to and from pasture, the formation of new alliances and the break-up of others, the rise and fall of leaders, the story of raid and counter-raid, the epics of gallant warriors and noblewomen, and the life and times of merchants, holy men, and scholars.$^{1}$ Superimposed upon these local histories is the second level, with its larger patterns of historical change. In the nineteenth century the Sahara, remote though it was, came into increasingly close contact with the world economy. By the close of the century European economic penetration had affected the lives of many people, and the European conquest of the desert, though far from complete, had produced fundamental change in the nature of relationships between the Sahara and the outside world.\nThe paucity of data for history at either level presents both problems and challenges and points to the need for research in Ottoman, French, Italian, Egyptian, and Moroccan archives and in private collections. By the nineteenth century European interest in the desert increased because European powers viewed it as a commercial avenue to the Sudan, and European sources provide data that give some notion of historical processes. All written accounts, whether in European languages, Turkish, or Arabic, need to be filled out with oral histories, which have been collected only in a piecemeal fashion. For example, the Tuareg of the central Sahara have been well researched, but for other groups very little historical material exists.

There has been a tendency, similar to what happens in oral tradition, to telescope all significant change in the whole precolonial history of Africa into the favoured period of the nineteenth century. Fortunately, other volumes of the Unesco General History have already dealt with the dynamics of change in Africa in the earlier periods. The 'myth' of static Africa has thus already been exploded. Unfortunately, the corollary has persisted in the assumption that change in the nineteenth century was necessarily different from change in earlier periods and can i. P. Curtin, S. Feierman, L. Thompson and J. Vansina, 1978, p. 362. only be explained by reference to factors that did not previously exist. It is therefore important here to examine the extent to which the changes taking place in the nineteenth century were a continuation of changes already taking place in the eighteenth century, and to what extent they were due to new factors associated with the expanding scale of European activities and increasing integration of African economies into the world system."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Introduction', 'content': 'The djihäd movements of Islamic reformation covered the whole of the Sudanic zone of West Africa, and the eastern Sahara up to Cyrenaica, and spread south to the borders of the forest region as their impact reached Senegambia and the Voltaic regions, the southern Mandinka, northern Yoruba and the Edo-speaking peoples. As the European demand for palm oil, peanuts, ivory, sisal and rubber grew and the internal network of long› distance trade routes responded to these demands, trade became a major factor affecting access to firearms and the acquisition of wealth, and hence the rise and fall of states over wide areas of Africa. As a consequence of this expanding European trade and the activities of European and American missionaries, Christianity and European ideas of social and political organ› ization also became factors of change over a wide area stretching from Sierra Leone to Southern Africa and Madagascar.\nWhat stands out most prominently in these different movements is the efforts of various African leaders in the nineteenth century in different parts of the continent to reform their societies. Some of the efforts were inspired by the heritage of cultures in Africa, others by reformist ideas in Islam. In most cases, the leaders were only too ready to take advantage of opportunities offered by the expanding scope of trade and the activities of Europeans, whether traders or missionaries, hunters of game or hunters of concessions. Another feature that stands out just as prominently was how these efforts of African leaders to reform were systematically being undermined by the very activities of European traders, missionaries and hunters that African leaders tried to exploit.\nIt is remarkable how little attention so far has been paid to this feature of the nineteenth century: of internal efforts at reform systematically being aborted by external intervention. Because of the assumption that colonialism and integration into the world economy were necessary con› ditions of modernization, most historians have failed to notice how much the nineteenth century represented an African effort at self-development and to what extent European conquest and colonialism was a subversion of that effort.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Internal initiatives', 'content': ""Because we do not have the advantage of similar writings on the areas further south, the temptation has been greater to speculate on the possible or probable effects of Old Qyo's participation in the slave trade through the Egbado country and Porto Novo in the eighteenth century.$^{29}$ But such speculation, and other hypotheses on the possible effects of abolition have so far failed to explain the collapse of the empire structurally in its economic, political, religious and social bases, and the widespread experimentation with various political and religious ideas for new structures and systems in the nineteenth century. It is more likely that, as in the djikàd states, the seeds of collapse came from internal discontent and yearning for reform, and the actual collapse owed more to the penetration of Islamic ideas and the direct impact of the Sokoto djihad than to the slave trade and/or abolition. The consequent wars, population movements, colonization of new areas hitherto regarded as marginal such as the coastal swamps, the rise of new towns and markets, and the spirit of reform and experimentation, created new opportunities that the Europeans came to exploit rather than to set in motion.\nThis groping for renewal, then, will explain why so many African rulers in the course of the nineteenth century from Egypt and Tunisia to Madagascar and Lesotho, Abeokuta and Fanteland, suspicious as they were of European intentions, nevertheless risked cautious collaboration with European traders, adventurers or missionaries as a way of importing European technology to assist their work of development. It was not only Egypt that experienced a sense of renaissance. The nineteenth century may well be called the 'African Age of Improvement',$^{30}$ in which the urge for improvement dominated the scene, but the urge came from within.

In Bunafu, not only was there a sense of government and authority, some of the migrants came with traditions of structured hierarchical political systems from which they were fleeing, but which they still drew upon in the rivalries that accompanied the emergence of a new authority system in Bunafu. Others also carried with them belief in the power of a the mukama, a charismatic prince chosen and possessed by the god, or the efficacy of ritual firelighting from royal hearths, to affect fertility and harvests. As Vellut has argued, instead of the state-stateless dichotomy, we should think of two modes of power structures: the hierarchical, well-defined order based on the payment of tribute which was that of the kingdoms; and, at the other extreme, the more egalitarian and informal type of government by councils of elders and notables."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo* Basin and Angola', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The area with which we are concerned is broadly bounded by the Atlantic coast on the west, Lake Tanganyika and the Nile-Zaire ridge on the east, the Ubangui savannas on the north, and the plateau separating the Zaire and Zambezi basins to the south. The period we shall deal with cannot be limited to a single theme. Contrary to the common belief, the history of the years 1800-80 is not a matter only or mainly of long-distance trade and links with the outside world (the economy of Central African communities at this period was still based more on production than on trade). Nor can the precolonial nineteenth century be regarded as an era of widespread violence, because of the slave trade, civil strife, etc.: the commonplace belief that Africa was racked by incessant 'tribal warfare' overlooks the basic fact that the bulk of the peoples in the area led peaceful lives as producers, steadily improving their farming methods, bettering their environment and exporting the produce of food-gathering. Finally, the history of the nineteenth century is not to be reduced to purely political history concerned with despotic kingdoms and states: if there is a political feature common to the Central African communities of the period around 1800, it is more likely to be the much disputed quest for equilibrium and accommodation between powers derived from different sources.\nAn historical account of nineteenth-century Central Africa must in fact satisfy several requirements. It must describe the ordinary life and aspirations of the societies in this enormous area at the time. This would bring out the continuity between the 1800s and the more distant past: the changes, although noticeable, were slow.\nAt the same time, the history of Central Africa in the nineteenth century is characterized by breaks with the past. After all, in the years 1800-80 the area was more a part of the world trading network than ever before. The impact of the world economic situation, or of some specific sectors of it, was making itself felt: in some areas it influenced social and political history, giving a noticeable impetus to trade and offering new opportunities for stockpiling, while in others it restricted the process.

The nineteenth century saw the most revolutionary socio-economic change in Africa, namely, the abolition and suppression of the slave trade. By the end of the period under review and for reasons that are discussed elsewhere in this volume, the slave trade was a thing of the past. While abolition did not cause any sudden change in the rate of population growth, there is no doubt that the general tendency was one of gradual increase rather than, as hitherto, decline, especially during the last three decades of the period under review.\nBut growth was not the only change affecting population. What was even more dramatic was its redistribution, which took the form of internal migrations and movements. Typical examples of these dramatic internal migrations of the period were those of the Nguni in Southern and Central Africa, the Chokwe in Central Africa, the Azande in East Africa, the Fang in Equatorial Africa and the Yoruba in West Africa. The Nguni migrations, as will be seen later, resulted in the spread of the Nguni section of the Bantu peoples from the Natal region into different parts of South, Central and East Africa. Though the Nguni incursions caused a great deal of devastation, destruction and untold suffering, there were also some positive results. The Nguni conquered and absorbed new peoples to form new nations such as the Ndebele and the Sotho. By using the military and political systems and ideas developed by the Zulu, the Nguni also formed new kingdoms such as Gaza, Swazi, Ndebele, Sotho and Pedi. These kingdoms, were, in the words of J. D. Omer-Cooper, 'militarist, highly centralized and administered under the king by commoner indunas rather than royal relatives.'$^{1}$ Moreover, the presence of the Nguni inspired statebuilding activities among some of the peoples whom they invaded. For instance, the Holoholo living on the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika adopted the Nguni military tactics to build a strong kingdom. The Hehe of southern Tanganyika, who were divided into over thirty independent chiefdoms, also came together as a result of the Nguni incursions, and, using Nguni military regiments, weapons and field tactics, succeeded in conquering the neighbouring peoples such as the Sangu and the Bena and in forming a large Hehe kingdom."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Patterns of authority', 'content': 'The events of the early nineteenth century indicate a tendency towards centralized power structures, with the authority of the king becoming more effective than ever before.

The writer, who is no more an African than you are, Mr. Editor, affects to enlighten the British public in a most authoritative manner on certain matters relating to the Kings of Ashantee and Dahomey, and he also desires, apparently, to set himself up as the champion of ""Badahung."" Now, Mr. Editor, many good people in England may, possibly, be taken in by the effusion of this pseudo-African, who is anxious to have it believed that he is perfect master of his subject. But I hope to convince all right-judging men that he knows exactly nothing at all about it. Of course, no one out here, European or African, is likely to be bamboozled by such absurd second-hand balderdash from one who disguises himself in our much-despised skin in order to obtain currency for his spurious statements relative to the customs of our country. The writer of this romance appears, more than once in the course of it, to lose sight of the fact that he is, for the time being, disguised as an Ethiopian, and discloses his real character, while his ludicrous ignorance of his subject is apparent from first to last. We all here know well who he is. Those who are not utterly ignorant of the affairs of these parts, and who are, at the same time, capable of bringing intelligent minds to the calm examination of their subject—all declare that this pseudo-African is an individual who never visited either Coomassie or Abomey, and who never saw either his ""Old Correspondent,"" Quaku Duah, or his friend, Badahung. Yes, Sir, the writer is not one of our blood, but, as we believe, a Government official who quitted the Gold Coast not very long after the arrival of Governor Pine, in October, 1862, and who, so far from being ""An African,"" made no disguise of his inveterate antipathy to everything African. The imposition that is practised upon John Bull by his countrymen who have paid brief visits of from four to twenty-four months to Africa positively exceeds belief. Allow me, therefore, Sir, to call the attention of all real friends of Africa to this letter, and thus assist us real Africans to detect and expose those wolves who assume the sheep\'s skin in order to have the chance of more effectually devouring the sheep.\n\nA shameful practice is gaining ground of Englishmen, like the writer of the letter in question, assuming the disguise of Africans in order to give expression to opinions and assertions calculated to deter a benevolent Government and people, as the Government and people of England really and truly are, from persevering in their efforts to remove the only obstacles that at present oppose the progress and civilization of a great portion of our country—the countries of Badahung and Quaku Duah, of Ashantee and Dahomey.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-10-14', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1863#article-25', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE ASHANTI WAR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'No one believed throughout the protectorate, not even the gentleman who pretends to be omnipotent with the King of Ashanti, that his Majesty ever intended delivering up his German prisoners just now; and if the 1,000l. he asked for them had been sent up—and we believe that it would have been if this same gentleman could have had his way—his Majesty would have coolly pocketed the money, retained the white prisoners, and still have come to war.

The successor to the throne will, it is supposed, be Mensah, who was king up to a few months ago, but who was deposed on account of his barbarous cruelties.

If he refers to the chiefs or cabboceers that he occasionally came into official contact with at Cape Coast, he is right for once, as these chiefs have less power than one of the petty traders in their towns; but there is no room to doubt that he alludes to his ""old correspondent,"" Quaku Duah, and his friend Badahung, in which case he is guilty of a direct falsification of facts.

About the period that the Rev. William West, the superintendent of the Wesleyan Mission on the Gold Coast, was at Coomassie on a visit to the King, in company with the Rev. John Osco Ansah (an Ashantee prince) and Mr. Ghartey, a report was brought to his Majesty that a woman in a neighbouring village had made use of his great oath without sufficient cause. Quaku Duah at once despatched his executioner with his staff to the said village with orders (I need not say *strict or positive orders*, as in Coomassie all orders are positive and irrevocable) to slay every man, woman, child, sheep, goat, dog, fowl, and living creature therein, and to raze the place to the ground, and scatter salt over the ruins. *These orders were executed literally.* For the truth of this I refer to the three gentlemen named above.

It is almost beyond belief how any individual out of the precincts of a lunatic asylum could take up his pen and deliberately scribble off for publication in a respectable journal—in THE most respectable journal in the world—as genuine facts, what he is perfectly conscious are merely counterfeit facts, manufactured on his own premises. The *Times* ought to resent this insult by exposing him. It is no excuse for this person that he received his information from his cook or his butler. An individual who holds a high and responsible office under the Government of one of Her Majesty\'s foreign possessions, should be more than usually careful to ascertain that the assertions which he is about to put forth to the world in black and white, so that they cannot be recalled, are of that truthful nature that nothing could upset them. If this letter can be satisfactorily traced to the one suspected of being its author, then it will behove his Grace the Secretary of State for the Colonies to be very careful with regard to the official reports he receives from Cape Coast.\n\nThe truth respecting the ""Ocrah"" is this: An Ocrah is a domestic slave, generally a purchased slave, who, by good conduct, has acquired the confidence of his master or of her mistress. There are male Ocrahs, and there are also female Ocrahs, the latter more properly called Crabahs. They are to be found, not only in the palaces of kings, but in the household of anybody and everybody who is wealthy enough or foolish enough to purchase a slave for the purpose. The Ocrah may sometimes be the friend of his master, and the Crabah of her mistress, but is not by any means necessarily so. The probability is, that he does possess the confidence of his master, and she of her mistress, for neither would have been selected had they not evinced, whilst young, unusual capabilities for the performance of the ordinary domestic duties attached to their office. The number of Ocrahs and Crabahs in one household vary according to the wealth or the folly of the master or mistress. The King of Ashantee has in his establishment a staff of upwards of forty Ocrahs, the chief of whom is a fat eunuch, ""Ocrah Cherry"" by name.\n\nPerhaps ""An African"" will be good enough to inform us to which of them he refers when he talks of the Ocrah, the soul, counsellor, officer, adviser, friend, and companion of his ""old correspondent,"" Quaku Duah; or does he wish his audience to infer that these forty ""souls"" form a kind of privy council, without whose advice and consent the king dare not act?', 'last_edit_date': '1863-10-14', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1863#article-25', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ACCRA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Since I wrote you last, we have had ""rumours"" of war and earthquake.

I have received a letter from a missionary in Kyebi, Akim, who says: ""The Ashantee war rumours are most confused. First, we were told that three armies were marching towards the protected territories (one towards Cape Coast; the second to attack Agyemang, chief of a part of Akim, who was fighting with the other Akim chief, Ata, in 1859-60, and retired westward to Soedru; and the third towards the river Volta). Soon afterwards a messenger from Kumassie arrived at Kyebi in due form (i.e., with a gilt sword, as a sign that he is sent by the King of Ashantee), who said that \'the Ashantees will not fight with Ata—they are not Ata\'s enemies.\' But the Akim do not believe him, and keep a strict watch at the frontiers, as it might be a ruse. The messenger further stated: \'Agyemang (the chief of Soedru, who was in former times under Ashantee rule, but withdrew to Akim, and is therefore not a good friend of Ashantee, but attached to the English Government) has killed an Ashantee man, and has stigmatised others by cutting marks in their faces, as the Donkos have them (which are slaves in our country), and has sent them back to Ashantee. He intended to hint to the King of Ashantee that he considers him not better than a despised Donko. This made Kwako Duah, King of Ashantee, angry, who has sent his warriors to catch Agyemang. But this wicked man has run away to Fantee. Therefore Kwako Duah has sent a messenger to Ata, to tell him that he has nothing to fear.\' This is the message.

No one knew of the king's death but the principal Ocrah in the palace, and as the principal chiefs went to pay their accustomed respects to their sovereign they were all seized, the door locked, and everyone was slaughtered there and then to accompany the king to the other world. Of course this was a grand signal for the commencement of the decapitation, and for weeks on an average there were forty human beings killed per day.\n\nThe Princes of Ashantee went about shooting, stabbing, and otherwise butchering any one they met in the streets or in houses.

Two instances of great devotion were displayed by two of the late king's wives; they followed the procession to the grave, and as their lord the king was placed in his sepulchre, they drank bowls of poison and threw themselves alongside of him. The rest of his wives were decapitated by force. The prince informs me that the stench in Kumasi was dreadful, and he was glad to get away from the horrors that surrounded him.

If this is not absolute power, perhaps ""An African"" will tell us what is. How an individual who is not in the slightest degree acquainted with the King of Dahomey can reasonably venture to dispute so authoritatively what is alleged respecting that monarch by M.

One was a celebrated slavetrader, now dead; the other an equally well-known native merchant. The King of Dahomey, on a certain occasion, expressed a curiosity to ascertain the exact appearance presented by an infant whilst in the womb, and in order to gratify that diabolical curiosity, this religious monarch ordered one of his female subjects who was in an advanced state of pregnancy to be brought before him. I cannot write what followed, as it would be too disgusting; but suffice it to say, that the King, having satisfied his curiosity, exclaimed, ""Is that all?"" There are those still living that can corroborate this. Now, I should say that one whose religion would not deter him from committing a crime which I believe to be unparalleled would not hesitate to order the slaughter of any number of his helpless dependents. Everybody knows that he often does so, and every honest man who knows it will also candidly admit it.\n\nI have now a very few words more to add. I would respectfully caution the British public from attaching too much importance or faith to the tales of writers who, like ""An African,"" have had no personal experience of the men or things they enlarge upon, and whose knowledge thereof is derived from fifth-rate sources. Government officials who come out to the Gold Coast for a couple of years or less, who seldom move outside the Castle at Cape Coast, and who glean their information on all they intend to write about from their boys or from ignorant people of the lowest class (who just ""look in"" to get a glass of the white newsmonger\'s gin), cannot be expected to furnish the public with literary food of a healthy quality.

Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ...

The slave trade had intensified internecine warfare for over two centuries, leading to cultural devastation on an unprecedented scale. Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent.

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.604, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'Military conquest, 1885-1902 > The map of Africa after partition and occupation', 'content': ""The new geopolitical map of Africa that evolved after about a generation of systematic boundary-making and military occupation was quite different from what it had been in 1879 (see Fig. 1.1).

On balance, then, although the map of Africa in 1914 (see Fig. 2.1), compared to what it was in 1879, may have looked very confusing, the delimitation had nevertheless been a remarkably efficient job, thanks to the new advances in cartography. And although the partition must be condemned as illegal and immoral, and it must be recognized that some of the boundaries were indeed artificial and arbitrary, it would be undesirable - indeed dangerous - to continue to advocate a return to the fluid, pre-European international boundaries except after a very close scrutiny - because of the 'mess' said to have been created by the partition."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.591, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > National prestige', 'content': ""The greatest exponent of this theory is Carlton Hayes.

European leaders, in short, having consolidated their nations and realigned their diplomatic forces at home, were propelled by a nebulous or atavistic force which expressed itself in a 'psychological reaction, an ardent desire to maintain or recover national prestige'.

European statesmen averted this crisis in power politics and drew back. Power politics from that point on to the Bosnian crisis of 1908 were removed from Europe and played out in Africa and Asia. When conflicting interests in Africa threatened to destroy European peace, the European powers had no choice but to carve up Africa in order to preserve the European diplomatic balance that had stabilized itself by the 1880s."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.585, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 259, 'article_title': 'The Friend to the King of Dahomey', 'full_section_title': 'The Friend to the King of Dahomey', 'last_edit_date': '10-14-1863', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1863#article-25', 'issue_date': '23_11_1863', 'content': 'There is not a single individual out of Ashantee more capable of imparting sound and *genuine* information on all that relates to the King and people of that country than this gentleman, who can attest that Quaku Duah holds the lives and the property of every individual in his kingdom at his sole command. Also that Quaku Duah has frequently ordered his subjects to be executed simply to remind them that the power of the knife is in his hands alone, or in order to acquire their property; that the King is everything, and the people nothing but so much live stock to be slain when fat enough—i.e., rich enough.

Another cause which has left the Malagasy all behind in the race is the power of the press against them. Mauritius and Bourbon count ten newspapers which feed the French papers—i.e., about ten millions of readers hear nothing but bad reports about the Hovas. Even the *Merchants\' and Planters\' Gazette* of Mauritius, in its number for May 20, 1884, believes that it is telling the truth when it represents the English and Americans as ""gaining concessions of land which are relentlessly refused to France."" People seem to confound altogether a ""concession"" and a ""lease,"" but the French people do not; and however much Governments pretend not to be influenced by the public press, it is very certain that all these false reports are only provoking jealousy and fanning the flame of war. When the Malagasy Ambassadors went to Europe, even their presence and influence could not withstand the current of false opinions about the Hova people. Then followed the Malagasy official *Gazette*, which now keeps us informed of the truth, but which is hated like a viper because it does publish the truth. The false structure built up by unprincipled agitators is beginning to totter. The idea of impoverishing the Hovas is absurd. Imerina is rich in cattle, its agricultural resources are unbounded; iron, copper, and lead are plentiful for making arms. Cotton is plentiful for weaving. Imerina could supply the London market with eggs and poultry without any appreciable diminution, and as long as the French leave a single creek open, they might just as well...\n\nas well give up blockading altogether, as far as the Hovas are concerned. Wherever the French settle, even if they succeeded in settling anywhere, the natives would desert them, and they would have to import even rice, or plant it themselves. For every agriculturist who settles, they will require two soldiers to guard him, and a doctor to attend him in the fever. The natives will always prefer to work for the English and Americans, who are friendly with the Hovas, for the same wages, and no fear of punishment, than to work for the French under penalty of having their heads cut off. The Hovas have the most powerful weapon against the French as long as they hold Imerina; they have simply to call in foreign capital to start iron works, lead works, sheep-farming on the healthy hills of the interior, and leave the fever-stricken French Creoles with a gun in one hand and a spade in the other to linger out a jeopardised existence.

It is absolutely untrue that the posts of the Association have been attacked by Arabs. What is true is that Arab bands have committed depredations in a few villages of the Upper Congo, beyond the limits of the protectorate of the stations; but, far from displaying hostile dispositions towards the Association, their chief, Tippu Tib, paid a visit to one of the agents of the Association, M. Van Gele, and upon the latter's energetic representations with reference to the conduct of the Arabs, Tippu Tib endeavoured to excuse it by pleading that his subordinates had exceeded his instructions, which included a positive prohibition of warlike operations, and that his lieutenants had only had recourse to that extremity in consequence of the refusal of the natives to supply them with provisions. To prevent the continuance of such disorders, Tippu told the agent of the Association that he was going to send orders to his lieutenants to withdraw, and this in fact he did.""}, {'id': 5575, 'article_title': 'The Safety of Mr. H.

Since the explorer was alive and well on June 19, his death, to have taken place at all, must have occurred since that date. But, even supposing Mr. Stanley to have been killed on June 20, the news of his death could not have arrived at the coast by the time the rumour reached San Thomé, seeing that even a special despatch by the Congo route has occupied two months in transmission. It is true that a second rumour was telegraphed subsequently from the French Consul at Zanzibar to Paris, to the effect that Mr. Stanley, abandoned by Tippoo-Tib, had been murdered, with most of his men. But there are grounds for regarding this report merely as an echo of the first. In all probability, it has only just penetrated to Zanzibar, and the French Consul there sent it to his Government as a piece of news. Even were it an independent rumour, its correctness could be disproved upon physical grounds. The transmission of the news of Mr. Stanley's death to Zanzibar in less than two months is quite impossible, even allowing for the rapidity with which news is passed from mouth to mouth in savage regions. At Brussels the rumour is utterly discredited, though the Berlin journals have gone so far as to publish obituary notices of Mr. Stanley. Happily, these funereal tributes are premature.

Taking a bird's-eye view of the whole situation in time and space, so that each factor might assume its proper relative position and proportion, he unhesitatingly affirmed in the plainest language that so far their intercourse with African races, instead of being a blessing, had been little better than an unmitigated curse to them.

The article attributes to our client conduct so inhuman and abominable that he is most anxious that the public should be freely informed what the facts really were. We have, therefore, to request that you will give this letter as great prominence in your paper as the editorial article in your issue to which we have referred. In the month of June last, the Biafra put into Grand Cess, to land some Kroo passengers, and, as usual, canoes came off from the shore to land the passengers and their effects. Kroo passengers learned from those coming from ashore that there was some dispute between the town from which the canoes had come and the town to which they wished to go, and where they resided. Not knowing how far this dispute had gone, or whether actual fighting had taken place, the Kroo passengers were afraid to land, and asked Captain Rattray to wait until canoes should arrive from their own town. The ship had already been delayed, waiting for canoes, and was behind time; so that it was uncertain when canoes would, if at all, come from their town. Captain Rattray informed them it was impossible for him to wait, but he offered to take them to Bassa or Monrovia.\n\nto land them there, and give them a note to the Captain of the next returning steamer to take them back. This arrangement was entirely satisfactory to the passengers, and they were landed by the steamer's boats at Monrovia, where the Captain gave them the promised note for their passages home by the Company's next steamer, giving them, in addition, a week's rations of bread and meat. From this you will see that Captain Rattray, instead of treating the men in the cruel manner attributed to him, treated them in the best possible way, and, for their accommodation, went much farther than there was any legal call upon him. We may add, that we have in our possession a duly signed and attested certificate to the effect that there is no truth whatever in the article you have quoted.

The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown. ""Freetown, with its hills rising behind it, forms a pretty picture from the bay where ships lie at anchor, but the town itself is fairer to behold from a distance than pleasant to inspect closely.

They made such a plausible tale that I was quite taken with them, and forwarded a box of gold dust, together with samples of goods I wanted in return. This came duly into their hands, and I received an acknowledgment from them with a statement showing that the gold dust had realised £56 10s. 10d., but that the goods I required would cost a good deal more than that. I accordingly obtained and forwarded to them a draft, making in all £97 10s. 2d.; at the same time sending them my gold watch (value £7) for cleaning and repairs in London. This second remittance was also acknowledged in due course—and there the matter ended! Finding weeks go by, and nothing come to hand, I wrote to a firm in London, upon whose integrity I can rely, for them to inquire into the matter, and do the best they could—either in the way of getting back my money or by urging these people to hurry on with the goods, so that I might not entirely lose the market. They accordingly wrote to the firm in question several times, but only to receive vague promises of immediate attention, or still more evasive answers. So I determined myself to come to London to see what could be done. And the upshot of my inquiries is that the firm to whom I had consigned my money and goods have proved utter swindlers: they traded under a fancy name, and when they found things were getting too hot for them they left the country, so as to be beyond the reach of the law.\n\nFor myself I must make up my mind to cut my loss; as I understand that even if I could get hold of the swindlers there is no chance of my regaining any portion of what they have had from me.

This context suggests a potential for biased media sources and questionable authenticity in reports, though it does not explicitly highlight unreliable communication networks or misinformation as significant problems. In contrast, The African Times articles explicitly support the claim by detailing instances of skepticism and misinformation. They caution against trusting French reports about Madagascar without English confirmation, indicating unreliable communication networks and biased media sources. Doubts about the authenticity of reports from European explorers, such as M. Jules Gerard's claims about Dahomey, and the premature obituary notices of H. M. Stanley further illustrate these issues. The articles also discuss false reports about diamond discoveries and the challenges journalists faced in verifying information, as seen in the libel case involving Captain Rattray.

The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible.

Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.562, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Black American evangelism in Africa', 'content': ""At the Congress, Bishop Turner renewed his advocacy of black emi› gration to Liberia.

The spread of the radio later made the repressive measures which colonial rulers adopted to screen away their colonies from external influences more difficult and less effective.\nAs has been emphasized, constitutionalism, and the use of newspapers and radio as media of expression, were dependent on the availability of legislative institutions in the colonies or the hope of having them, as well as the existence of a significant number of western-educated Africans who could make appropriate use of such institutions and organs of expression. Also, the approach of the western-educated African nationalists pre› supposed the acceptance of Western European models of political develop› ment such as nationalists without their experience could not appreciate. Uneven spread of education was, therefore, an important variable in the expression of African nationalism and anti-colonial politics. As European powers concentrated on making colonies pay for their administration and services, relatively little was done to spread western education and provide infrastructure for political and social development. In several areas of colonized Africa between the two world wars, primary schools were still few and far between and secondary education was a rarity. In British Central Africa, French Equatorial Africa, Soudan and Portuguese Angola, Mozambique and Guinea, there was practically no access to secondary education before the Second World War.

As J. L. Vellut has emphasized, the nineteenth century was not just 'the history of the ebb and flow of the world economy as experienced by ... Africa', but also 'the slow-moving ... history of diversification in making use of natural resources.'$^{20}$ It is essential to emphasize this internal factor on which the external came to impinge and which shaped the response of African peoples to the external factors. As Cohen has shown in his chapter on the Great Lakes region hitherto studied only as a collection of centralized states responding to external forces - 'the nineteenth century was not simply a world of states, large and small. It was also a world in which individuals and households were in innumerable small, sometimes undramatic ways, altering their orientations to state authority, to service, to production, and to the market.' 21 The agricultural system around the ancient city of Kano in northern Nigeria at the beginning of the nineteenth century provides interesting similarities and contrasts with the world of Bunafu in the 'unadministered zone' of northern Busoga. For one thing, the market played a stronger role in the economy, since Kano was a well-established centre of local, regional and international trade based in part on major and highly successful industrial activity in the manufacture, dyeing and distribution of textiles, and the tanning of leather. Yet it would be misleading to concentrate on the channel effects of the markets and trade routes and to ignore the network of social and cultural relations on which the markets and the trade routes depended. Similarly, in Kano, there was the influence of Islam, and the much greater role of the ruler and the ruling class and merchants of the walled city in the management of the economy. And yet in Kano, as in Bunafu and the village communities of Tunisia, the bulk of agricultural production not only of basic essentials but also of a variety of cottons and dyes was in the hands of commoners in the rural areas among whom the household was the unit of production. As Abdulahi Mahadi has observed in a recent study, the head of a household in the Kano area, the maigida, was 'like a ruler of a town'.

The caravan under Mr. Stanley left Yambuya on the 28th June 1887, to accomplish this journey, and since then no news had been received, except certain rumours, the first of which was dated November of last year. Some deserters were heard of by the late Major Barttelot as having arrived at an Arab camp about thirteen days\' march from Yambuya. These men stated that the expedition had entered into a forest region, with mountains and marshy valleys, sparsely peopled by a hostile population, and that one of the white men had been wounded by an arrow. They also said the expedition had taken nearly three months to traverse the distance which had occupied a month in returning, and from this he (Sir Francis) was inclined to believe that Mr. Stanley had accomplished about 250 or 300 miles of his journey when the deserters left him. The next rumour was that of a white Pasha appearing in the Bahr-el-Gazel. This came via Khartoum and Suakim. He supposed that Mr. Stanley, finding the forest and mountainous region difficult to traverse, had turned to the north, and arrived in the neighbourhood of Tangayi.

When I arrived at Bomma, to disentangle the idle tales fabricated there about Livingstone approaching the West Coast, the same parties who were interested in them showed me on several occasions, and rather mysteriously, some stones, said to be diamonds; and indicated the neighbourhood of Sooka, or Mossuko, as the place they had been found at. I told them at once that whatever the different samples in particulars would turn out to be, they might be satisfied that there were no diamonds amongst them; that the most of them were garnets or other silicates. As the geologist of the German expedition had not yet arrived on the Coast, I proposed to them to take some specimens with me to Berlin, to have them accurately examined there, as every collection from an unknown country, like that of the Upper Congo, would be of scientific interest. But as often as the question about diamonds was broached again, my answer was invariably the same, that I could recognize nothing to warrant such a supposition. Since my return, the specimens have been examined by highest authority in Berlin, and they have been proved to be, besides garnets (as mentioned before), crystals of magnetic iron metamorphosed into hematite. That the mountain ranges of Central Africa will show themselves rich in unknown treasures, scientific as well as commercial, is probable enough; but till now, there do not exist any indications in which direction to look for them; and I feel, it therefore, my duty to protest against deluding the public by vague surmises, and inveigling fortune-seekers into a country where their purse will be lightened when or even before they get there, and their health destroyed if they stay there, without a fixed purpose. When, on my homeward voyage, the steamer touched at the Gaboon, I was told there that, a few weeks ago, a Portuguese (with a name unknown to me) had been passing through there, and had spoken of diamonds having been discovered at Bomma, and as having been examined by me. I declared this at once to be a perversion of truth in its direct contrary, and I asked the trading gentlemen on the Coast to contradict the false reports whenever they heard them repeated; and as I now see that they have found their way into your columns, I beg permission to contradict them there likewise.—Your obedient servant,', 'last_edit_date': '1874-02-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/28_03_1874#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.616, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Local Press Mis-statements', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—I consider it due to the public to draw attention to the incorrect statements that appear in the three first issues of the _West African Herald_, under the present editor.\n\nIn his first issue (I shall take one instance only out of the numbers that appear in each paper) it is stated that the Fantis, although numbering 70,000 against 12,000 Ashantis, had been defeated by the enemy.

We expurgated the chief communication we had received, which was a long report of a criminal case brought before one of the Courts, and incidents in the trial. We did not name the Court, nor the presiding Judge, nor the parties concerned. But it was held by our publishers that there was sufficient to lead to identification; and that, therefore, as “the greater the truth the greater the libel,” they could not take the risk of allowing it to appear in our columns. We had no resource but to bow to the decision, and refrain from publishing it. As it was strongly confirmative of what we had stated in our leader above alluded to, we can scarcely say that we submitted with a good grace. And yet, considering the small amount of support received by us from the West Coast, where comparatively so few of our nominal subscribers think it necessary to pay for the African Times, we can have no doubt they were right in preventing us as well as themselves from incurring any risk of the expense of defending an action for libel.

The solicitor then winked to the Judge, who thereupon said, \'Court adjourned for half an hour!\' The jurors then marched respectively in pairs to partake of refreshments, with sparkling moselle, &c., prepared for them by the said solicitor. On the reappearance of all parties in Court, after a few words of badinage by the solicitor, there were also a few from the Judge, concluding with, \'But I do not mean that you should find these parties guilty!\' and the jury obediently acquitted them."" It may be said, perhaps, the jury were right. But if we could publish the whole case, it would be seen in a moment that they were wrong, and that this was well known to those who induced the jury to return such a verdict.

The article attributes to our client conduct so inhuman and abominable that he is most anxious that the public should be freely informed what the facts really were. We have, therefore, to request that you will give this letter as great prominence in your paper as the editorial article in your issue to which we have referred. In the month of June last, the Biafra put into Grand Cess, to land some Kroo passengers, and, as usual, canoes came off from the shore to land the passengers and their effects. Kroo passengers learned from those coming from ashore that there was some dispute between the town from which the canoes had come and the town to which they wished to go, and where they resided. Not knowing how far this dispute had gone, or whether actual fighting had taken place, the Kroo passengers were afraid to land, and asked Captain Rattray to wait until canoes should arrive from their own town. The ship had already been delayed, waiting for canoes, and was behind time; so that it was uncertain when canoes would, if at all, come from their town. Captain Rattray informed them it was impossible for him to wait, but he offered to take them to Bassa or Monrovia.\n\nto land them there, and give them a note to the Captain of the next returning steamer to take them back. This arrangement was entirely satisfactory to the passengers, and they were landed by the steamer's boats at Monrovia, where the Captain gave them the promised note for their passages home by the Company's next steamer, giving them, in addition, a week's rations of bread and meat. From this you will see that Captain Rattray, instead of treating the men in the cruel manner attributed to him, treated them in the best possible way, and, for their accommodation, went much farther than there was any legal call upon him. We may add, that we have in our possession a duly signed and attested certificate to the effect that there is no truth whatever in the article you have quoted. We would only add, that the Biafra never was at Settra Kroo at all on the voyage referred to.—\n\nWe are, Sir, your obedient servants,  \n**Hill, Dickinson, & Co.**\n\nIn inserting the above letter of Captain Rattray, we beg to express our deep and sincere regret that we should have been misled into copying from the Monrovia Observer, and publishing in our columns, with editorial remarks on the same, the false and calumnious statement of which Captain Rattray so justly complains.

We should not have copied the statement into our paper, but that it stated, ""the men were landed at Monrovia, many of them entirely naked."" Now, Monrovia is not a very large place, and as it had long seemed to us that the Monrovia Observer was most respectably and carefully conducted, we naturally supposed that the Editor had satisfied himself of the truth of the very serious allegations. In this it appears that we were altogether in error, and were thus innocently led into inflicting pain upon the Captain of the steamer. Those who know us personally would understand how deeply this would grieve us. Instead, however, of availing himself of the offer contained in our leader, Captain Rattray placed the matter in the hands of his Attorney in Liverpool, and we received a letter from them, threatening us with proceedings for libel, and our Printer also, unless we published in our next number a refutation of the charge, with our apologies for its insertion and for our comments. We replied immediately, that nothing could have given us greater pleasure than the assurance that the alleged circumstance never occurred, and that we were ready to publish any letter of Captain Rattray to this effect, supplementing it with expression of our most sincere and heartfelt regret that we should have given publicity to so false a statement. We received a reply that this was unsatisfactory, and that unless we agreed fully to their demands to publish whatever they might send to us in contradiction, with the most ample apology, and agreed to pay all costs, proceedings would be commenced immediately. We were not in London on the Saturday to receive this, and our Printer wrote them to this effect, but when we found it on the Monday we reiterated by post our willingness to do all that could be reasonably required to atone for our unintentional offence.

But on receiving the writ, we placed the matter in the hands of our Solicitors, Messrs. Hollams, Son, and Coward, to effect a settlement, when what appears in another column was agreed upon and accepted as satisfactory, on our payment of costs. In making this statement of facts to show our African readers the perils to which we are exposed in our labours for Africa, we again repeat our deep and sincere regret for any pain we may have caused Captain Rattray by the reproduction of the falsehood in our columns, while, at the same time, stating that we should have done this without any legal proceedings on his part, which have thus inflicted on us a heavy and unnecessary expense. We cannot, however, acquit the Editor of the Monrovia Observer of blame in this matter, and we think he owes us an apology as full and sincere as that which we have given to Captain Rattray, and which, we repeat, we should have given upon a simple statement and demand had such been made direct to us by him.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.625, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'REVIEW.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Books are like men.

They made such a plausible tale that I was quite taken with them, and forwarded a box of gold dust, together with samples of goods I wanted in return. This came duly into their hands, and I received an acknowledgment from them with a statement showing that the gold dust had realised £56 10s. 10d., but that the goods I required would cost a good deal more than that. I accordingly obtained and forwarded to them a draft, making in all £97 10s. 2d.; at the same time sending them my gold watch (value £7) for cleaning and repairs in London. This second remittance was also acknowledged in due course—and there the matter ended! Finding weeks go by, and nothing come to hand, I wrote to a firm in London, upon whose integrity I can rely, for them to inquire into the matter, and do the best they could—either in the way of getting back my money or by urging these people to hurry on with the goods, so that I might not entirely lose the market. They accordingly wrote to the firm in question several times, but only to receive vague promises of immediate attention, or still more evasive answers. So I determined myself to come to London to see what could be done. And the upshot of my inquiries is that the firm to whom I had consigned my money and goods have proved utter swindlers: they traded under a fancy name, and when they found things were getting too hot for them they left the country, so as to be beyond the reach of the law.\n\nFor myself I must make up my mind to cut my loss; as I understand that even if I could get hold of the swindlers there is no chance of my regaining any portion of what they have had from me. But I hope my experience will be of some use to others who, trading on the West Coast of Africa, are under the necessity of trusting so much to persons or firms in London or the other European capitals.—Yours faithfully,', 'last_edit_date': '1891-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1891#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TRIBUTE TO THE ""AFRICAN TIMES.""', 'section_title': '', 'content': '[We cannot refrain from making the following brief extracts from the letter of a valued correspondent.

'They rejected the only correct explanation which regards rebellions as just wars for liberation, which is why they were supported by the overwhelming majority of Africans.' l In 1965 Davidson emphasized that 'many rebellions are not yet known... Often we do not have concrete information about those rebellions that are considered an established fact'. Since then, the job of 'discovering' resistances has gone on apace. Historians have begun to classify revolts more rigorously, distinguishing 'social banditry' from 'peasant rebellion', and guerrilla warfare from the clash of armies. In some cases episodes trumpeted by the colonialists as rebellions have been shown to have been forced upon the people by ignorance and fear on the part of the whites. 2 In many more cases considerable and significant resistances have been rescued from obscurity.

To the members of this school such as H. H. Johnston, Sir Alan Burns and, more recently, Margery Perham, Lewis H. Gann and Peter Duignan,$^{10}$ Africans in fact welcomed the establishment of colonial rule since not only did it save them from anarchy and internecine warfare but it also brought them some concrete benefits. Thus Margery Perham: most of the tribes quickly accepted European rule as part of an irresist› ible order, one which brought many benefits, above all peace, and exciting novelties, railways and roads, lamps, bicycles, ploughs, new foods and crops, and all that could be acquired and experienced in town and city. For the ruling classes, traditional or created, it brought a new strength and security of status and new forms of wealth and power. For many years after annexation, though there was much bewilderment, revolts were very few, and there does not appear to have been much sense of indignity at being ruled. ' ' Such ideas are also reflected in the use of such Eurocentric terms as 'pacification', Pax Britannica and Pax Gallica used to describe what amounted to the conquest and occupation of Africa between 1890 and 1914. Those historians who did pay some attention to this subject mentioned it almost accidentally or casually. In their A Short History of Africa which first appeared in 1962, one of the very first modern professional surveys of the history of Africa, the English historians, Roland Oliver and J. D. Fage, devoted only a single paragraph to what they termed 'bitter resistance' by Africans in a chapter of fourteen pages dealing with what has become known as the European Scramble for African colonies.

The 'regularity' and 'generality' of resistance emerges yet more clearly when we add to our catalogue of armed opposition and revolt during the Scramble the earlier indirect resistances to European economic aggression. Exploration of the ideological basis of resistance gains a new richness when we add the first manifestations of 'consciousness' on the part of workers or peasants to the idea of sovereignty and to the search for a new moral order. And the exploration of the links between resistance and the present situation of Africa gains a new resonance from the idea of economic resist› ance. The last word may rest not with a historian but with a political scientist, Colin Leys, who has called for a more dynamic and historically founded theory of 'underdevelopment': in one critical respect underdevelopment theory tends to resemble 'development theory' - it concentrates on what happens to the under› developed countries at the hands of imperialism and colonialism rather than on the total historical process involved, including the various forms of struggle against imperialism and colonialism which grow out of the conditions of underdevelopment ... what is needed is not a theory of underdevelopment but a theory of underdevelopment and its liquidation ... a theory of this kind implies nothing less than a theory of world history from the standpoint of the underdeveloped countries, a theory of the oppression and liberation of these countries; something ... in a fairly rudimentary stage of development, however keenly the need for it may be felt. 47 The study of the resistances is not a romantic dwelling upon the futile glories of the past but can make its own contribution to a theory of oppression and liberation."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Much has been written about the African response to foreign penetration and eventual rule towards the end of the last century and the beginning of the present. Most of the discussion, if not all of it, has been centred on the dichotomy between resisters, who by implication are to be praised as heroes, and so-called collaborators, who also by implication are to be condemned as traitors. This classification came about as a result of the nationalist struggle for independence in Africa, as elsewhere in the world. Those involved in the movement tended to see themselves as heirs to a long tradition of struggle whose roots go back to the beginning of this century, if not earlier. It was assumed that independence was a good thing and to strive for it was natural. Consequently, all those who had resisted European penetration of Africa, in order to preserve its inde› pendence, were heroes to be emulated and given an honourable place in the histories of the countries that had gained their independence through resistance to colonial rule. Put in these terms, this view is an attempt to use the standards of the present, with the aid of hindsight, to interpret the events of the past. In the colonial situation, those who resisted were described by colonial officials as short-sighted while those who collaborated were seen as far-sighted. Today, nationalist historians in East Africa con› demn so-called collaborators, especially chiefs, and praise resisters. 1\nAmong the resisters, there were also divisions. There were those who took to armed confrontation with the intruders - active resistance. Then there were those who, though they did not take to arms, refused to co› operate with the intruders.

He sees the partition and con› quest as the logical consequence of European nibbling at Africa which started well before the nineteenth century; he accepts that the essentially economic impulse that necessitated that nibbling changed drastically during the last quarter of the nineteenth century; that the change was caused by the transition from slave to legitimate trade and the subsequent decline in both the export and import trade during that period, and that it was this economic change in Africa and the consequent African resistance to increasing European influence that precipitated the actual military con› quest.

If they were less farsighted, less fortunate or less well-advised, they would see their traditional enemies siding with the invader and would themselves assume an attitude of resistance, which could all too easily end in military defeat, the deposition of chiefs, the loss of land to the native allies of the occupying power, possibly even to the political fragmen› tation of the society or state ... As with the slave trade in earlier times, there were gainers as well as losers, and both were to be found within the confines of every colonial territory. ls Ronald E.

We have read it attentively, but we cannot find in it that dependable rectification of errors in King Weah’s statement, published by us last month, which we had looked for. Having received constant and minute intelligence from Cape Palmas, from the period of the advent of the Liberian Commissioner there, we discover that there are important omissions in the Report; nor are we at all satisfied that King Weah’s statements are incorrect as regards either of the two great points—viz., the commencement of warlike operations and the territorial claims. We are surprised at the failure of the Report on these points, because, if there be one thing more than another in which the public men in Liberia have excelled, it has been in the drawing up of their Reports, Presidential Messages, and other State documents; and still more surprised, because many portions of the Report are written with a most charming air of sincerity and good feeling, becoming the character and position of the Commissioner. The Commissioner states that there was a warlike demonstration of the natives on the 10th of August, and that on the following day some of them began deliberately to fire on the Hoffman Mission Station. He then adds: “Thus war began, as far as I know the facts.” As the Commissioner was at Cape Palmas at that time, he must have had a personal knowledge of the facts had they been such as he relates; and the impression produced on our mind is that, not himself believing the statement to be altogether true, he was too conscientious to vouch for it. Then as regards the Land question. The Special Commissioner states that the object of the combination among the natives is “the re-possession of the territory,” which involves rights and powers that would be incompatible with the fiscal arrangements of the Liberian Government; that the natives “deny that the Liberian Government has acquired the domain; that they declare themselves the masters; that they ignore the deed of purchase by the Maryland Colonization Society, and assert that the articles therein mentioned were paid to them for landing the immigrants and building their huts.” Looking to probabilities, we cannot believe that the natives sold the entire lands of their country, and their own right of free action, but only the lands on which they permitted the immigrants of the Colonization Society to settle, assisting them in landing, building their huts, &c.

You have levied taxes, imposed duties, and governed us in every sense as you do your Crown colonies and other dependencies. You make and unmake kings and chiefs; you treat with Ashanti without consulting the kings and chiefs over whom you have assumed such a protectorate; you have divested them of all power and authority over their subjects, and over even their own domestics; you fine and imprison them as you think fit; you legislate for them, make laws, pass ordinances, bills, &c., without consulting them; and by your fiat, can make them vassals to a foreign power, without their being taken into your deliberations. All this, and more, you do; and when, through your thirst for extension of territory and lust for empire—when, through the blundering of your officials, and their crass ignorance and mismanagement, you find yourself launched into a war, you begin execrating us poor fellows, who had no hand in bringing this war about, and talk of giving over a portion of our territory to appease his Majesty of Ashanti, just as though the Gold Coast were British territory, and not merely British protectorate territory, and could be given out in plots, ""regardless of what might be thought of it by the Fantees, who seem to be of no use to us or to themselves.""\n\nThe writer of these words shows throughout his article a pitiable ignorance of the question he is discussing.

Liberia, in its wide sense, means the Monrovians and the colonists of Cape Palmas; but, to give you a full understanding, you will note that the present war with the Monrovians and colonists of Cape Palmas entirely excludes the aborigines of the Monrovia territory; for Monrovia was first settled before Maryland County (Palmas). The former was settled in 1821, and the latter in 1834, and both became one in the war between the colonists and the aborigines of Cape Palmas in 1856-7. Whether the Americo-Liberians have bought the countries of the Kroos under the Monrovians, we cannot tell or have anything to do with; but we are after our native land, which they in pretence say they have bought from us.\n\nThe Liberians never bought our land, and neither do they conquer us by war. In the war of 1856-7 we conquered them in the battle of Shepherd Lake, when their cannons, drums, and other best fire-arms were taken from them, but were freely restored by us when they sent a white flag to our king, which ended the war.\n\nAgain seeing themselves improved from the advantage of the country, and with a boasting and proud heart, by reason of new ammunition procured from the United States Government (whether by purchase or present, I do not know), they foolishly declared this present war.

Taking a bird's-eye view of the whole situation in time and space, so that each factor might assume its proper relative position and proportion, he unhesitatingly affirmed in the plainest language that so far their intercourse with African races, instead of being a blessing, had been little better than an unmitigated curse to them.

In this strait, Mahabah sallied from the town with his followers, gave battle to the Badiboos, defeated them, took their King prisoner, beheaded him, pursued the fugitives through the kingdoms of Barra and Salem, and even called upon the King of Keyang, on the other side of the river, to destroy those who had fled thither for protection.\n\nThis is at least a clear and intelligible statement, such as we were quite unable to extract from preceding accounts.

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs. It shows nice powers of observation—great diligence—a clear appreciation of facts, and a mental daring that does not shrink from the great problems of the future of the various divisions of his race, on which the light of Christian civilisation is only now beginning to shine, and who are for the most part placed under circumstances most unfavourable to its increase. After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries. Showing us their actual condition, and exposing many errors of administration which are opposed to material development and social advancement, he views the whole in connexion with the resolutions of the late House of Commons Committee, 1865, recommending the preparing of the several people for self-government. He shows the great changes that must be induced and fostered to make such self-government possible, safe, or beneficial. Though he has evidently a deep and, we believe, a just faith in his race, he does not shut his eyes to any of the disadvantages of their actual position and the difficulties in the way of their progress toward Christianity, civilisation, and wealth.

To those who moved from the assump› tion of racial inferiority of the black to the assumption that he would ultimately disappear from the face of the earth in the face of white power, Horton argued: we find that wherever the African race has been carried to ... they increase, no matter under what depressing and burdensome yoke they may suffer; from which it may be safely inferred that the African people is a permanent and enduring people, and the fancies of those who had determined their destruction will go in the same limbo as the now almost defunct American slavery. 40 Finally, in answer to the proposition that the black was incapable of improvement, he argued: 'Africans are not incapable of improvement, but that by the assistance of good and able men they are destined to figure in the course of time, and to take a prominent part in the history of the civilized world'.$^{41}$ Again in his Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast, Horton wrote in the Preface: Horton not only condemned racism but was also one of the earliest advocates of pan-Africanism.

The newspapers became a particularly vital organ for the dissemination of the views for these political and social organizations: The slowly expanding intelligentsia provided the audience and market which sustained an increasing number of newspapers and periodicals in the period. Apart from those published within Africa, a fair number also came from outside the continent serving as vehicles for transmission of the anti-colonial and anti-imperialist propaganda of inter› national movements. The appearance of these papers varied from daily, weekly, fortnightly to monthly. Others were published only when it was possible. A number of the newspapers and periodicals had been in existence before the First World War. Such were al-Liwa, an Arabic newspaper founded in 1900 to popularize Egyptian nationalist ideas, La DØmocratie du SØnØgal, and The Lagos Weekly Record founded in 1891.

Indeed, in writing his West African Countries and Peoples, his aims were not only to 'disprove many of the fallacious doctrines and statements of anthropologists (detrimental to the interests of the African race)', but also to establish 'the requirements necessary for establishing that self-government recommended by the Com› mittee of the House of Commons, 1865'. 44 Even more prolific, more radical and perhaps better known was Horton's contemporary, Edward Wilmot Blyden.$^{45}$ Though born in St Thomas in the West Indies, he migrated at an early age to Liberia where he studied, lived and worked as a lecturer and diplomat till his death at the age of 80. He published numerous books and pamphlets and delivered many speeches in Europe and America, all in condemnation of the racist theories of the day. Among those published during the period under review were African Colonization (1862), Vindication of the Negro Race (1857), A Voice from Bleeding Africa on Behalf of Her Exiled Children (1856), Hope for Africa (1861), From West Africa to Palestine (1873), and Christianity, Islam and the Negro Race (1887). In these works he also advocated 'Africa for the Africans', pan-Africanism, the African personality, Islam and polygamy which were to him more in keeping with African personality, insisted on the purity and integrity of the black race and therefore condemned mixed marriages, championed Ethiopianism and, above all, preached racial pride. In an article published in 1874, he praised the Mande and Fulbe peoples, who were Muslims and were developing the idea of a national and social order without the aid or hindrance of foreigners. Blyden concluded: During all the years which have elapsed since the commencement of modern progress, the African race has filled a very humble and subordinate part in the work of human civilization.

The fact was that for the non-Muslim areas of Africa probably the most important single innovation of foreign rule was literacy. Even for the Islamized areas, the coming of literacy in the Roman script gave a new impetus to Muslim education. Literacy was for many African peoples a new magic, and was sought after as such and at all costs since it appeared to open the treasure house of the modern world. To know the amount of power, authority and influence which the first generation of African clerks, interpreters and teachers exercised is to have some idea of the spell which literacy cast over many African peoples.

The reputation and resources of Tuskegee, however, were brought to Africa by African and American alumni and, often, by numerous African visitors to Tuskegee or correspondents with Washington who had never been matriculated students. Consequently, through the media of numerous international conferences, visitations, and technical missions, many Africans were touched by the 'Tuskegee Spirit' or drew upon Tuskegee's and other American black resources."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Conclusions', 'content': 'In broad pan-Africanist terms, however, the evidence seems clear that African political and ideological visions were expanded and technical expertise was improved because of colonial African interactions with American blacks. The much-heralded black emigration schemes trumpeted by Garvey, whose ubiquitous publications reached deep into Africa, were only one example of a leitmotif which brought American blacks within the world view of African peoples. The themes of African redemption through American black missionaries were another.\nAfricans themselves, however, created the context of their next interaction with American blacks as they matriculated at American, largely Afro-American, schools and attended pan-African conferences and the like. Consequently, many Africans underwent a technical-educationalpolitical experience alien to their colonial world. When they re-entered their own worlds, many felt driven to resolve questions of ideology, cultural definition, educational values, political power, and pan-African unity or consciousness, guided by new perspectives.\nViewed against such an historical backdrop, the numerous pan-African conferences, Tuskegean educational and technical projects, the nØgritude movement and the occasional focus on American blacks in African millen› nial dreams, all illustrate the consistency of the pan-African theme among American and Caribbean blacks. They also show the variability of African responses to the New World overtures and ultimately the shaping by Africans themselves of these overtures to fit African specifications.\nIn sum, the populations of the African diaspora and the motive charac› terizing the many interactions between persons of the first and second black worlds included two visions. One was a vision of the union of religious forces among black populations in Africa and America or the reconstruction of Africa through importation of American and Antillean black technical expertise, initiated at the behest of American blacks. Another reflected the transformation of Africans from predicate to subject during the colonial period. The latter was a vision of the spiritual redemption, social recon› struction, and political reformation of African communities through the repatriation of African personnel and the energizing of African resources. Because of this vision, Africans had been educated in American schools, or sent to participate in technical and commercial activities; others were touched by American black writings or by anti-colonial ventures organized among blacks of the diaspora. This latter vision seemed not so much to discard as simply to vindicate and to reorientate to an African perspective the idealism implied in the earlier vision.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Foreign intervention in Liberia and Ethiopia, 1915-35 > Liberia', 'content': ""Howard University; Nnamdi Azikiwe, a Nigerian journalist; the Lott Carey Baptist Foreign Mission Society, the A.M.E.

An old Persian aphorism says, ""You may feed a snake upon violets, and lull him to sleep upon roseleaves, but he will produce nothing but poison."" So it is with some human beings. In what we did for them and theirs in vindication of great principles, we did not look for attachment or reward. If it had come to us, we should have accepted it and been grateful for it; but we were never disappointed in its not coming. If we had the power to give them personal benefits, beyond what they are receiving from our official enemies of whom they make themselves subservient tools, they would become at once loud-tongued and strong-penned adherents. But as this cannot be, they follow their natural instincts. The time may come when they may be victims of some flagrant abuse of power, some disgraceful injustice, some odious wrong.

We know nothing but this, and the welfare of Africa, and honour of England as connected with it; and wherever and whenever one of those great principles which it has been our duty and glory to defend and vindicate, is or may be in our opinion violated in the person or property of any man on the West Coast, however vile or unworthy he may be, we shall as heretofore do battle in his behalf, as though he were our dearest friend and the most admirable of the human race.\n\n---'}, {'id': 2638, 'article_title': 'CHRISTMAS AND THE NEW YEAR', 'full_section_title': 'CHRISTMAS AND THE NEW YEAR', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/31_12_1873#article-13', 'issue_date': '31_12_1873', 'content': ""Arrived now on a narrow border land between two years, it is natural that before entering upon 1874 Memory should take its retrospect of 1873—a year which, whatever may be the issue of the Ashanti War, must mark the commencement of important changes in Western Africa. With regard to our public work in this Journal, we ask ourselves if we have done our duty. This is particularly needful, because we have had to carry on this work amid constant personal trials and difficulties, shattered hopes and painful retrospects. We need not further allude to this, beyond the mere statement that the evil came upon us from an African source, whence it could not have come had not deception been allied with ingratitude. Neither perhaps was willful. When a man belies his Christian profession, and falls into a course of open sinful rebellion against his God, he cannot be expected to be watchful not to fail in his duty to his fellow-man. We could not expect that he would be true to us, who was false to his Redeemer and his God. We, therefore, feel only grief, not anger, as regards the human instrument through whom God has seen fit to permit that we should endure trial. But to our work. Have we slighted or neglected it? We cannot find, and we hope our friends have not found, that we have done so. We have always endeavoured to lose ourselves in the work before us—the work which we believe God had appointed us to do; and on examination, we do not hesitate to say that, had our warnings and entreaties been regarded, Her Majesty's Government would not have been compelled, as we think they now are, to occupy Kumasi. We may possibly enumerate these warnings and entreaties in another article. The past does not weigh on our conscience, and we gird up our editorial loins, that in this respect we may be free in the future as in the past. The year 1874 will open with a great direction of public attention in Europe, and especially in Great Britain and Ireland, towards Africa. We feel persuaded that the Ashanti War, whatever may be its progress and results, will not remain in the annals of 1874 as a solitary and unallied episode. Other events of magnitude, as regards the introduction and spread of Christian civilization, and the development of natural and industrial resources in West Africa, will spring out of and otherwise accompany it. The germs of the future are in the past and present; and we cannot believe that the preparation of centuries, since the prows of Portuguese and French adventurers first clave the waters on the West African Coast, from Senegal to Loanda, has been only for the comparatively miserable results that have hitherto appeared in West African countries. We are, therefore, looking every year more and more confidently, to a great immediate future; and there is much in the circumstances under which 1874 will be opening in African countries, to indicate that in this year we shall witness the visible beginnings of those important changes we have been expecting. We should have rejoiced had we been able to enlarge our paper at this time, so that we might more fully chronicle the progress and achievement of the Ashanti expedition under Sir Garnet Wolseley and Captain Glover. Were it only a question of time and labour, we should not shrink from it, but it is a question of money also, and we cannot now afford it. We can only hope that educated Africans will awake some day to the knowledge of how important the **African Times** has been, and is, as regards the advancement of their true interests in every way; and they will then give it, should it then still exist, a far more efficient measure of support than it has ever received from them hitherto. Meanwhile we wish them all a happy Christmas, and all good things for the year 1874.""}]","[{'document_title': 'OUR FIFTH VOLUME', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In changing the form of our Journal, and adopting that in which it now appears, we have deferred to the oft-expressed wishes of many of our earliest and most constant friends. The African Times now occupies an acknowledged position as the registrar and exponent of native wants and progress, and the advocate of native interests, more especially on the West Coast. Our aim in the future will ever be, as it has been in the past, to make it practically useful; and we again solicit the support of all who have at heart the real welfare of native Africa and its people, both for this Journal and for the Society by which it was founded, and to whose efforts with Government and individuals so much of its power for good may be attributed. And more especially do we commend the African Times and the African-Aid Society to the warm and earnest support of the educated Africans of the West Coast. The African Times brings them, as well as their rulers, face to face with British public opinion, by which they have much to gain in the work to which we hope they all feel themselves pledged—viz., that of the Christian civilization of the whole African people, and the industrial development of those great natural resources with which Africa has been so liberally endowed.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-07-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_07_1865#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.768, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Our Twelfth Year', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We have usually made a few special remarks with the beginning of each new year of *African Times'* existence. We see no reason why we should not continue to do so. God has this year blessed our efforts by making them visibly instrumental to great good. When we think of the arbitrary errors of a Salmon and a Glover—of what might have been the fate of the Fanti Confederation and its oppressed officials—what might have been the fate of the bulk of those connected with the trade and commerce of Lagos but for our persistent interference in their behalf,—we do indeed rejoice at having continued this work for the good of Africa and her people. We enter, therefore, on this our twelfth year, rich in hope, and not poor in joy. Not that our subscribers pay better than they did. Never have we received so little from them as during the past year; for, to the shame of but too many of them be it said, paying is the very last thing they would seem to think of. There are good and even noble exceptions; but these are, alas! very few. To them we tender our congratulation that they comprehend and appreciate our labours for African advancement, and their own duties and obligations. We want all their aid in every way. Every educated and God-loving African has weighty duties resting upon him. He has been brought out from the mass of heathen superstition and abasement, not through any effort of his own, but under the good providence of God, by the noble and disinterested efforts of others; and this, not only for his own present and eternal good, but that he may be an instrument of good to others, who yet remain entangled by the filth and ignorance of those fiendish idolatries, which have made Africa an object of so much compassionate grief to Christian people. And Christian enlightenment ought also to bring with it a love of country; stimulating to noble and patriotic efforts to do everything possible to free it from all that is evil and degrading. Our efforts in demanding better government for the West African Settlements, and the removal of abuses there, are directed only against such things; and no Christian African ought to allow himself to be seduced by paltry pecuniary or other yet more empty considerations, into becoming an abettor, defender, and supporter of them. God helping and strengthening us, we shall not relax in our efforts; and we hope, year by year, to have to welcome new and ardent fellow-workers among the Africans themselves, and to rejoice in new successes."", 'last_edit_date': '1872-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1872#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.728, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'OUR THIRD VOLUME.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Non ego, sed gratia Dei.""*\n\nIn commencing our Third Volume, we hope we shall be considered justified in saying that our promises have been fulfilled. It is on this ground that we call for continued and increased support. We have let in more light upon African affairs than was ever before thrown on them. But our allotted task is only begun. If we have checked some evils, prepared the way for the removal of others, and effected some real good, we regard these results as merely the first stones in our structure of African improvement. We receive from so many quarters in Africa the gratifying assurances that this journal is exercising great power for good, that we now claim from the friends of Africa, as a right, that support which we first solicited, in hope that we might possibly advance by our labours the great cause of the industrial regeneration of Africa. It is not too much to say that we have prepared the way for those commercial companies which are now coming full of promise into the great field of undeveloped African commerce. We have given Africa a voice among influential people in Great Britain. We have made her cries for help, that she can and will so richly repay, heard by those who have the power and the knowledge that are needed for successful efforts in her great fields of produce. But when we compare her gigantic evils with the elements of good directed against them, we feel that the work of her regeneration is one that demands the devotion of our life, and in which that life, by God\'s blessing, shall be spent. We can do nothing, however, without proper support. It is only by its being subscribed for, and read, that this journal can prove effective. And even so the African Times must necessarily have comparatively but little weight and influence without the effective organization of the African-Aid Society at its back; constantly available for action with Government and individuals for removing obstacles from the path of African progress; for denouncing with a voice of authority abuses which have but too long prevailed; apathy and inertia that reflect disgrace upon Great Britain as a civilized Christian power in presence of African barbarism and destructive superstition; and for pointing out the way to a better future.\n\nout measures that must be adopted, if Africa is to be raised from her degradation, and the slave-trade and slavery destroyed upon her coasts and within her borders.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1863#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.729, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Editorial', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'COMMENCING with the present number, the size of the African Times is permanently increased to sixteen pages.

During that period the whole of the anxiety, labour, and responsibility, both public and pecuniary, which it has involved, have been borne by one individual, the Editor. When first started, he undertook, subject to the condition of a certain number of copies being subscribed for individually by some members of the Council of the African-Aid Society, that it should never involve that society in any pecuniary loss or responsibility. Contrary to his opinion as to the conditions under which a public journal could be successfully conducted, and submitted to by him solely with the object of facilitating its establishment, a committee of a few members of the council of that society was appointed to meet monthly, prior to its publication, for considering the articles, &c., which the Editor had decided to insert. But to this the Editor attached a stipulation that he would not consent to any alterations of which he did not himself fully approve, and which he did not consider advisable or innocuous. Such a committee of course could not work, and the Editor freed himself almost immediately from the nominal restriction, which only served to increase the difficulty of bringing out the paper on the proper day, without effecting any useful purpose whatever. A perfect and entire independence of thought and opinion in the editor is essential to the success of any and every public journal. During five years, therefore, the whole labour and responsibility have, as before stated, rested with one individual, the present Editor. Such an anniversary as this is therefore a solemn one with us. The objects the Editor has endeavoured ever to keep in view have been the promotion of good government in the British African colonies and settlements, to force a removal of official abuses, to promote material development and increased facilities of transit and trade, as auxiliaries to missionary effort, and as indispensable, not to the reception of Christianity, but to the existence and spread of Christian civilization in Africa. Having entered upon this work with a deep sense of responsibility to God, we feel bound to ask ourselves how that work has been performed. With the measure and extent of its success we have nothing to do, that we leave in the hands of Him who worketh through individual agencies on the earth, according to His own infinite wisdom. But have we done our duty by the African people, and have they, on their side, done their duty towards us? As regards the former, we can only look to our motives and our desires. We have endeavoured to keep a watchful guard over ourselves as ""one who must give an account before God,"" and we have, with no small sacrifice of time and rest, conscientiously striven to give to Africa in our labours whatever talent or wisdom God may have bestowed upon us for that purpose. As regards the latter, we think we have cause of rejoicing rather than of complaint. The number of our African subscribers has continuously increased, filling up, in a way most satisfactory to us, the gaps in our subscription list caused by the withdrawals of those of our early friends who considered, we suppose, that no further effort on their part was necessary to our support. And we have given a voice—a public voice to Africa. Few people in England, unfortunately, care much about her or her concerns. The English Anti-Slavery party, fully occupied in their high and noble object of the eradication of negro slavery everywhere, have not yet had time generally to recognise the importance of paving the way, and preparing for, and aiding in the work of Christian civilization in Africa itself.

In 1856 he completed his second journey across Central Africa from Angola to the Zambezi delta. Prior to this period, the Church Missionary Society had sent three German missionaries to start work in East Africa. Johann Krapf arrived in Mombasa in 1844 and was followed by J. Rebmann in 1846 and by J.J. Erhardt in 1849. Their mission station was established at Rabai near Mombasa. By 1856 Rebmann had crossed the Nyika plain to Kilimanjaro to become the first European to see the mountain, and Krapf had gone farther south to visit the Shambaa kingdom of Kimweri and then north› wards to the Kamba country where he was the first European to be shown Mount Kenya. Erhardt and Krapf also travelled farther south to the mouth of the Ruvuma and later, after spending some time in Tanga, Erhardt was able to publish a map of East Africa containing a mass of information he had gathered on the coast about the interior, including the Great Lakes, which he represented as an inland sea. Erhardt's 'map was to be the main inspiration of Burton and Speke in their expedition of 1858'. 51 This first group of missionaries acted as pioneers; they gathered con› siderable information that was extremely valuable to those who followed them. Yet their information hardly came to the attention of the general public and it was only when Livingstone began his attacks on the Arab slave trade in speeches and writings that the popular imagination was caught. In the spirit of the capitalist free-trade conviction of his time, Livingstone was emphasizing the power of commerce, which, he believed, would integrate the vast interior with Christian Europe, thus relieving Africans of the poverty and humiliation caused by the slave trade. He therefore concentrated on travelling in search of navigable rivers, or what he called the 'open path for commerce and Christianity'.$^{52}$ The publication of his Missionary Travels$^{53}$ in 1857, together with his personal appeals, inspired the formation of the Universities Mission to Central Africa (UMCA) by a group of English High Churchmen.

Between 1858 and 1873 the CMS, UMCA and the Holy Ghost Fathers were all involved. The CMS continued to work at Rabai near Mombasa, where freed slaves from Bombay were sent to assist Rebmann. The UMCA was located in Zanzibar while the Holy Ghost Fathers worked in Bagamoyo. None of these societies had succeeded in carrying out Livingstone's mission of opening the interior for commerce and Christianity. Nevertheless, the work had begun. For, while the missions were beginning to take root on the coast, the interior of East Africa was being explored by Europeans who had been inspired by the initial efforts of these missionaries. In 1858 Burton and Speke had set out to find Erhardt's 'Sea of Unyamwezi'.$^{54}$ They reached Lake Tanganyika and Speke also visited the southern shores of Lake Victoria. In 1862 Speke returned with Grant to explore Lake Victoria, and also located the outflow of the Nile. While following the White Nile they met Samuel Baker, who had come up the river from the sea. Later Livingstone himself was to return once more to the heart of Africa, adding more to what had already been revealed. The explorations had a tremendous effect on the missionary invasion. The existence of the big lakes immediately seemed to prove the validity of Livingstone's plan. All major British missionary societies that were working in East Africa wanted to place steamers on these inland waterways. The most important stimulus derived from these explorations sprang from their revelations about the extent and character of the Arab slave trade. For it became clear that the interior was not as inaccessible as Krapf had thought of Kenya or as the UMCA missionaries had thought of the Lower Shire. Certainly caravan routes penetrated the whole interior and human cargo was getting to the coast through them. Even more significant was the revelation of what this trade implied for the lives of the Africans. . <- After Livingstone's death greater zeal was roused among British mission› ary societies. The impact of his public funeral ceremony in Westminster Abbey touched almost every pulpit and stimulated popular support for missionary work.

He had been ill with chronic dysentery for several months past. Although well supplied with stores and medicine, he seems to have had a presentiment that the attack would prove fatal. He rode a donkey, but was subsequently carried, and thus arrived at Muilala, beyond Lake Bemba, in Bisa country, where he said, ""Build me a hut to die in."" The hut was built by his followers, who first made him a bed. He suffered greatly, groaning night and day. On the third day he said, ""I am very cold; put more grass over the hut."" His followers did not speak or go near him. Kitumbo, Chief of Bisa, sent flour and beans, and behaved well to the party. On the fourth day Livingstone became insensible, and died about midnight. Majuhara, his servant, was present. His last entry in diary was on April 27. He spoke much and sadly of home and family. When first seized he told his followers he intended to exchange everything for ivory, to give to them, and to push on to Ujiji and Zanzibar, and try to reach England. On the day of his death the followers consulted what to do. The Nassick boys determined to preserve the remains. They were afraid to inform the chief of Livingstone\'s death. The secretary removed the body to another hut, around which he built a high fence to insure privacy. They opened the body and removed the internals, which were placed in a tin box and burned inside the fence under a large tree. Jacob Wainwright cut an inscription on the tree as follows: ""Dr. Livingstone died on May 4, 1873,"" and superscribed the name of the head man, Susa. The body was preserved in salt, and dried in the sun for twelve days. Kitumbo was then informed of the death, and beat drums and fired guns as a token of respect, and allowed the followers to remove the body, which was placed in a coffin formed of bark, then journeyed to Unyanyembe about six months, sending an advance party with information addressed to Livingstone\'s son, which met Cameron. The latter sent back a bale of cloth and powder. The body arrived at Unyanyembe ten days after advance party, and rested there a fortnight. Cameron, Murphy, and Dillon together there. Latter very ill, blind, and mind affected. Committed suicide at Kssakera: buried there. Here Livingstone\'s remains were put in another bark case, smaller, done up as a bale to deceive natives who objected to the passage of the corpse, which was thus carried to Zanzibar. Livingstone\'s clothing, papers, and instruments accompany the body. When ill Livingstone prayed much. At Muilala he said, ""I am going home."" Chumah remains at Zanzibar. Webb, American consul at Zanzibar, is on his way home, and has letters handed to him by Murphy from Livingstone for Stanley, which he will deliver personally only. Geographical news follows. After Stanley\'s departure the Doctor left Unyanyembe, rounded the south end of Lake Tanganyika, and travelled south of Lake Bemba, or Bangweolo, crossed it south to north, then along east side, returning north through marshes to Muilala.

The Rev. J. F. Schön was born at Baden, in Germany, and received his education at Basle, and subsequently at the Islington C.M.S. College. He was made deacon in 1831, and was promoted to the order of the priesthood in 1832, in which year he commenced his mission work in Sierra Leone. He accompanied Captain Trotter in his Niger Expedition in 1841 with a view of exploring new regions for the Gospel; he contracted the germs of a fever on that occasion which eventually compelled him to leave Africa in 1847, from which date he has resided in England. Dr. Schön has since been actively employed in compiling books, and making translations in the languages of West Africa, a knowledge of which he acquired on the spot. He has spurned the name and the position of a ""disabled"" missionary, for all his powers have been unceasingly devoted to the service of the Lord, and he could with difficulty be kept back by the order of his doctor, at the age of eighty-five, from his daily work with eye and pen. The great language of the Hausa, spoken by tens of millions, and destined to be a most important element in the civilisation of the negro, has been revealed to the world by Dr. Schön, in dictionaries, grammars, reading-books, and translation of the Bible. Not content with publishing a book, he has, immediately after publication, commenced a studious revision and enlargement, and has lived to carry through revised editions. When he was stationed in Sierra Leone, he studied and published works in the Mende language; and, when on the Niger, he mastered the Ibo language; and by keeping himself in con...\n\nstant touch with negro scholars in the field, he has kept his knowledge up. Large portions of the Bible and the Prayer Book in Ibo will survive as proofs of his industry and power. Some may think lightly of such labours. Yet one day he met Livingstone at dinner at Lambeth Palace, and the great traveller made the following remark to Archbishop Sumner: ""This man\'s name will live generations after mine has been forgotten."" In a special assembly at the University of Oxford the degree of D.D. was conferred upon Dr. Benson, the Primate, ""causâ honoris,"" on account of his high station, and on Dr. Schön, ""honoris causâ,"" as a small acknowledgment of all his labour, his knowledge, and his devotion.

Horace Waller, F.R.G.S., who died on Feb. 22, at East Liss, Hants, at the age of 63, was widely known as a strong opponent of slavery. His sympathies were chiefly directed to Africa, whither he went in 1861 in connexion with the founding of the first branch of the Universities\' Missions to Central Africa in the regions that had just been explored by the efforts of Dr. Livingstone and Sir John Kirk. Mr. Waller was not then in orders, but he travelled out and afterwards worked with Bishop Mackenzie, being associated for some time also with Dr. Livingstone in the Zambesi and Shiré districts. Mr. Waller began life in a business house in London, and thus acquired a knowledge of the world and businesslike habits which often stood him in good stead. He was a close observer of nature and a keen sportsman, and his services to the mission were of the highest value. Returning to England on the death of Bishop Mackenzie, Mr. Waller took orders, and soon began to devote his energies to opposing the slave trade, an opposition which became one of the chief objects of his life. In 1867 he attended the British & Foreign Anti-Slavery Society\'s conference held in Paris in conjunction with the French and Spanish societies, and in 1870 he became a member of the Committee of the Society, an office which he retained to the time of his death. When, in 1871, the House of Commons decided to appoint a Select Committee to investigate the East African slave trade, it was owing mainly to the influence of Mr. Edmund Sturge, with Mr. Waller\'s assistance, that the Committee decided to recommend that the acting Political Agent at Zanzibar, Sir John Kirk, should receive the appointment of permanent Political Agent. This was followed in the course of 1873 by Sir Bartle Frere\'s anti-slavery mission to the East Coast of Africa, which eventually resulted in the treaty between the Sultan of Zanzibar and Great Britain which declared the slave trade by sea to be illegal. In the long-continued efforts made by Mr. Waller to put down the trade entirely, by means of letters in the columns of the newspapers, by pamphlets written for general circulation, and by speeches, he always emphasised the fact that by the treaty with Zanzibar in 1873 all slaves who had been imported into the islands since that date were illegally held in bondage, and when Zanzibar became a British protectorate his protests against what he called ""slavery under the British flag"" were redoubled. When Mr. H. M. Stanley succeeded in discovering Livingstone, the latter\'s voluminous journals were intrusted to the hands of Mr. Waller for publication, and were given to the public in two large volumes in 1875. The intimacy between Mr. Waller and the late General Gordon was of a very close and confidential kind, and it was in the rectory at Twywell that Gordon often sought a retreat from the pertinacious attention of correspondents anxious to obtain interviews with him. Mr. Waller had been rector of Twywell, Northants, since 1874. Before that he had held a curacy at Chatham and he had for four years been Vicar of Leytonstone. Last year Mr. Waller resigned his living at Twywell and removed to the more temperate climate of South Hants.'}]","[{'document_title': 'GEOGRAPHY OF AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""tent of country between the Tanganyika Lake of Burton and Speke, and the Zambesi and Shire of Livingstone? Are we not at this moment most anxious to determine by positive observation whether there exists a great series of lakes and rivers proceeding, as Cooley has suggested, from Tanganyika on the north, to Lake Nyassa on the south? and has not Livingstone's very last effort been directed to this point? If central Africa is ever to advance in civilization, and its inhabitants are to be brought into commercial relations with Europe, one of the best chances of our accomplishing it will, in my opinion, consist in rendering the great White Nile a highway of intercourse and traffic. And if the present ruler of Egypt shall bring about this most desirable end, by putting a stop to the lawless slave-trade, carried on beyond his frontiers under the guise of dealing in ivory, and by establishing marts of commerce on the banks of the great river, Africa will owe more to him than to any ruler since the days of the Roman emperors, who, though they tried, never succeeded in opening out the regions around the head waters of the Nile. In touching upon this subject, I have to congratulate you on the news which has arrived, that that chivalrous explorer, Mr. Samuel Baker, is successfully examining the central equatorial regions, from which, I trust, he will bring us the solution of some of the problems already adverted to, and will determine the real source of the waters which supply the Luta N'zigé of Speke and Grant. I have also to announce that Baron Von der Decken has proceeded on his bold adventure to explore the interior of Africa from the east coast, by ascending the Juba, or one of the adjacent rivers, with two river steamers constructed at his own cost. In making these allusions to African discovery, most heartily do I congratulate geographers on the safe return of my excellent and disinterested friend Livingstone. Already, after his first two great traverses from east to west and from west to east across South Africa, this undaunted missionary has won for himself imperishable renown. But now, after a second expatriation which has lasted upwards of six years (his previous journeys occupying sixteen years), during which he has been labouring conjointly to improve the condition of the natives and to extend geographical knowledge, he comes home with a firm resolution to adhere to his noble calling for the benefit of the natives, and to return to that country in which every black man must bless his name. The return also of Captain Burton ensures for us some fresh and pregnant communications respecting Western Africa; and when we know that Francis Galton, though much occupied with the duties of a general secretary, will always take part in our discussions, and that Barth is likely to be present, it is probable that we shall have a concourse of travellers, capable of illustrating the geography and ethnology of Africa, such as was never assembled at any former meeting."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1864#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE ""COMING"" CONTINENT.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In an article, entitled ""Africa for Africans,"" published in a magazine issued in Washington, U.S.A., the vast possibilities of progress and development possessed by this continent are so eloquently and aptly set forth that we quote the passage *in extenso*:\n\n""Africa is to-day the object of more interest on the part of a larger number of people than any other quarter of the globe. England, France, Portugal, Germany, and Italy are attempting to obtain titles to the country. England has made annexation of the coast lying adjacent to her colony of Sierra Leone; France is forcing her way on the Senegal and toward the head-waters of the Niger; she threatens to annex the coast from the Gaboon to the Congo, some 250 miles, and is running her lines on the Upper Congo. Her Chamber of Deputies has granted the De Brazza mission, by a vote of 449 to 3, a credit of a million and a quarter of francs. The Portuguese Government has appointed explorers and examined the Congo country, and assumes to exercise control over all the territory at the mouth of the Congo. The German Reichstag has increased its annual appropriation for the exploration of Africa. Italy has despatched a party to Abyssinia for geographical and mercantile purposes. She has also concluded treaties which promise to make Assab a centre of commerce. The Sultan of Morocco has authorized Spain to take possession of Santa Cruz del Mar, and the Sultan of Zanzibar has purchased six superior steamers to constitute a regular coast service, in the interest of commerce and for the suppression of the slave-trade. The International African Association, which owes its origin to the philanthropic initiative of Leopold II., King of the Belgians, has received large subscriptions and pushed forward exploring expeditions to start and equip the line of hospitable and scientific stations which are to bound the East and West Coast, and form a civilizing girdle around Central Africa. And the results following the explorations of Livingstone and Stanley and De Brazza are attracting the attention of the civilized world. What was a \'Dark Continent,\' by the indomitable energy of these explorers, seems likely to prove the richest quarter of the globe. Not only does the land produce, with slight persuasion of tillage, admirable crops of cotton and coffee, but the soil is rich in diamonds on its southern coast, and in iron on its northern.

All that has of late been done by the British Government for its total suppression, owes its origin to the good Doctor's fearless and untiring exposure of the enormous sin and crime being daily perpetrated in those countries. If the heart of the British people has been at all stirred within them against the monster iniquity perpetrated by Arabs and Portuguese in those vast regions which they were depopulating by its practice, it was the voice and pen of Livingstone that stirred it.

Notes written by Livingstone in October and November, 1867, from Marunga and Cazembe, places which lie S. and S.S.W. of Lake Tanganyika, have been received by Dr. Kirk at Zanzibar. Livingstone, it appears, when he last wrote, had been living for three months with a friendly Arab tribe, waiting for the close of a native war, before proceeding to Ujiji, with the intention of exploring Lake Tanganyika, and thence pushing on to Zanzibar. At Ujiji Livingstone would find provisions, medicine, letters, &c., and would learn the discoveries of Sir Samuel Baker. This information, Sir Roderick thinks, would induce him to attempt the solution of ""the great problem of the Nilotic watershed of Africa, by determining whether the great lakes (Albert Nyanza and Tanganyika) are united or separated by highlands, and if separated, by ascertaining into what river-system Tanganyika discharges its surplus waters."" Ten months would suffice, probably, to complete this work and to bring Livingstone to the seacoast.

It is indeed a compendium. It places before us in brief but luminous sketches, and with the aid of sixteen admirable maps and some seventy illustrations, all that is publicly known about Africa and its peoples—their specific peculiarities, character, manners, customs, and condition, physical and moral; with enumeration of its varied products, its trade and commerce. It is an admirable volume for all who desire general information respecting that great continent, into the dense darkness of which the light of civilization and Christianity has begun to penetrate, through the devoted exertions of missionaries and scientific explorers. Africa does not present us with any very pleasing pictures. They are all of barbarism, and for the most part barbarism of the lowest and most disgusting type, and yet such as awakes and impels to active exertion the warmest sympathies and desires of the Christian and philanthropist. Such books as this of Mr. Stanford\'s are particularly valuable in view of the extremely limited degree of information respecting Africa possessed even by the majority of well-educated people in England. So many active agencies are now at work in and for Africa that some more intimate knowledge of it must be desired; while yet the labour of wading through long and dreary books of African travel, with their sadly monotonous succession of pictures of sparsely-inhabited countries, and of ignorance, suffering, cruelty, and moral degradation everywhere, deters most people from seeking it in their pages. This ""Compendium"" meets such desires, and gets rid of such difficulties, offering as a prize to be gained by a few leisure hours\' reading all that it is essential well-educated people should know of this great continent. The degree of knowledge thus to be obtained may lead some whose attention has not hitherto been called in that direction to desires and sympathies with regard to that long-neglected quarter of the world, and its wretched populations.

After alluding to the services which Scotland has rendered to geographical science, especially in the person of Livingstone, Mr. O\'Neill described the circumstances which induced him to resolve to fill up, as far as possible, the great blank in the map of Eastern Africa. The results of his journeys Mr. O\'Neill summarised as follows:—\n\n""Briefly, the chief results have been to open up three new routes between the Nyassa district and the coast: 1, between Mozambique and Lake Shirwa and Blantyre; 2, from Blantyre to the Portuguese settlements of Angoche and Parapato; 3, from Quillimane to Blantyre. You know the length of time it took to get overland to Lake Nyassa from the east coast. Many of you remember the hardships encountered by Bishop Steere when getting over the same ground. The Nyassa may now be reached by the longest route in thirty days, and by that from Quillimane to Blantyre in fourteen. The country you pass over is well-populated, food abundant, and the people peaceable, helpful, and industrious. There are difficulties of course, African travel is never without them; but any or all of the three routes I have laid down may be constantly traversed by Europeans, and become most valuable channels for the development of the trade and agriculture of the country. In my journeys I have been fortunate enough to discover three minor lakes: one, Lake Lidedi, just south of the Rovuma, and close to Lake Nargadi, of which Livingstone first heard as he passed north of that river upon his last travels. The others are Lake Amaramba and Cheuta, which have their outlet in the River Lujenda. When in the neighbourhood of these lakes I closely investigated the question of the supposed connexion of Lake Shirwa with the Lujenda drainage system, and satisfied myself that there was no point of junction between them. Lake Shirwa is divided from the Lakes Cheuta and Amaramba by a broad elevated ridge of sandy soil, lightly wooded and covered with thick undergrowth, and I have nowhere detected trace of inundation or evidence of the rising of Lake Shirwa above the level of its foot. It is possible that a subterranean junction exists, and this view is held by many natives.""\n\nMr. O\'Neill dwelt upon the importance of a reliable meridian in the interior for the traveller. He described the very interesting evidences of glacial action met with in the hilly regions, and stated he had never met with any traces of subsequent volcanic action, and that he doubts the hypotheses respecting volcanic disturbance. Remarking that though Eastern Africa has not the exuberant vegetation or magnificent forests of Brazil, the Congo region, and other parts of the world, Mr. O\'Neill added that the air is drier, there is less malaria, and the country is more fit for the residence of Europeans.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-07-08', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1885#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MR.

The very atmosphere was electric with the most wonderful schemes—religious, philanthropic, and commercial—for the exclusive benefit of the negro. From platform and pulpit rose a clamour of voices, in which was heard the popular watchwords of the day—civilisation, progress, the good of the negro, legitimate commerce, conversion of the heathen, and other high-sounding phrases, all having relation to the good things to be done for the African. The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation. They never heard now of the trader who went to Africa with the merely selfish object of making his fortune. Each and all became pioneers of civilisation, thinking only of the native first and self afterwards. They spoke as if the good to the native had been enormous, and that their intercourse with him had been a benefit and blessing. They pointed with pride to their sacrifices in the suppression of the slave trade, to their West Coast settlements as centres of secular light and leading; to their missionary stations as stars twinkling in the night of heathendom; to the returns of their trade with every entrance to the heart of Africa, as showing the spread of their beneficial influence. They saw that the work of other nations had been pernicious in the extreme, that they had been brutal in their dealings with native races, and had thought only of their own sordid interests and national aggrandisement—all in marked contrast to their aims and methods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE PARTITION OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the Royal Institution, London, on April 7, Mr. J.

The lecture was illustrated by maps.\n\nMr. Scott Keltie began by remarking that during the past six years we had seen the bulk of a great continent parcelled out among a few great Powers. That continent was no new discovery. It was not a new world like America or Australia. It entered into the oldest traditions and the most ancient history. Long, indeed, before Greece entered the field, while yet Europe was the home of wandering barbarians, long even before Abraham left his father\'s fields, before the Phœnicians had settled themselves on the Syrian coast, one of the most wonderful civilisations on record had begun to work out its destiny on the banks of that Nile, the mystery of whose source, so long sought for, had been solved only within present memory. It was not the present business to discuss the origin or trace the history of Egypt. It was enough that the continent on which the oldest, or at least one of the oldest, civilisations was born and was developed through thousands of years, was even now less known than a continent discovered only 400 years ago, and had only during the last few years been taken seriously in hand by the peoples who had the making of the world\'s commerce and the world\'s history. It was only just 400 years since Columbus stumbled upon the New World, and yet what was in brief the history of America? It was now the home of 130,000,000 of people of European origin. It was, indeed, another Europe. The first British colonial settlement was planted in Australia little more than a century since, and it was only fifty years since that the continents there had had a free hand. Now they had 4,000,000 of people of European origin, mainly of British descent, whose trade was of the value of £120,000,000 sterling a year.\n\nThis was to be contrasted with what had taken place in Africa.

1002,Media outlets like the African Times played a crucial role in shaping global perceptions and influencing colonial policies regarding African affairs during the 19th century.,"The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times articles provide complementary insights into the role of media outlets in shaping global perceptions and influencing colonial policies regarding African affairs during the 19th century. The General History of Africa highlights the significant impact of newspapers, pamphlets, and journals in mobilizing anti-colonial sentiment and disseminating nationalist ideas across Africa, particularly during the inter-war period. These publications served as vital organs for anti-colonial propaganda and posed challenges for colonial administrators in controlling their influence. However, the textbook does not specifically mention the African Times in this context, listing it only among other publications without detailing its specific influence. In contrast, The African Times articles provide evidence supporting the claim that media outlets like the African Times played a crucial role in shaping perceptions and influencing colonial policies. The articles emphasize the African Times' efforts to advocate for African interests, expose abuses, and promote good governance in British African colonies, thereby influencing British public opinion. The publication is noted for its role in advocating for the Christian civilization and industrial development of Africa, indicating its impact on shaping perceptions. Despite the lack of explicit mention of direct influence on specific colonial policies, the African Times is portrayed as an important medium for raising awareness and advocating for African interests during the 19th century. Together, these sources suggest that while media outlets were indeed crucial in shaping perceptions and influencing policies, the specific role of the African Times in this process is more clearly articulated in its own articles than in the General History of Africa textbook.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several insights into the role of media outlets in shaping perceptions and influencing colonial policies, though it does not specifically mention the African Times in this context.

Euro-African contacts, which until the beginning of our period had been confined largely to the coastal peripheries, were, in the period under review, steadily extended inland as a result of the Industrial Revolution, largely through the efforts first of explorers, then traders and, finally, missionaries. This steady extension of European contacts and influence inland included not only guns and powder, but also railways, telegraphs, agricultural and mining machinery, the print› ing press, technical education and, above all, finance capital. These new developments created opportunities, but also challenges and dangers. Among the most novel and interesting features of African history during the period were the initiatives and reactions of African rulers and advisers in the face of these opportunities and challenges. It would appear that in most cases the approach of the Africans was not simply one of blind imitation or wholesale substitution but rather one of adaptation and syn› thesis. Instances of this process of modernization in Africa are legion. 56 Egypt built its first printing press at Büläk, Cairo, in 1822; the first printing press was established in Portuguese Luanda in 1841; the first modern mines were opened in Algeria in 1845 and in the Gold Coast in the 1870s.

Apart from those published within Africa, a fair number also came from outside the continent serving as vehicles for transmission of the anti-colonial and anti-imperialist propaganda of inter› national movements. The appearance of these papers varied from daily, weekly, fortnightly to monthly. Others were published only when it was possible. A number of the newspapers and periodicals had been in existence before the First World War. Such were al-Liwa, an Arabic newspaper founded in 1900 to popularize Egyptian nationalist ideas, La DØmocratie du SØnØgal, and The Lagos Weekly Record founded in 1891. The majority were, however, founded in the inter-war period. Such were the Times of Nigeria (1921-30), Daily Times (from 1926), Lagos Daily News (1925-38), Le PØriscope Africain (Dakar, 1929), L'Ouest-Africain Français (Journal RØpublicain-Socialiste), Le Courrier de l'Ouest-Africain (Dakar), the African Morning Post, The Gold Coast Times (Accra), L'Action Tunisienne (1932) and La Presse Porto-Novienne with sub-titles and a section in Yoruba. Newspapers in African languages, other than the Egyptian al-Liwa, included the Yoruba language paper, Akede Eko (Lagos, 1932 onwards) and La Voix du Dahomey. From outside Africa came communist-inspired and pan-African periodicals like the Race NŁgre, Negro World, La Voix des NŁgres, and Vox Populi, as well as New Times and Ethiopia News, the Cri des NŁgres, African Times and Orient Review, The Crusader, and New York Age and Coloured American.

The fact was that for the non-Muslim areas of Africa probably the most important single innovation of foreign rule was literacy. Even for the Islamized areas, the coming of literacy in the Roman script gave a new impetus to Muslim education. Literacy was for many African peoples a new magic, and was sought after as such and at all costs since it appeared to open the treasure house of the modern world. To know the amount of power, authority and influence which the first generation of African clerks, interpreters and teachers exercised is to have some idea of the spell which literacy cast over many African peoples.

Blyden concluded: During all the years which have elapsed since the commencement of modern progress, the African race has filled a very humble and subordinate part in the work of human civilization. But the march of events is developing the interesting fact that there is a career before this people which no other people can enter upon. There is a peculiar work for them to accomplish, both in the land of their bondage, and in the land of their fathers, which no other people can achieve. With the present prospects and privileges before his race - with the chances of arduous work, noble suffering, and magnificent achievement before them - I would rather be a member of this race than a Greek in the time of Alexander, a Roman in the Augustin period, or an AngloSaxon in the nineteenth century. 46 It was also Blyden who in his famous speech to the American Col› onization Society in May 1880 gave great publicity to the phrase 'Ethiopia Stretching Out her Hands Unto God' and equated Ethiopian with African; and it was he who first used the term 'African personality' in his lecture delivered on 19 May 1893 in Freetown when he described the African Race as 'a Great Race - great in its vitality, in its power of endurance and its prospect of perpetuity'. He continued: It is sad to think that there are some Africans, especially among those who have enjoyed the advantages of foreign training, who are so blind to the radical facts of humanity as to say, 'Let us do away with the sentiment of Race. Let us do away with our African personality and be if possible in another Race ... Preach this doctrine as much as you like, no one will do it, for no one can do it, for when you have done away with your personality, you have done away with yourselves ... the duty of every man, of every race is to contend for its individuality to keep and develop it ... Therefore, honour and love your Race ... If you are not yourself, if you surrender your personality, you have nothing left to give to the world .. . 47 Another great leader of the intellectual revolution of the time was undoubtedly that fiery Yoruba-Creole evangelist, James Johnson (c. 18361917).

The activities of four persons dominated the develop› ment of formal, organized pan-Africanism during the colonial period. The first was Booker T.

The reputation and resources of Tuskegee, however, were brought to Africa by African and American alumni and, often, by numerous African visitors to Tuskegee or correspondents with Washington who had never been matriculated students. Consequently, through the media of numerous international conferences, visitations, and technical missions, many Africans were touched by the 'Tuskegee Spirit' or drew upon Tuskegee's and other American black resources."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Black American evangelism in Africa', 'content': ""Indeed, Afro-Americans in the nineteenth century were exhorted to assume a special stance toward the 'redemption' of African societies.

In August 1893, African and other participants from the United States and Europe attended an American Missionary Association 'World Congress on Africa', held in conjunction with the Chicago World Fair of that year.

Some twenty or thirty thousand rejoicing people lined the roads (Mtesa has good wide roads, bordered by trees) and attended him to the royal residence. There were no excesses, no sights or sounds of cruelty or woe. Stanley writes of the roads around the capital as 50 to 200 feet broad, skirted with well-kept gardens and pasture lands. ""The day after our arrival,"" he adds, ""I was introduced to the royal palace in great state. None of the primitive scenes related in Speke\'s book were now visible there. The guards, clothed in white cotton dresses, were by no means comical, as then. The chiefs were very respectable-looking people, dressed chiefly in the Arab costume."" Mr. Stanley, after being a short time there, alludes in a second letter, which accompanied the first, to conversations he had with King Mtesa, and the results. King Mtesa\'s Islamism, it must be borne in mind, was only four or five years old, so that the bigotry of habit had not taken possession of him or his people. Mr. Stanley\'s conversations seem to have been blessed to his conviction that there was something to be sought superior to Islamism, and he expressed the deepest anxiety that Christian missionaries should be sent to his country, promising them ample protection and encouragement. King Mtesa had determined, until better instructed, to observe the Christian in addition to the Mosaic Sabbath. He had the Ten Commandments of Moses written in Arabic on a board for his daily perusal; and in addition, the Lord\'s Prayer and the golden Commandment, ""Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."" Could any one deny that the way seems to be prepared by the providence of God for the preaching of the Gospel of salvation and eternal life in Uganda? King Mtesa\'s territory extends to some 200 or 300 miles in length, and some 50 to 100 in breadth. Mr. Stanley wound up by an urgent appeal to missionary societies and the friends of Africa to enter upon this promising field of labour. He particularized what should be done, and suggested that 5,000l. would suffice for the preliminary effort. Immediately we read his letter we sent to one who has wealth and a warm heart for God\'s cause, asking him to supply the funds. We think he most likely would have supplied them, but other hearts had been moved as well as ours, and before three days had passed, the letter, of which we have given copy, was sent to the Church Missionary Society, and the 5,000l. was at their disposal. A further sum of 3,000l. has since been given by another earnest friend. It will be seen that, after earnest and prayerful deliberation, the Committee of the Church Missionary Society have resolved to accept the gift, to undertake the work, and to open a special fund for the Uganda or King Mtesa\'s Mission. The way in which God is overruling the actions of men to the opening of channels through which the Divine light may penetrate the thick darkness of heathen Africa, is indeed marvellous. Livingstone, the devoted and glorious pioneer, spent his life in the effort to open one into Central Africa; the Oxford and Cambridge Mission, formed to second his efforts by way of the Zambesi, failed; and he died without any visible result to his labours, beyond his having sowed the seed of a deep interest in those regions among the Christian people of Great Britain. Long lost to sight and knowledge during his last eventful expedition, Mr. Bennett, proprietor of the New York Herald, dispatched Mr. Stanley to discover and succour him should he be still alive, or to obtain information as to his death should he have perished. How well he fulfilled his mission has been amply recorded. When the sad intelligence of his death, and subsequently his honoured remains, reached England, and when it was evident that no further funds were forthcoming for further exploration from the sources whence they had been hitherto drawn, the united proprietors of the London Daily Telegraph and the New York Herald nobly supplied the necessary means, and dispatched Mr. Stanley to complete the geographical discoveries of him who was no more. He has admirably performed his geographical task; and not only this, but events seem to be now indeed proving that he was the unconscious agent of a far higher Power—of a Divine power—which was directing and ordering his course, that he might be the means for accomplishing that higher design of the devoted Livingstone—the opening a channel for the diffusion of the sacred truths of the everlasting Gospel in Central Africa. We cannot doubt that the Divine blessing will attend the efforts which the Church Missionary Society are now about to make in the channel thus opened. The prayers of all Christian Africans ought to be united with those of British Christians that God will give to them a great success, to the praise and glory of His name, and of that of our dear Redeemer, His beloved Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. This great intelligence will reach them through our columns, when they are rejoicing that their Lord and Saviour was born in Bethlehem; and we call upon them to rejoice also that the dark centre of their continent, is about to hear of His great salvation.'}, {'id': 5540, 'article_title': 'Produce Markets', 'full_section_title': 'Produce Markets', 'last_edit_date': '04-01-1887', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_05_1887#article-15', 'issue_date': '02_05_1887', 'content': 'F.

The African Times now occupies an acknowledged position as the registrar and exponent of native wants and progress, and the advocate of native interests, more especially on the West Coast. Our aim in the future will ever be, as it has been in the past, to make it practically useful; and we again solicit the support of all who have at heart the real welfare of native Africa and its people, both for this Journal and for the Society by which it was founded, and to whose efforts with Government and individuals so much of its power for good may be attributed. And more especially do we commend the African Times and the African-Aid Society to the warm and earnest support of the educated Africans of the West Coast. The African Times brings them, as well as their rulers, face to face with British public opinion, by which they have much to gain in the work to which we hope they all feel themselves pledged—viz., that of the Christian civilization of the whole African people, and the industrial development of those great natural resources with which Africa has been so liberally endowed.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-07-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_07_1865#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.717, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Another Letter from Livingstone', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—We cannot allow 1871 to pass away without expressing our gratefulness and high appreciation of the philanthropic feelings by which you are impelled to advocate the cause of Africa and her injured myriads from beneath the lash of official tyranny and oppression, and from the taunts, scoffs, and political venom of the negro-haters. When we review the history of our country from the time of the publication of that valuable journal of which you are the honoured editor—a periodical which stands eminent in consequence of the incalculable benefit it has conferred upon us—we say, when we contrast Africa\'s past with her present; when we look upon the many moral changes the African Times has effected, we could not but classify it amongst the means employed by Divine goodness towards the regeneration of a people who, according to the views of the anthropologist, are deprived of that vital essence which constitutes man the chief of God\'s creatures; hence with them the negro is calculated to be unfit for any other position than to become ""a beast of burden and a beast for prey"" to his more favoured brother. But the African Times has declared in the most forcible language that the negroes with the whites ""are made of one blood,"" and are equally fitted to occupy the same position amongst the works of creation.\n\nNot to enumerate its past achievements, the African Times, being animated with the most ardent zeal for our true interest, has contended with the Colonial-office in order to restore to Her Majesty African subjects that most inestimable benefit, which is the life of liberty, in the British Constitution, ""trial by jury,"" which we cannot avoid lamenting.

During eight years we have endeavoured to advocate in its columns, honestly, temperately, and fearlessly, the true interests of the West African countries, their people, and the merchants engaged in commerce with them. Great changes have taken place since the issue of the African Times commenced. The slave trade, which was then carrying off victims from the coasts of Dahomey and from the Congo, seems now to be entirely at an end, we hope and believe never to be again revived. At that period there was steam communication once a month between Liverpool and the West Coast ports; now, thanks to the establishment of the new line, there are four steam vessels to be despatched per month. This last important change ought to operate as a powerful stimulus to production and commerce, giving, as it will, so much greater facilities to the native traders to utilise their comparatively small capital in direct operation with Great Britain. With regard to the British settlements, trade and commerce cannot be expected to take their due development, until those administrative and judicial abuses which have been and will continue to be exposed and denounced by us shall have ceased. It cannot be said that life and property are safe in them while the authorities, executive and judicial, are guilty of the most illegal and arbitrary acts, and are allowed by the Colonial-office to perpetrate such acts with impunity instead of being immediately cashiered for them. But since this inclination on the part of the Home Government to throw the shield of its protection over culpable officials, rather than over the people among whom they exercise authority in its name, does unhappily exist, as recent facts most incontestably prove, it only becomes the more indispensable to create and organise a public opinion in the British settlements on the Coast that shall be powerful enough to secure for the governed a due attention to their grievances by Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, and prompt redress at his hands. To this creation and organisation of an African public opinion our most strenuous efforts will be directed in the future, as they have been incessantly in the past; and looking at what we have done in this direction during the past eight years, we think we are justified in demanding a much more liberal support from all classes on the West Coast of Africa than we have hitherto received. We have endeavoured conscientiously and zealously, without fear or favour, to carry on the work which God has put it into our hearts and hands to do, and has therefore charged us with; and those for whose present protection and permanent interests we labour have a duty also to perform towards us. We hope they will not fail in it, and in this hope we purpose (D.V.) to commence next month the ninth year's issue of the African Times."", 'last_edit_date': '1869-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1869#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TRIBUTE TO THE ""AFRICAN TIMES.""', 'section_title': '', 'content': '[We cannot refrain from making the following brief extracts from the letter of a valued correspondent.

In Western Africa our sphere of influence is confined to the Guinea Coast and the Niger Basin. Here, however, we have quite sufficient to occupy our attention and our enterprise. Our actual possessions in West Africa are limited to the Gambia River, the Sierra Leone Colony, the Gold Coast, Lagos, the Oil Rivers, and the Niger and Binué.\n\nWhat we want is concentration and the filling up of the gaps in the coast line. We must abandon the now useless Gambia, annex or protect the Ivory Coast, eastwards of Liberia, acquire by friendly arrangement the French possessions on the Gold Coast and on the slave coast, get the Germans to exchange Togoland for Walfisch Bay, replace the Portuguese in the protectorate of the Dahomey coast which they have abandoned, and we shall then possess the entire seaboard of West Africa, with the exception of Liberia, from Sierra Leone to the German boundary in Cameroons. Any one will see that this is not a very large operation, and it may be effected by coming to terms with the French. Indeed, it would be well to make some arrangement with the French on the west such as the agreement we made with Germany on the east, by which the sphere of each Power is defined and both nations can continue their work quietly and without dread of each other\'s encroachments. France might take the left bank of the River Niger as far as Timbuctoo, and we the right bank as our boundary, and from a point on the Upper Niger near Falaba the frontier could be carried to the Little Scarcies River and to the sea, thus cutting off a small portion of the present Sierra Leone colony.

During that period the whole of the anxiety, labour, and responsibility, both public and pecuniary, which it has involved, have been borne by one individual, the Editor. When first started, he undertook, subject to the condition of a certain number of copies being subscribed for individually by some members of the Council of the African-Aid Society, that it should never involve that society in any pecuniary loss or responsibility. Contrary to his opinion as to the conditions under which a public journal could be successfully conducted, and submitted to by him solely with the object of facilitating its establishment, a committee of a few members of the council of that society was appointed to meet monthly, prior to its publication, for considering the articles, &c., which the Editor had decided to insert. But to this the Editor attached a stipulation that he would not consent to any alterations of which he did not himself fully approve, and which he did not consider advisable or innocuous. Such a committee of course could not work, and the Editor freed himself almost immediately from the nominal restriction, which only served to increase the difficulty of bringing out the paper on the proper day, without effecting any useful purpose whatever. A perfect and entire independence of thought and opinion in the editor is essential to the success of any and every public journal. During five years, therefore, the whole labour and responsibility have, as before stated, rested with one individual, the present Editor. Such an anniversary as this is therefore a solemn one with us. The objects the Editor has endeavoured ever to keep in view have been the promotion of good government in the British African colonies and settlements, to force a removal of official abuses, to promote material development and increased facilities of transit and trade, as auxiliaries to missionary effort, and as indispensable, not to the reception of Christianity, but to the existence and spread of Christian civilization in Africa. Having entered upon this work with a deep sense of responsibility to God, we feel bound to ask ourselves how that work has been performed. With the measure and extent of its success we have nothing to do, that we leave in the hands of Him who worketh through individual agencies on the earth, according to His own infinite wisdom. But have we done our duty by the African people, and have they, on their side, done their duty towards us? As regards the former, we can only look to our motives and our desires. We have endeavoured to keep a watchful guard over ourselves as ""one who must give an account before God,"" and we have, with no small sacrifice of time and rest, conscientiously striven to give to Africa in our labours whatever talent or wisdom God may have bestowed upon us for that purpose. As regards the latter, we think we have cause of rejoicing rather than of complaint. The number of our African subscribers has continuously increased, filling up, in a way most satisfactory to us, the gaps in our subscription list caused by the withdrawals of those of our early friends who considered, we suppose, that no further effort on their part was necessary to our support. And we have given a voice—a public voice to Africa. Few people in England, unfortunately, care much about her or her concerns. The English Anti-Slavery party, fully occupied in their high and noble object of the eradication of negro slavery everywhere, have not yet had time generally to recognise the importance of paving the way, and preparing for, and aiding in the work of Christian civilization in Africa itself. Many of the few who do care about Africa have from time to time taken exception to some opinion put forth by us, and, overlooking the', 'last_edit_date': '1866-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1866#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Editorial', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'COMMENCING with the present number, the size of the African Times is permanently increased to sixteen pages.

The words should be written in letters of gold, and be engraven in the heart of every true and honest African from one generation to another.

But they have not as yet done anything for the support of The Society whose influence makes that journal a power. In future every subscription will be published in this paper. Every educated and commercial African ought to feel that this society is his. The name of every one ought to be found year by year in the list of its annual subscribers. There are hundreds who can afford their one or two guineas a-year. It is only thus they can show that they recognise the important efforts of this society for them and for their race and country; thus only they can show that they are alive to the vast benefits of the civilization of which they have themselves become partakers. It was for this that we hailed with peculiar satisfaction the annual subscription of the Rev. Mr. Robbin, Colonial Chaplain at the Gambia, as announced in our last. His worthy and honoured name stands first on the list of our African subscribers. We hope, for the credit of the educated Africans, that it is but the first of hundreds.

It should be borne in mind that originally the journal was of only eight pages of a smaller-sized paper—that gradually it was increased to twelve, and frequently during the past six months to sixteen. But there is no engagement to continue to furnish such a quantity monthly, although the intention is to do so if the funds will allow. The paper is edited and conducted gratuitously; and all that can be obtained from the sale of copies and from advertisements is devoted to its improvement and enlargement. But unless a special fund were raised for the paper the Editor cannot risk loss. Eight pages of the size now issued are nearly equal to twelve of the previous size. The Editor hopes, however, by the blessing of God, to maintain the issue at twelve, and even at sixteen pages of the new and increased size. Subscribers may aid in this by obtaining ADVERTISEMENTS and other SUBSCRIBERS for the journal, without which it cannot be accomplished. They should bear in mind that although their five shillings per annum per copy, including postage or delivery, is a shilling or two a-year dearer than some other journals of a similar size and paper are supplied at, the AFRICAN TIMES is a special paper, that will only be taken by a special class of readers—that it cannot hope to be popularised into cheapness except as education and civilization progress on the West Coast of Africa—and that in return for that individual sacrifice of a shilling or two a-year the Editor gives time, anxiety, and such little talent as he may possess, without any reward, save the hope that he may be in some measure advancing the great cause of Christian civilization and industrial development in Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1865#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.71, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SUBSCRIPTIONS AND ADVERTISEMENTS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The African Times being now at the sole risk and charge of one individual, it becomes indispensable so to increase its revenues as to insure their being adequate to meet the outlay which the publication, office management, &c., of the journal involve.

1015,"Colonial journalism in British Western Africa struggled to report injustices and corruption due to accusations of bias, local opposition, and the risk of libel.","The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced view of the challenges faced by colonial journalism in British Western Africa. The General History of Africa highlights the role of newspapers in promoting nationalist and anti-colonial activities, which concerned colonial administrators and led to the implementation of sedition laws in the mid-1930s. This suggests that colonial journalism was active in reporting injustices and corruption, focusing on political and economic reforms and the formation of organizations like the National Congress of British West Africa. However, the textbook does not specifically mention accusations of bias, local opposition, or the risk of libel as obstacles, indicating a divergence from the claim. In contrast, The African Times articles provide detailed accounts supporting the claim, emphasizing the challenges of accusations of bias, local opposition, and the risk of libel. The African Times faced criticism for both concealing wrongs and daring to interfere, highlighting the delicate balance in reporting sensitive issues. The risk of libel was evident in their cautious approach to publishing details of criminal cases and the costly libel proceedings initiated by Captain Rattray. Despite these challenges, the African Times demonstrated a commitment to exposing corruption and injustices, underscoring their role as public guardians of humanity and progress. Together, these sources illustrate the complex landscape of colonial journalism, where determination to report injustices coexisted with significant obstacles.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several insights that both support and refute the claim regarding colonial journalism in British Western Africa. The text highlights that newspapers served as a medium for diffusing nationalist and anti-colonial activities, which were a source of concern for colonial administrators, as evidenced by the sedition laws of the mid-1930s. This suggests that colonial journalism was indeed active in reporting injustices and corruption, despite the challenges posed by colonial authorities. However, the text does not specifically mention accusations of bias, local opposition, or the risk of libel as obstacles faced by journalists. Instead, it emphasizes the role of newspapers in advocating for political and economic reforms and the formation of organizations like the National Congress of British West Africa. The absence of specific references to accusations of bias or libel in the textbook indicates a difference from the claim, suggesting that while colonial journalism faced challenges, these were not necessarily centered around bias or libel as the claim suggests.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that colonial journalism in British Western Africa faced challenges in reporting injustices and corruption due to accusations of bias, local opposition, and the risk of libel. The articles highlight the difficulties faced by the African Times in publishing revelations about wrongs and abuses, as they were often accused of bias and faced opposition from local authorities and individuals. For instance, the publication was criticized for both concealing wrongs and daring to interfere, indicating a delicate balance in reporting sensitive issues. Additionally, the articles mention the risk of libel, as seen in the decision to refrain from publishing certain details of a criminal case due to potential identification and legal repercussions. The African Times also faced legal threats, such as the libel proceedings initiated by Captain Rattray, which resulted in a costly settlement. These examples illustrate the challenges colonial journalists encountered in exposing corruption and injustices, aligning with the claim. However, the articles also show the African Times' commitment to reporting these issues despite the risks, suggesting a determination to fulfill their role as public guardians of humanity and progress. This determination, despite the challenges, adds a nuanced perspective to the claim.",True,1015,Colonial Narratives and Perceptions,Impact of Media on Local and Colonial Perspectives,"[{'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': 'Literature in European languages', 'content': ""Literary culture in European languages in West and Central Africa may be said to have constituted the highest force of colonial confrontation. Oral literature retained its place as a satirical outlet, so did mime, dance and innovations in masquerade forms to take note of and make commentaries on the colonial phenomenon. But it was the colonial language literatures in journalistic form and in poetry, drama and the novel, which mobilized the literary imagination in the service of anti-colonialism.$^{42}$ The West African coast, from Liberia to Lagos, nourished the pamphlet industry on a scale that is comparable to eighteenth-century England. So did Kenya although, in the East African case, this appeared to have been largely in the hands of the Asian community, as were most of the journals. The brief tract, cheaply printed and easily disseminated, launched tirades against foreign domina› tion and exploitation, against acts of deceit by the colonial administration and the ever-increasing encroachments on the life style and social dignity of the peoples. Portuguese Luanda for its part obtained its first printing press in 1841 and with it the commencement of active journalism in the championing of the Africans' cause. It was a period remarked for its stylistic consciousness - no matter in which colonial language.

Thus, despite his genuine gratitude, even obsequious conduct towards British audiences and potential philanthropists, a William Grant of the West African Reporter could write (or permit to appear) the following searing indictment in his journal in 1882: It continues to be a standing blot upon the intercourse of Europeans with Africa, that every steamer that comes to the coast ... brings in large quantities of that which is comparatively worthless to be exchanged for that which is valuable and useful... If the articles given were simply worthless but harmless gew-gaws in exchange for articles of value, the morality of the transaction would even be reprehensible, but how much more when the articles are not only of trifling value ... but often positively destructive. They take home that which builds them up in wealth, often leaving to the African that which im› poverishes and destroys him. It is a sad reflection that, in many cases, European commerce has left its African customer as naked as it found him ... they will never secure a footing in Africa for their ideas of civilization, until the commercial relations between the high-toned, enlightened European and the 'savage' African, are placed upon a more equitable basis. But so long as demijohn follows demijohn of rum ... no reinforcements of missionaries and no homilies from professional philanthropists, on the blessing of European civilization will avail anything. 43 An ardent campaigner for Africa-oriented educational reforms, Grant, deeply influenced by Blyden, sought an educational system which had the university at its apex but only as an institution which was designed to provide research and teaching in fields related to Africa, as opposed to the 'conventional literary education which emphasized European culture and values'. You must, he wrote, 'educate him [the African] by himself. The annals of the Aborigines Rights Protection Society of the Gold Coast in the 1910s and 1920s, notably the speeches of J. E.

The ARPS was easily the most active. It was formed to protest against the Land Bill of 1896 which was to give control of all so-called waste or unoccupied lands to the government. As a result of a delegation it dispatched to London in 1898 which met the Secretary of State for Colonies, this obnoxious Bill was withdrawn. From then on, the ARPS sent a series of petitions to the local administration as well as the Colonial Office protesting against various projected Bills. It sent two delegations to England, one in 1906 to demand the repeal of the 1894 Towns Ordinance and the second in 1911 to oppose the Forestry Bill of 1910. It was certainly the most successful of the mouthpieces of the elite and traditional rulers of West Africa and the greatest opponent of colonialism until the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa after the First World War. In French West Africa, the Young Senegalese Club formed in 1910 also actively campaigned for equal rights.\nIt should be evident from this discussion that the peoples of West Africa devised all kinds of strategies and tactics first to oppose the establish› ment of the colonial system and second, after the failure of their early efforts, to resist certain specific measures and institutions of the system.

Throughout this period editorials vigorously denounced and carefully documented the abuses inherent in the system of chíbalo. They protested against the brutal methods used by African sepÆis to recruit forced labour, the low wages and poor working conditions of the chíbalo labourers and the arbitrary and capricious actions of the European overseers. The editors were particularly incensed by the common practice of seizing 'African women to repair and construct roads, not even supplying them with food nor paying them a salary', while 'forcing them during the rainy season to sleep in mud-huts, beside the road, like slaves'. 105 The newspapers also unleashed a broadside attack on the conditions of employment of free African workers. They deplored the fact that peasants and nominally free agricultural workers were compelled to work on Euro› pean estates 'from sunrise until sunset earning hardly a shilling a month', that Mozambicans working in the South African mines are 'denied the right to select their own employers ... and die like flies in the mines', that African workers are arrested and beaten if they lack proper identifica› tion, and that the state used chíbalo labourers to break strikes and drive down wages of free workers.$^{106}$ The informal colour bar conventions, which froze Africans in the lowest paying jobs while reserving the most desirable employment for Europeans, was also the target of several editorials."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Foreign intervention in Liberia and Ethiopia, 1915-35 > Liberia', 'content': 'First, the Liberian government\'s penury and perennial indebtedness partly led to increased foreign control of Liberia\'s financial administration by the International Receivership, the Bank of British West Africa, and Firestone interests supported by the United States government.

Secondly, Liberia\'s unfavourable economic, social and administrative conditions became a major issue in the bitter political rivalry between the True Whig and People\'s parties and attracted considerable international attention.

Simultaneously, it reported favourably on Faulkner as a \'progressiveminded citizen\'.$^{79}$ Earlier, too, in 1929, the British press had carried several editorials highly critical of the Liberian government. More importantly, the reports in both the American and British press and other reports by foreign missionaries and visitors accused the Liberian government and certain influential Americo-Liberians of practising slavery, recruiting forced and indentured labour, and exporting or selling migrant labour to European colonies especially to the Spanish island-colony of Fernando Po. 80 Britain spearheaded the foreign attack, condemning the exports and demanding, as in 1907-9, that to ameliorate the unfavourable conditions in Liberia, her government should be placed under European control. 81 The United States similarly berated Liberia about \'the so-called ""export"" of labour from Liberia to Fernando Po ... which seems hardly distinguish› able from organized slave trade\'.

Though directed against the Levantines (who were accused of creating scarcity by hoarding essential commodities, and of elbowing out local middlemen), these riots were in fact a violent and uncoordinated protest against what were believed to be injustices arising from the manage› ment of the colonial economy. The looting and the riots spread from Free› town to Moyamba, Kangahun (25-26 July 1919), Mano, Boia, Makump, Bo, Bonthe, Mange and Port Lokko. The situation was so serious that troops had to be brought in from the Gold Coast. In addition to the riots, the technical staff and labourers on the railway and in the public works department went on strike, demanding the same war bonus paid to the government clerical staff, and complaining of low wages and rising food prices.$^{2}$ In The Gambia, too, rising prices had their social and political effects, leading to sporadic outbursts of looting and petty theft, as well as a seamen's strike for better wages, and to the formation of unions, notably the Gambia Native Defensive Union.\nThe 1921 slump also led to more agitation from West African merchants, a few of whom were financially ruined. The issue of paper currency and shortage of silver did not improve matters either, and the European merchants were accused of hoarding the currency notes and charging high prices. According to one Gold Coast newspaper, 'The kings, chiefs, and all classes will soon be paupers' unless West Africans got together to protect themselves against the wily manoeuvres of combine magnates. In general, then, all these economic hardships led the West African press to advocate the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA), and the abolition of the Crown Colony system of administration to enable Africans to have more say in the running of the economy and more representation in the administrative and legislative bodies."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'Politics and nationalism in British West Africa > Inter-territorial movements and international movements: the National Congress of British West Africa', 'content': ""They complained of the post-war fiscal and economic controls and the growing power of extra-territorial firms.

To that extent, they were a constant source of worry for colonial administrators as the various sedition laws of the mid-i93os and the attempts to establish iron curtains by legislation against certain publications show. The spread of the radio later made the repressive measures which colonial rulers adopted to screen away their colonies from external influences more difficult and less effective.\nAs has been emphasized, constitutionalism, and the use of newspapers and radio as media of expression, were dependent on the availability of legislative institutions in the colonies or the hope of having them, as well as the existence of a significant number of western-educated Africans who could make appropriate use of such institutions and organs of expression. Also, the approach of the western-educated African nationalists pre› supposed the acceptance of Western European models of political develop› ment such as nationalists without their experience could not appreciate. Uneven spread of education was, therefore, an important variable in the expression of African nationalism and anti-colonial politics. As European powers concentrated on making colonies pay for their administration and services, relatively little was done to spread western education and provide infrastructure for political and social development.

As one of the editorials observed: 'The introduction of the British system of government in place of the one existing before was an encroachment which no self-respecting nation would allow'.\nIn spite of all the objection to 'alien rule', however, there was never any mention of severing relations with the colonial power; alien rule was bad but there were good reasons for consenting to it; it was better to demand more opportunities for a particular social group and make moderate demands than to do away with alien rule completely; and one could still be 'free', 'under the Union Jack'.

Moreover, as members of a nascent colonial bourgeoisie, they had very different class interests which often placed them at odds with their less privileged counterparts and precluded a more radical critique of colonial-capitalism. Intense rivalries between mulatto and African segments of the colonial elite further reduced the influence of Gremio Africano and helped precipitate its demise. 109 By the early 1930s these animosities had grown progressively worse providing the colonial regime with an opportunity to shatter the last vestiges of unity. Appealing to the discontent of the African membership, state officials convinced several of them to break away and organize the Institutio Negrophilio in 1932. As an additional incentive, the colonial administration provided office space, furniture, books and generous funding while a prominent Portuguese businessman, Paulo Gil dos Santos, offered several leaders of the new organization employment as labour recruiters. Four years later the Salazar regime imposed extremely stringent censorship laws which effectively silenced O Brado Africano.\nDuring this period a small number of Mozambican intellectuals, living in Portugal, helped to form organizations which were linked to the larger pan-African movement. The most important were the Liga Africana and the Partido Nacional Africano. Liga Africana maintained close ties with W. E. B. Du Bois' Pan-African Congress, while the latter expressed greater sympathy for Garveyism. Neither, however, had any substantial following in the colony and their actions were largely symbolic.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey.

However, like the activities in British West Africa, those in French West Africa had their local as well as their international aspects. Indeed, as I have shown elsewhere,$^{23}$ a good deal of Francophone African political activity took place in Paris between 1924 and 1936.

Interesting as these movements were, however, they did not operate in West Africa, although as will be seen later, some of their anti-colonial publications as well as those of their leftwing allies in France, did find their way into some of the French West African colonies.

As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

These conflicts greatly weakened the nationalist movement in that country. Similarly, it was largely because of the internal dissensions and personality conflicts in the Lagos branch of the NCBWA and the opposition of Sir Kitoyi Ajasa's Nigerian Pioneer and the Lagos conservatives that the fourth session of the NCBWA could not take place in Lagos until 1930. Fourthly, it would appear that the limited elective representation granted between 1923 and 1925 had the effect of politically anaesthetizing the nationalist movements.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either.

The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': 'Literary culture in the Western Sudan', 'content': ""largely around the Ivory Coast in 1920, revealed manuscripts which covered history, language (Arabic grammar), poetry, mathematics, logic, jurisprudence, etc. 35 The existence of a literary culture, even of a tiny educated elite at the pyramidal tip of a non-literary mass has enormous consequences not merely for the majority group but for the alien culture from whose canons the literary equipment of that cone is derived.

If we had needed in our mind any further confirmation of the propriety of what we did in inserting that letter, or of the justice and necessity of what we wrote in the article in question, we should have found them abundantly in this letter. We have but too often reason to complain of being furnished by West African correspondents with information of actions and events that must necessarily have a sequence or result, which ought to be equally made known to us, but of which we never hear a word. Our correspondents write on the spur of the moment, and forget that they thereby contract with us an obligation on their part to complete in due time their information. Happily, however, this has not been the course pursued by our informant of Fernando Po, whose letter we published in our March number. This was followed in due time by another from him, which we inserted in our last (June) number, and which gave us the sequel of the slave-murder charge. We commented also on this letter in our last, and earnestly request of our readers that they will read our said comments again, in the light now thrown upon the matter by our new correspondent, Mr. W. W. Jackson. Mr. Jackson, after expressing some of that ""virtuous indignation"" to which we last month alluded, both at our correspondent\'s letter (which we beg leave to inform him was not an anonymous one, or it would not have found a place in our columns) and at our comments, proceeds to say, ""Now that the trial is over, you will perhaps be good enough to allow me to state the plain unvarnished facts, which are these: Mrs. Gardiner—who, by the way, is a native—had a black servant-girl, aged about twelve years, and, as any one knows who has had experience upon the Coast, the blacks require firm treatment and occasional chastisement to keep them in their places. Mrs. Gardiner corrected (!) her servant one day, and the girl afterwards expired. The medical examination, such as it was, went to prove that the girl—who, though young, bore a very bad character—was suffering from several diseases, and these were the cause of death, although the proper punishment (!) administered by Mrs. Gardiner hastened the girl\'s decease."" The comments that we should make on this very precious statement are so obvious that we deem it unnecessary to record them, further than that, knowing what we do of the West Coast, they completely establish the truth of the statement we published in March. ""Mrs. Gardiner corrected her servant one day, and the girl afterwards expired."" ""Diseases were the cause of death, but they were hastened by the proper punishment administered by Mrs. Gardiner."" Here we have the old slaveholder\'s vindication of atrocities committed on the bodies of slaves, with which, in days happily gone by, we were, alas! but too painfully familiar. We were never advocates of the lex talionis, but if we could be tempted to approve of it, it would be in such a case as this of Mrs. Gardiner and her ""servant-girl."" Our impugned correspondent showed us what that ""proper punishment"" inflicted by Mrs. Gardiner really was; and if it shocked any one, which we hope and believe it did, by its horrid brutality, the fault was not that of our correspondent, but that of Mrs. Gardiner, whose sensitive feelings we can happily, have no fear of wounding, supported as she is by the love and admiration of her Fernando Po compeers, European and native, including Mr. Jackson; for this, it appears, is Mrs. Gardiner\'s present status there. We will give Mr. Jackson\'s own words: ""These are the facts, and they are vastly similar to many cases of the kind at home."" We did not know this, and regret that Mr. Jackson has not given us a few instances, especially as combined with the sequence stated in the following words: ""Mrs. Gardiner is still living here, and, instead of being execrated, as one would imagine from your correspondent\'s letter she would be, is respected and sympathized with as before;"" and to this he adds: ""The attempt to mislead yourselves, and to create a fearful impression at home regarding our social life here, cannot be too strongly reprobated."" Does not the view of Fernando Po society which this opens to us fully justify our last month\'s leader, in which we referred to the outcry against us there? Mr. Jackson has confirmed, in his peculiar way, all that our correspondent had written to us; and we have not one word to unsay as to the state of demoralization that prevails among the small knots of European traders that carry on their mercantile operations in obscure parts of the West Coast, such as Fernando Po for example. And now we would remind Mr. Jackson that there is something else that ""cannot be too strongly reprobated,"" and that is the studied endeavour to mislead us by an ex parte statement, that conceals the most important facts of the case. It was most likely thought at Fernando Po that the ""virtuous indignation"" expressed there at our correspondent for having written to us, and at our comments, would have sufficed to prevent any further communication being made to us about the trial. Mr. Jackson, therefore, has so written that, had we not been better informed, we might have inferred from his letter that Mrs. Gardiner had been absolved in the judicial inquiry, and was, therefore, an object of respect and sympathy. He does not, therefore, say one word of the condemnation, the exile, the new Governor, the new King, the amnesty which embraced her as well as other criminals, and the return to Fernando Po. Our first correspondent, whom he censures, must therefore be regarded as far more trustworthy than himself, as he certainly is far more deserving of honour in sympathizing with the poor dead victim than with the living aggressor. We are inclined to believe that Mr. Jackson must be a very young man, or we should not have heard of him in this matter. Warm as the indignation against us has been in Fernando Po, we fancy there must have been something more than this to induce him to thrust his paw, or allow his paw to be thrust into this fire, that he might pull out the Gardiners\' chestnuts. He is certainly entitled to Mr. Gardiner\'s generosity and to Mrs. Gardiner\'s smiles, since it is not his fault if he has failed in the hazardous attempt. If we possessed the power attributed to some of the wonderful magicians whose feats are recorded in the veracious stories of ""The Thousand and One Nights,"" we should certainly exercise it by metamorphosing him into a little servant or slave girl to Mrs. Gardiner, when we should have but little fear of his meeting his just reward, and arriving at a full appreciation of the characters of those who respect her and sympathize with her for having, by carrying her ""proper punishment"" too far, deprived herself of all future pleasure in torturing her helpless victim. Our sympathy—wretch, no doubt, that we are!—is with the dead slave, and not with the living mistress. In one thing, however, we do rejoice, and we have to thank Mr. Jackson for our joy. Mrs. Gardiner is not an European, but a native. We are sorry the same thing cannot be said of Mr. Gardiner, who, if he has any legitimate power over Mrs. Gardiner, ought to have prevented her from thus atrociously chastising her defenceless slave-girl.

The solicitor then winked to the Judge, who thereupon said, \'Court adjourned for half an hour!\' The jurors then marched respectively in pairs to partake of refreshments, with sparkling moselle, &c., prepared for them by the said solicitor. On the reappearance of all parties in Court, after a few words of badinage by the solicitor, there were also a few from the Judge, concluding with, \'But I do not mean that you should find these parties guilty!\' and the jury obediently acquitted them.""

But if we could publish the whole case, it would be seen in a moment that they were wrong, and that this was well known to those who induced the jury to return such a verdict.

When we copied from the Monrovia Observer, and published in our September number, with some editorial comments, the statement of the alleged throwing overboard of Kroomen from the mail steamer Biafra, we prefaced the one with the question, ""Can this be true?"" and stated in the other our willingness to publish any contradiction by the officers of the steamer or the Company to which the steamer belongs. We should not have copied the statement into our paper, but that it stated, ""the men were landed at Monrovia, many of them entirely naked."" Now, Monrovia is not a very large place, and as it had long seemed to us that the Monrovia Observer was most respectably and carefully conducted, we naturally supposed that the Editor had satisfied himself of the truth of the very serious allegations. In this it appears that we were altogether in error, and were thus innocently led into inflicting pain upon the Captain of the steamer. Those who know us personally would understand how deeply this would grieve us. Instead, however, of availing himself of the offer contained in our leader, Captain Rattray placed the matter in the hands of his Attorney in Liverpool, and we received a letter from them, threatening us with proceedings for libel, and our Printer also, unless we published in our next number a refutation of the charge, with our apologies for its insertion and for our comments. We replied immediately, that nothing could have given us greater pleasure than the assurance that the alleged circumstance never occurred, and that we were ready to publish any letter of Captain Rattray to this effect, supplementing it with expression of our most sincere and heartfelt regret that we should have given publicity to so false a statement. We received a reply that this was unsatisfactory, and that unless we agreed fully to their demands to publish whatever they might send to us in contradiction, with the most ample apology, and agreed to pay all costs, proceedings would be commenced immediately. We were not in London on the Saturday to receive this, and our Printer wrote them to this effect, but when we found it on the Monday we reiterated by post our willingness to do all that could be reasonably required to atone for our unintentional offence. But a writ had been already issued on that Monday, and we were served with it on Tuesday, just after we had written what we intended to insert, with the purpose of sending it by that day\'s post. But on receiving the writ, we placed the matter in the hands of our Solicitors, Messrs. Hollams, Son, and Coward, to effect a settlement, when what appears in another column was agreed upon and accepted as satisfactory, on our payment of costs. In making this statement of facts to show our African readers the perils to which we are exposed in our labours for Africa, we again repeat our deep and sincere regret for any pain we may have caused Captain Rattray by the reproduction of the falsehood in our columns, while, at the same time, stating that we should have done this without any legal proceedings on his part, which have thus inflicted on us a heavy and unnecessary expense. We cannot, however, acquit the Editor of the Monrovia Observer of blame in this matter, and we think he owes us an apology as full and sincere as that which we have given to Captain Rattray, and which, we repeat, we should have given upon a simple statement and demand had such been made direct to us by him.'}]","[{'document_title': 'The Complaints from Old Calabar', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The War on the Gold Coast, from the period of the crossing of the Prah by the invading Ashantees twenty months ago, and the Parliamentary and other public and official proceedings connected with it, and with the establishment of the new Gold Coast Colony, with coast extension over the old coast line purchased by Great Britain in time past from Denmark, have so occupied our columns, that we could not find time or space for a number of complaints of wrongs endured, and evil deeds committed in Native and British territories on the West Coast.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F.

With this preface, we call attention to those letters above referred to, and to other statements of similar character from other places that may appear now and from time to time in our columns. Both these Old Calabar complaints, which are not made to us now for the first time, are very serious ones—one of them in a moral and religious, and the other in a social point of view. We know that there is no portion of the self-imposed duties of our Missionary Societies to which they attach more importance, than the selection of fit and proper persons to carry on the great and inexpressibly important work of Evangelization among the heathen. When, therefore, complaints reach us of misconduct on the part of any of these messengers of the Gospel of truth and light, and purity and peace, we are by no means ready or willing to receive or credit them. We are but too willing to believe that there may be personal spite or exaggeration, or, at the worst, possibly some momentary lapse, which—however much to be regretted and deplored, because of the evil repute it may bring upon the holy work with which they are connected, and the hindrance it may place in the way of reception of those good tidings they are commissioned to proclaim—all human instruments are, unhappily, liable to. It is only when, as in this case of Old Calabar, we find reiterated statements of persistence in evil that, as now, we reluctantly decide to give them partial publicity. We had rather confine ourselves to the transmission of the statements to head-quarters—a course which we have in this present case pursued simultaneously with this publication—giving the transmitted statement full and complete, as we have received it, that those whose duty it is may institute without delay the necessary inquiries; if they find the statements to be well founded, may apply the proper remedy, and if they find the charges unjust, may vindicate in our columns (which are always open for such a purpose) the character and conduct that have been impugned. The other complaints, which refer to the conduct of agents, supercargoes, and European clerks of the great British firms trading with the River in question, and who have hulks stationed there for the carrying on of their trade—and which we have said are important in a social point of view—are more difficult to deal with in every way. We know by long experience that it is utterly useless to forward such complaints, with the charges they directly or indirectly contain, to the merchant employers of those agents, supercargoes, and clerks. These persons are sent out to the West Coast by their employers to make money—so to perform the duties with which they are charged, that they may be profitable to their employers. Whether they are or not, is a question with which we have not any concern. The charges to which we give publicity are to the effect, that they use undue, oppressive, and what we should characterize as almost criminal means, for preserving to themselves and their principals a monopoly of the trade. It has long been widely known that they are not over-scrupulous, on the score of justice and humanity, in the means which they employ with this object, and in frustrating as far as possible every effort of Sierra Leone traders to purchase oil and ship it to England. But our Sierra Leone friends should bear in mind that these people have organized the trade there, at great expense and risk, at a time when there were not any West Coast native traders in a position to make even the slightest effort to do this; and that they cannot be expected to relinquish what they have thus organized, so long as it can be carried on profitably by them, without a struggle. That struggle, however, must be restrained within such limits, that it shall not infringe the rights of other British subjects to carry on their trade without let or hindrance. The great merchants represented by these European agents, supercargoes, and clerks, could not carry on their business there, without leaning on the protection and influence of Her Majesty's Government; which has always been ready to insist with the native kings and chiefs on the redress of any wrong done to them and their trade; and it will certainly be one of our objects to make that protection and influence efficacious for West African native traders, as it is for them—and even to procure that the same power and influence shall be used against them, for this purpose, if necessary, through their overstepping those limits within which trade struggles everywhere should be restrained. The advantage they have over all others by their stocks of goods ready for barter, their power of giving credit, and their hulks ready to receive oil to be trans-shipped for England by steamer or otherwise, ought in themselves to be sufficient to secure for them all that they can be in any way entitled to, without their resorting to unjustifiable and oppressive measures against their weak opponents, who may be striving to obtain a livelihood. Our complainants, however, go further than the mere complaint about wrongs done to them. They carry the war into the enemy's quarters by insinuating that they are dishonest in their dealings with their employers in England—unworthy of the confidence of their employers; and that the latter would obtain much better results in their operations if they would engage these West Coast educated natives, principally from Sierra Leone, as their clerks and agents. We have nothing to do with the first portion of this insinuation; the question there is entirely between the European agents, supercargoes, and clerks, and their employers; who, no doubt, believe they have good grounds for regarding them as faithful and dependable. But with respect to the latter insinuation or recommendation, that Sierra Leoneans should be employed instead; and that their employment would give the merchants much better results, we are sorry, indeed, to feel compelled to say that we are not able at present to endorse it. That such ought to be the case, is incontrovertible, but there must be a great change before we could feel a conviction that such would be the case. With sorrow and shame, we feel constrained to admit that, as a general rule, they have not established a reputation such as would encourage a feeling of confidence and trust in them. There are men among them who shed a lustre on their race for commercial probity, and the possession of those qualities which elevate a trading community; but these are the exceptions, not the rule. Had it not been so, there would at this time be few, if any, Europeans employed on the West Coast. The Sierra Leoneans have so great an advantage over them for service there, that all that is wanting among European merchants is confidence in them, to lead to their almost exclusive employment. Greatly, indeed, do we desire that they may speedily inspire that confidence; but until they do we cannot hope to see them in the chief positions of trust on the West Coast. We may, in a future article, enter into the question of what has led to the feelings of distrust in them which now so much prevail; and the degree in which these feelings are just or unjust. Justified though they may be in many respects by facts, we do not hesitate to state that they are not entirely so; and that the subordinate West African, has been but too often made the scape-goat for European delinquents."", 'last_edit_date': '1874-09-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_09_1874#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Obstacles to Progress in Liberia', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. W.

We often find him travelling along the beach at ten o'clock at night for a boat to go on board the shipping to get himself drunk, and when he returns the next morning there must be two Krooboys beside him—one on his right hand and another on his left—to carry him home.

He called himself a doctor, too; but if any of us go to him for medicine, he refuses to give us any, and, at the same time, he objects to other doctors attending us. This he did to two of us; he refused to let Dr. Spearce attend two of our boys, and through this they are dead. Who can look upon such a man and call him a man of God? He only came out to deceive the Home Board and to get pay—150l. a-year. We had sooner not have a church than to have him with us.

In contrast, The African Times articles provide concrete examples of collaborative efforts between local and European scholars, such as the publication of ""Folk Tales of Angola"" by Heli Chatelain, which includes translations and explanatory notes, and the ""History of the Gold Coast and Asante"" by Rev. C. C. Reindorf, a native pastor.

She insisted that Chiarini should make her mirrors, and that Cecchi should manufacture her guns. In vain did the two unfortunates plead that they could not, that they lacked the requisite instruments. The Queen persisted in her demands, cutting short, as they failed to satisfy them, the travellers\' allowance of food. At last Chiarini, by means of a little tin, some mercury taken from a scientific instrument, and a fragment of glass, managed to turn out something distantly resembling a mirror, with which her Majesty was greatly delighted.

C. C. Reindorf, a Native pastor attached to the Basel Mission at Christiansborg. This book consists of some 380 pp. and contains an interesting historical account, during the last four centuries, of the Ashanti and other Native races within the present Gold Coast ""sphere of influence""—that is, ever since the re-discovery of the western coast of Africa by the famous Portuguese navigators in the latter part of the fifteenth century. The author himself, he tells us, a descendant ""of the national officiating high priests in Akra and Christiansborg,"" has been at great pains to gather together and set in order the traditions of his race; and though he is anxious to guard his readers against expecting too much from him, yet in spite of all the great difficulties which he must have had to contend with in obtaining and arranging information of the character which he required, he has certainly succeeded in compiling a most interesting historical account of a race and a country about which Englishmen, in common with all Europeans, are generally only too ignorant. Naturally the author has a good deal to say about the Basle Mission, with which he is so intimately connected; but all descriptions of Christian Missionary enterprise receive from him full credit for what they have accomplished, and for their several attempts at ameliorating the condition of his fatherland. We would direct special attention to the author\'s preface, which is followed by some equally pertinent remarks by his friend the Rev. J. C. Christaller, to whom was entrusted the task of seeing the work through the press. Indeed of the whole book we feel we cannot speak too highly, and the views the author takes are sound and well stated. Take the following: ""The slave trade was commenced in 1517, and the general abolition and emancipation took place in 1874. It was a disease which had been imported by Europeans, and which had affected the whole country during a period of 357 years. Providentially the curse was removed by the English Government, but left the country without a substitute. If our English Government would encourage and assist the introduction of railways into the country, the vast amount of money sustained as a loss by the emancipation, could be compensated. Labour and living would be cheap, trade would flourish, the country would improve rapidly, and the revenue would increase."" Of necessity, much space is devoted to a history of the Dutch, the Danish, and the British occupations of the coast, and a tabular list of the Governors of these three nationalities is given in the form of an Appendix; to which are further added tables showing the kings and chief members of the Royal Family of Ashanti from 1600 to the present day, and other statistical information.

I say to my master, Would you like to be black man? He says, No. I say, Alambdu good boy. My master says, Alambdu good boy. Mattusi (Matteucci) good white man; Massari good white man. The man Mattusi had plenty money. I have fled into the mountain. He has said to me, Will you come? I have said, Will you give me to eat? Who eats not dies. The man Mattusi has said, Yes; I am gone with Abu-ras, black boy; with Rama, black boy.* Mattusi dead. My master says, Didn\'t thou cry? I say, No, because I did not see him when dead. He says, When I shall die, wilt thou cry? I say, Yes, because I shall see thee. Rama is more black than I; I am more black than Abu-ras. Abu-ras has bitten my arm, Rama no. Rama is more good than Abu-ras. I say to my master, Take me to Rama; I want to see him because he is good and little. I have cried when I have left Rama and Abu-ras. My master says, Aburas and Rama greet thee. I shall see Rama. I have seen the sea. Big sea. Madira, Lundra, Livipul, Guenna, Liburnu, Napli—all sea. Sea pfùn, pfùn, pfùn, big.

Inkilisi men, Ké, Ké, Ké, Ké. I have said, Men, what do you say? The white men said, Ddu spikinklish? Inkilisi men eat plenty; Inkilisi fat. They said, Drink arak. My master says, Arak not good, Inkilisi bad. Arak ppò, ppà, ppùp. Inkilisi men said, Smok topako. Smoke not good, Kurukurukuah. My master said, Topako not good for little men. Alambdu is little. The houses of the white men touch the clouds. To go in, dindili, dindili, dindili. The white men sleep on clothes bed and eat on a hard bed. All white; white good. When the sun goes down in the big sea my master makes me light the water that burns. I say, what is called this water? He says, This water is called petrolo. I say, Who has lighted the big fire on the mountain?† My master says, That is the fire of the earth. My master has said, Dress thyself and come. I have gone. Plenty horses, little dogs. Dar-For few horses, big dogs, plenty sheep, plenty nimir (leopards). Nimir not good mvua, mvua, mvua. They have followed me; I have escaped into the big tree. I have said to my master: What do those big points point to? He has said: Those are the fires of the evening. *Eua?* Plenty horses, plenty fires, plenty men. I have said: Where is the Sultan of the white men? My master has said: At the end, in the red house.|| My master has given me sweet bread and the water with pricks. I have said: Does not this water make die? He has said: No; *acqua firata* (*acqua ferrata*, iron water) good. My master has said: Dress thyself in the dress of Dar-For, and come. I have said: No, I don\'t like; the white men look at me and say I am ugly. He has said: Thou art a bad boy; the white men look at thee because thou art pretty. I have said: Give me the white veil for the *tarboosh*, and then I shall be a pretty boy. He has said yes. We have been in a big low house.§ I have said, These men write the Koran. My master has said, No, these men write the facts of the world. Facts of the world, Italian, *ghiornale* (*giornale*, journals). Dar-For *ghiornale*, no. I have said, Where is the Sultan of these men? My master has said, Salute Mr. Kafiero. *Ponghiorno signore.* The man Kafiero has lit the fire-air. Ppà, beautiful! In the big low house there was a vapùr. I have said, Does this house go? My master has said, No, Vapùr ghiornale, tarata, tarata, quick. The men have made me write. I have said, This is not *ghiornale*, this is the Koran. We have been in a big, low house, ¶ beautiful house. All the men were eating. Chittic, chittic, tic, srrrr. Plenty fire, big glass. I have said, Where is the Sultan? My master has said, The Sultan is not here. I have not eaten. I have not drunk the good water. The man that ran about with a black dress has given me a little plate. I have said, Master, this is white soap. He has said, Eat, it does not make die. Cold good. I have eaten the cold (ice). We have been in a big, big house, with many fires and many doors.** Many men below, white heads without hair. I have said, Is this the house of the Sultan? My master has said, No; it is made like the house of the Sultan, but it is not it. I have put my hand on the red skin eaten by little worms (plush)! My master has said: Look; the big door†† has risen up, and I have seen the house of the Sultan.‡‡ I have seen the big sea and palm-trees. Bare white women, tiri tiri. Big fantasia.

As Karl Vogt says, ""Our civilisation came not from Asia, but from Africa, and Heer has proved that the cultivated plants in the Swiss lake-villages are of African, and, to a great extent, of Egyptian origin."" According to Logan, the pre-Aryan civilisation of Southern India had a partially Egyptian character. The oldest races, he asserts, were of a variable African type which spoke languages allied to the African. Egypt, and not India, is the common cradle of all we have in common, east, west, north, and south, all round the world. The languages, beliefs, rites, laws and customs went out to India, but did not return thence by means of the apocryphal Aryan migrations. The Indian affinity with our European folk-lore and fairyology is neither first nor final, \'tis but the affinity of a collateral relationship. Egypt supplied the parent source, the inventive mind, the propagating migratory power. In Egypt alone we shall find the roots of the vast tree, whose boughs and branches have extended to a worldwide reach.""\n\nA critic observes, ""The author makes Africa the birth-place of us all. In the far off past a Central African race got on to the Nile in its upper course, and gradually descended towards the Delta, halting in Æthiopia, but finding it impossible to stop on account of the pressure of population behind. Thus the Central Africans became Æthiopians, and the Æthiopians became Egyptians ... all the ends of the earth became peopled from Africa!!!""

It is indeed a compendium. It places before us in brief but luminous sketches, and with the aid of sixteen admirable maps and some seventy illustrations, all that is publicly known about Africa and its peoples—their specific peculiarities, character, manners, customs, and condition, physical and moral; with enumeration of its varied products, its trade and commerce. It is an admirable volume for all who desire general information respecting that great continent, into the dense darkness of which the light of civilization and Christianity has begun to penetrate, through the devoted exertions of missionaries and scientific explorers. Africa does not present us with any very pleasing pictures. They are all of barbarism, and for the most part barbarism of the lowest and most disgusting type, and yet such as awakes and impels to active exertion the warmest sympathies and desires of the Christian and philanthropist. Such books as this of Mr. Stanford\'s are particularly valuable in view of the extremely limited degree of information respecting Africa possessed even by the majority of well-educated people in England. So many active agencies are now at work in and for Africa that some more intimate knowledge of it must be desired; while yet the labour of wading through long and dreary books of African travel, with their sadly monotonous succession of pictures of sparsely-inhabited countries, and of ignorance, suffering, cruelty, and moral degradation everywhere, deters most people from seeking it in their pages. This ""Compendium"" meets such desires, and gets rid of such difficulties, offering as a prize to be gained by a few leisure hours\' reading all that it is essential well-educated people should know of this great continent. The degree of knowledge thus to be obtained may lead some whose attention has not hitherto been called in that direction to desires and sympathies with regard to that long-neglected quarter of the world, and its wretched populations. We therefore hail its appearance with great pleasure, and strongly recommend ""Stanford\'s Compendium—Africa"" to our readers. The educated Africans of the West Coast ought all to possess it, as in it they will see what Africa really is throughout, and the opinions current respecting it and themselves. Some of these opinions are not at all flattering, and wherever our friends can show them to be unjust we shall be glad to help in correcting them through our columns.', 'last_edit_date': '1878-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1878#article-24', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.595, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Languages of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The volumes lately published by Mr. Robert N.

In the present state of knowledge, Mr. Cust summarizes the following table:—\n\n| Family or Group       | Branches | Languages | Dialects |\n|-----------------------|----------|-----------|----------|\n| 1.

Under that test there will prevail the law of the ""survival of the fittest."" Of the great number, as many as sixty-six have received the Bible in part or in whole. The importance to the welfare of any language of a translation of the Bible is well expressed by the author: ""Experience on the West Coast of Africa and the story of the English Bible and of Luther\'s Bible warn us that when the language of a country is still in flux it will settle down and gravitate around the translation of the Scriptures. I do not find that any language has ever perished from the great reservoir of human knowledge which has been elevated to the dignity of being the vehicle of divine knowledge."" The following races have the whole Bible: Arabic, Amharic, Koptic, Ashantee, Akra or Ga, Yaraba or Yoruba, Efik, Xosa or Kafir, Sesuto, Sechuana. Some have the entire New Testament, as the Herrero, the language which serves the Rhenish Society, north of Bushman-land. Others have as yet only smaller portions. Probably no other African language attracts more attention now than the Swahili, of which the missionary Krapf left an elaborate dictionary, and of which Mr. Cust expresses the opinion that it ""is, and is destined to continue, one of the twelve most important languages of the world, with reference to the vast area over which it is the lingua franca.""—Foreign Missionary.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1887#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.614, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""AN AFRICAN'S CONTRIBUTION"", 'section_title': '', 'content': ""### AN AFRICAN'S CONTRIBUTION."", 'last_edit_date': '1881-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1881#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.607, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Native Character in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We extract the following interesting letter from the American **Spirit of Missions**, as it gives a good insight into native character and prejudices:—', 'last_edit_date': '1881-12-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.613, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Tribute to African Times', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'From a distinguished Christian labourer in Africa: ""From a twenty years\' African experience, I know some of the difficulties that beset your path in advocating the interests of Africa, and in seeking to promote the amelioration of her millions of inhabitants; but your path is that of truth and justice, which has prevailed, and will prevail, in doing good at home and abroad; therefore, take courage, and go on in the good work.""', 'last_edit_date': '1864-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1864#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.611, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICAN MISSIONARIES, THEIR CONVERTS AND THE ANTHROPOLOGISTS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'On the banks of this river lived Ediker, a chief.

Since these remarkable people—probably the origin of the stories of pigmies told by the Greek poets—were discovered in the Monbutto country, to the west of the Albert Nyanza, by the German traveller, Schweinfurth, in 1870, they have received considerable attention from various anthropologists, and descriptions and measurements of several living individuals have been published; but hitherto no account of their anatomical character has been given. The skeletons obtained by Emin Pasha are the first that have been sent to Europe, and are, therefore, of great interest, especially as they fully confirm all that has been said of the diminutive size of these people, and prove them to be the smallest on the earth, smaller even than the natives of the Andaman Islands or the Bushmen of South Africa. These two skeletons, though both of fully-grown people, are scarcely four English feet high, and a woman of the race, carefully measured by Emin Pasha, was still shorter. They are well formed, and present most of the characteristics of the negro race, except that the skull is rather rounder in shape than is usual. With respect to this character, it has been long ago pointed out by the French anthropologist, Hamy, that in Equatorial Africa, extending from the West Coast far into the interior, are scattered tribes interspersed among the more ordinary negro population, and distinguished from them by this form of head and by their diminutive stature. They appear to constitute a distinct branch of the great negro race to which the name of ""Negrillo"" has been applied, and seem to bear the same relationship to their better-grown neighbours as the small ""Negritos"" of the Indian Archipelago do to the larger Melanesians or oceanic negros of the same regions. It is to this Negrillo race that the Akkas, whose characteristics have for the first time been described, belong.

If the rites and ceremonies of the religion of the tribes bordering on the banks of the River Niger be closely examined and compared with the religion of the Hebrews at the earliest period—viz., Egbo Ebo (Heber, Eber) tribe; if the Egbo (Heber Eber) language, with all its corruption, be compared with that of the Hebrews; and if the peculiar disposition of the Hebrew tribes, as detailed in Scripture, and that of the Egboes be properly investigated—there will be found by the philosophic mind sufficient a priori reasons for a serious inquiry whether the Egbo tribe, which is but a branch of the Gala tribe in the interior, is the offspring of the lost tribes of Israel, driven down from central Africa, and forced to cross the Eastern or Quorra branch of the Niger by Mohammedan fanaticism."", 'last_edit_date': '1865-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.599, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

But so long as demijohn follows demijohn of rum ... no reinforcements of missionaries and no homilies from professional philanthropists, on the blessing of European civilization will avail anything. 43 An ardent campaigner for Africa-oriented educational reforms, Grant, deeply influenced by Blyden, sought an educational system which had the university at its apex but only as an institution which was designed to provide research and teaching in fields related to Africa, as opposed to the 'conventional literary education which emphasized European culture and values'.

In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Conclusion', 'content': ""By the first decade of the twentieth century there were practically no indigenous sovereign states in Southern Africa.

The slave trade had intensified internecine warfare for over two centuries, leading to cultural devastation on an unprecedented scale. Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent. Different methods of foreign control or interaction with the African populace naturally evoked or created different cultural responses from the displaced African.

In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes.

The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ...

These are the sources for the study of, and the periodization for, the history of colonialism in Africa. As far as sources are concerned, the authors and research students enjoy some advantages as well as disadvantages over those of the other volumes. To take the latter first, this volume and Volume VIII cover periods in which, unlike those of the other volumes, part of the archival materials is still inaccessible to scholars. Indeed, some archival material in several metropolitan countries such as that in France for the period up to 1930 was opened to scholars only after some of these chapters had already been completed. Moreover, with the partition and the entry of so many different European powers into Africa, the problem of language that faces research students becomes a difficult one.\nTo compensate for this, more journals and periodicals become available and published parliamentary papers, debates, commissions of inquiries, papers of private companies and associations, and published annual reports become more numerous than in the periods before; all of these are available. Above all, some of the actors in the colonial drama themselves are still alive and can be and have been interviewed. Others, both African and European, have also begun to publish their memoirs and autobiographies or to recall them in novels, plays and learned treatises. In all these respects, the authors of this volume enjoy some advantages over most of the authors of the other volumes.\nFinally, it appears far more research has been and is still being done on the subject of colonialism and far more has been published and is still being published on it than on any other theme in African history. Indeed, within the last ten years, a five-volume history of colonialism in Africa edited by L. H. Gann and Peter Duignan and published by the Cambridge University Press has appeared.

The neglect of higher education and technical training also compelled some Africans who could afford to do so, to send their children to the metropolitan countries as well as to the United States, and it was such people who, partly from their varying experiences of racial discrimination and, even more important still, their deeper appreciation of the evil nature of the colonial system, became on their return, as will be shown in the next volume, the most bitter critics of the system and the leaders of the anti-colonial or nationalist movements.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Infrastructure', 'content': ""One of the most important aspects of marketing is infrastructure. The construction of railways, roads, telegraph lines and harbours received the attention of the colonial administrations quite early on. Though these facilities helped in the general administration, their main task was to evacuate exports. No wonder therefore that the location and general direc› tion of railways and roads took little account of the general welfare of the dependencies. Most railways ran directly from the coast to interior sources of cash crops or mineral deposits. Only a few lateral and inter-colonial links were established. Railways therefore served only limited areas, and, important as they have been, their role in 'opening up' the continent has certainly been exaggerated.$^{86}$ Only in Southern Rhodesia and South Africa were there more sophisticated railway networks, mainly intended to connect and serve the widely-scattered mining areas and settler farming regions. The cocoa belt of the southern Gold Coast, too, was well served by railways, while the Northern Territories with no export crops, were completely ignored. (See Figs 16.2, 16.3.)\nMost of the railways were constructed, owned, and operated by govern› ments or official agencies. Construction of the first railway in British West Africa took place in Sierra Leone during the 1890s. The first train started operating in the colony area in 1897, and by 1909 the main line, crossing the rich palm oil belt to Pendembu, in the east (365 km) had been completed. A branch line from Bubuyan to Makeni in the north (132 km) was opened in 1915. Soon after the work started in Sierra Leone, other dependencies followed her example with even better results. All major lines were built by 1920. In Tanganyika the British inherited the two railways constructed by the Germans earlier during the twentieth century."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.631, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 415, 'article_title': 'RIVER GAMBIA', 'full_section_title': 'RIVER GAMBIA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1864#article-1', 'issue_date': '23_08_1864', 'content': ""We beg leave to congratulate our Gambia friends upon the success of another of our efforts in their behalf. We are officially informed, that, acting on our suggestion, measures are in course of preparation for giving to the Gambia settlement the benefit of postage stamps.\n\nWe are sorry to have great complaints of the non-receipt, by our Gambia subscribers, of their newspapers. It is rarely that we have now a complaint from any other quarter; but the irregularity, or something worse, still prevails at the Gambia. We alluded in our last to the continuance, in the Bathurst Post-office, of some of the abuses which we had hoped would have disappeared with the change of management. We repeat our hope that the notice we have again taken of these things will lead to an efficient remedy being adopted.\n\nIt has given us very great pleasure to receive the disclaimer of our Bathurst friends, that they have been ever moved by any personal motives in the complaint they have made to us, or have ever written what is not strictly true. We want, as we have before said, to be able to depend entirely on the perfect truthfulness of our correspondents everywhere in Africa. The cause of truth cannot be served by falsehood, and ours is the cause of truth, and of Africa. It appears that the garrison schoolmaster, by his communication inserted in our June number, had no reason or excuse for imputing inaccuracy to our correspondents in the matter of the first Colonial Writer. We are sorry to have to have to mention this gentleman again, but he has only his friend the garrison schoolmaster to thank for it; and we think after the specimen we have had of the garrison schoolmaster, that the first Writer in the Colonial-office may be fairly congratulated that it is under one of the other black schoolmasters,* and not under the G. S., that he is receiving instruction.\n\nWe rejoice to insert the following; there is nothing we so much desire as to find cause for praise:—\n\nBathurst, July 23.\n\nDear Sir,—We are indeed happy to state that the Acting-Colonial Engineer, Mr. Ingram, jun., is not only active but prompt in the performance of his duties. A good deal is being done to cure the defective arrangement in the drainage to which you so kindly and powerfully called attention in our behalf. Nearly all the streets in the Colony are now very much improved in the drainage; and the main drain of which especial complaint was made in your number of September, 1863, has been raised twelve inches above the former level; and a suitable brick bridge has been erected at the proper place. Surely we have cause to rejoice, while attributing all the praise to the African-Aid Society and to its valuable journal, the African Times.—Yours, &c.,\n\nThe Gambians.\n\nWe look to our Gambia friends to make a good show at the Sierra Leone Industrial Exhibition.

(all in dollars and half-dollars), for Señor Manoel J. St. Anna, of Lagos. On Feb. 23, he sent his clerk, named William Hart (son of a Bonny chief), to go out in his bar boat for the money. He went, accompanied by a bricklayer, named Vash Longmore, from Sierra Leone; and after receiving the keg containing the cash, they ordered the Krooboys to pull the boat alongside the mail S.S. Elmina, which was then in port on her way to England. They went on board that steamer with the keg of money, and ordered the Krooboys away. They came and told their master. Meanwhile the Elmina sailed away homeward. The merchant at once, at six o'clock p.m. of Feb. 23, applied for a warrant, and got it next morning (Sunday), the 24th. The S.S. King Docemo was engaged, and she went off with Captain Graves, Assistant-Inspector Gold Coast Constabulary, and some constables, and the mail steamer Elmina was overtaken at Little Popo. No sooner did Messrs. Hart and Longmore see the King Docemo in sight than they knew at once that it was for their apprehension. They took to a canoe with the money, and set off for shore. Captain Graves, however, did his business well; and it was complete. Both prisoners were caught with 298l. of the money, and brought away to Lagos. They arrived on the 27th, after four days’ absence. The King Docemo belongs to Walsh Brothers, of Liverpool and Lagos, and was engaged at 30l. per day, so that 120l. has to be paid for her service. The prisoners have been committed to take their trial at the Sessions. Lagos ought to congratulate herself on possessing such facilities, considering she has no telegraph. Lagos has about twelve river steamers, averaging from 60 to about 200 tons (for particulars vide “Payne’s Lagos Almanack”). We hope that, as usual, his Honour Mr. Justice Marshall will inflict a punishment on these thieves which they will never forget, and that others may be deterred from doing the like; and we hope, further, that all employers will see the necessity of paying good wages to honest men when they deserve it. Mr. Hart’s pay was 3l. per month, with not a very good character. Hence, though his service was cheap, yet it was very dear at the end. Out of 515l., Mr. St. Anna will have only about 170l. left to him.""}, {'id': 4517, 'article_title': 'The Alleged Drowning of Kroomen', 'full_section_title': 'The Alleged Drowning of Kroomen', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-14', 'issue_date': '01_11_1882', 'content': 'Our readers will find in another column evidence of the perils which beset journalism even when conducted with the greatest caution and the most earnest desire to do good unmixed with evil. When we copied from the Monrovia Observer, and published in our September number, with some editorial comments, the statement of the alleged throwing overboard of Kroomen from the mail steamer Biafra, we prefaced the one with the question, ""Can this be true?"" and stated in the other our willingness to publish any contradiction by the officers of the steamer or the Company to which the steamer belongs. We should not have copied the statement into our paper, but that it stated, ""the men were landed at Monrovia, many of them entirely naked."" Now, Monrovia is not a very large place, and as it had long seemed to us that the Monrovia Observer was most respectably and carefully conducted, we naturally supposed that the Editor had satisfied himself of the truth of the very serious allegations. In this it appears that we were altogether in error, and were thus innocently led into inflicting pain upon the Captain of the steamer. Those who know us personally would understand how deeply this would grieve us. Instead, however, of availing himself of the offer contained in our leader, Captain Rattray placed the matter in the hands of his Attorney in Liverpool, and we received a letter from them, threatening us with proceedings for libel, and our Printer also, unless we published in our next number a refutation of the charge, with our apologies for its insertion and for our comments. We replied immediately, that nothing could have given us greater pleasure than the assurance that the alleged circumstance never occurred, and that we were ready to publish any letter of Captain Rattray to this effect, supplementing it with expression of our most sincere and heartfelt regret that we should have given publicity to so false a statement. We received a reply that this was unsatisfactory, and that unless we agreed fully to their demands to publish whatever they might send to us in contradiction, with the most ample apology, and agreed to pay all costs, proceedings would be commenced immediately. We were not in London on the Saturday to receive this, and our Printer wrote them to this effect, but when we found it on the Monday we reiterated by post our willingness to do all that could be reasonably required to atone for our unintentional offence. But a writ had been already issued on that Monday, and we were served with it on Tuesday, just after we had written what we intended to insert, with the purpose of sending it by that day\'s post. But on receiving the writ, we placed the matter in the hands of our Solicitors, Messrs. Hollams, Son, and Coward, to effect a settlement, when what appears in another column was agreed upon and accepted as satisfactory, on our payment of costs. In making this statement of facts to show our African readers the perils to which we are exposed in our labours for Africa, we again repeat our deep and sincere regret for any pain we may have caused Captain Rattray by the reproduction of the falsehood in our columns, while, at the same time, stating that we should have done this without any legal proceedings on his part, which have thus inflicted on us a heavy and unnecessary expense. We cannot, however, acquit the Editor of the Monrovia Observer of blame in this matter, and we think he owes us an apology as full and sincere as that which we have given to Captain Rattray, and which, we repeat, we should have given upon a simple statement and demand had such been made direct to us by him.'}, {'id': 5015, 'article_title': 'PORTUGAL AND THE CONGO.', 'full_section_title': 'PORTUGAL AND THE CONGO.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-3', 'issue_date': '02_02_1885', 'content': 'A private telegram has just (Feb. 3) been received, stating that both banks of the River Congo had been seized by Portugal.

In order that our readers may have some idea of the difficulties in the way of journalism where evils and errors are to be exposed with a view to effect a salutary change, we may state briefly what then occurred. We expurgated the chief communication we had received, which was a long report of a criminal case brought before one of the Courts, and incidents in the trial. We did not name the Court, nor the presiding Judge, nor the parties concerned. But it was held by our publishers that there was sufficient to lead to identification; and that, therefore, as “the greater the truth the greater the libel,” they could not take the risk of allowing it to appear in our columns. We had no resource but to bow to the decision, and refrain from publishing it. As it was strongly confirmative of what we had stated in our leader above alluded to, we can scarcely say that we submitted with a good grace. And yet, considering the small amount of support received by us from the West Coast, where comparatively so few of our nominal subscribers think it necessary to pay for the African Times, we can have no doubt they were right in preventing us as well as themselves from incurring any risk of the expense of defending an action for libel. At the same time, we feel it to be quite impossible to submit to entire silence, and, without therefore stating any of the particulars that were considered objectionable, we will merely give a short description of the *modus operandi* observed in obtaining a verdict. “When this\n\nwitness for the defence stated a fact that was important for the prosecution, the solicitor for the defence winked to the interpreter (the gentleman setting as Judge knowing nothing of the language), who did not interpret it at all. The solicitor then winked to the Judge, who thereupon said, \'Court adjourned for half an hour!\' The jurors then marched respectively in pairs to partake of refreshments, with sparkling moselle, &c., prepared for them by the said solicitor. On the reappearance of all parties in Court, after a few words of badinage by the solicitor, there were also a few from the Judge, concluding with, \'But I do not mean that you should find these parties guilty!\' and the jury obediently acquitted them."" It may be said, perhaps, the jury were right. But if we could publish the whole case, it would be seen in a moment that they were wrong, and that this was well known to those who induced the jury to return such a verdict. After our last month\'s leader we do not think it necessary to make any further observations on the above, merely adding that we could wish the report of the case as we have it were in the hands of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, to whom, however, it does not belong to us to forward it.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1882#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.698, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The Queen's Speech at the opening of Parliament on February 9 contained nothing very striking or original.

One sentence in the Speech is of special interest to all our readers—we allude to that referring to the improving prospects of commerce. For years now all branches of trade—both home and foreign—have been in an abnormally depressed condition; but at last there seems to be a general consensus of opinion that on all sides things are beginning to show signs of improvement. There is one subject that we should have liked to see mentioned in the Queen's Speech, but which was conspicuous by its absence—the state of things on the West Coast of Africa, with special reference to the deposition and exile of King Ja Ja, and our lately-assumed Protectorate of the Oil Rivers. However necessary the political effacement of King Ja Ja may have been, and readily granting, for the sake of argument, that the new order of things is as greatly to the advantage of the native trader as to that of the European merchant, there are many persons, even outside the limits of those directly concerned in African commerce, who not unreasonably consider that Ja Ja has been harshly treated by the British authorities.

We are told we ought to have waited, and made proper inquiry, and then we should have found there was no truth whatever in the statement. We do not think we were unduly hasty. We did not act upon a single testimony. We received letters from several of our subscribers complaining of the alleged fact; and it was, we believe, the first time such a thing had occurred; and there did happen to be in the November number, also for the first time, certain matter which might not be quite agreeable to the authorities. The papers had been duly\n**125**\n\nposted in England, and the papers were not duly delivered in Lagos.

Niger Mission—A Warning to Native Merchants', 'section_title': '', 'content': '## A WARNING TO NATIVE MERCHANTS.\n\n### TO THE EDITOR OF ""THE AFRICAN TIMES.""\n\nSir,—Will you permit me space in your pages to show some of my brethren on the West Coast how I have been swindled by a firm of professing merchants in London, in the hope that a relation of my experience may be of service to others, and cause them to make all needful inquiries as to the good faith and solvency of those to whom they are thinking of consigning goods for realisation in the London markets, or money for purchase of goods for Africa.\n\nIn May last year I received letters from a firm dating from the City, offering to do business with me, whether in the way of realisation or purchase, and professing to have exceptional facilities for the disposal of African produce, and the purchase of European goods in exchange. They made such a plausible tale that I was quite taken with them, and forwarded a box of gold dust, together with samples of goods I wanted in return. This came duly into their hands, and I received an acknowledgment from them with a statement showing that the gold dust had realised £56 10s. 10d., but that the goods I required would cost a good deal more than that. I accordingly obtained and forwarded to them a draft, making in all £97 10s. 2d.; at the same time sending them my gold watch (value £7) for cleaning and repairs in London. This second remittance was also acknowledged in due course—and there the matter ended! Finding weeks go by, and nothing come to hand, I wrote to a firm in London, upon whose integrity I can rely, for them to inquire into the matter, and do the best they could—either in the way of getting back my money or by urging these people to hurry on with the goods, so that I might not entirely lose the market. They accordingly wrote to the firm in question several times, but only to receive vague promises of immediate attention, or still more evasive answers. So I determined myself to come to London to see what could be done. And the upshot of my inquiries is that the firm to whom I had consigned my money and goods have proved utter swindlers: they traded under a fancy name, and when they found things were getting too hot for them they left the country, so as to be beyond the reach of the law.\n\nFor myself I must make up my mind to cut my loss; as I understand that even if I could get hold of the swindlers there is no chance of my regaining any portion of what they have had from me. But I hope my experience will be of some use to others who, trading on the West Coast of Africa, are under the necessity of trusting so much to persons or firms in London or the other European capitals.—Yours faithfully,', 'last_edit_date': '1891-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1891#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TRIBUTE TO THE ""AFRICAN TIMES.""', 'section_title': '', 'content': '[We cannot refrain from making the following brief extracts from the letter of a valued correspondent.

We often find him travelling along the beach at ten o'clock at night for a boat to go on board the shipping to get himself drunk, and when he returns the next morning there must be two Krooboys beside him—one on his right hand and another on his left—to carry him home. Mr. Editor, this is the fact we are saying. When he gets home he flogs his wife, who is obliged to run to some neighbour. Shall such a man dwell amongst us, Mr. Editor?

He called himself a doctor, too; but if any of us go to him for medicine, he refuses to give us any, and, at the same time, he objects to other doctors attending us. This he did to two of us; he refused to let Dr. Spearce attend two of our boys, and through this they are dead. Who can look upon such a man and call him a man of God?

Euro-African contacts, which until the beginning of our period had been confined largely to the coastal peripheries, were, in the period under review, steadily extended inland as a result of the Industrial Revolution, largely through the efforts first of explorers, then traders and, finally, missionaries. This steady extension of European contacts and influence inland included not only guns and powder, but also railways, telegraphs, agricultural and mining machinery, the print› ing press, technical education and, above all, finance capital. These new developments created opportunities, but also challenges and dangers. Among the most novel and interesting features of African history during the period were the initiatives and reactions of African rulers and advisers in the face of these opportunities and challenges. It would appear that in most cases the approach of the Africans was not simply one of blind imitation or wholesale substitution but rather one of adaptation and syn› thesis. Instances of this process of modernization in Africa are legion. 56 Egypt built its first printing press at Büläk, Cairo, in 1822; the first printing press was established in Portuguese Luanda in 1841; the first modern mines were opened in Algeria in 1845 and in the Gold Coast in the 1870s. Some of the states, such as Ethiopia and Tunisia, embarked on public works; nearly all the Barbary states, as well as Egypt reformed their monetary systems. Other states, such as Egypt, set up textile and cotton mills, saw mills, glassworks and paper mills, all during the reign of Muhammad 'AIL But more interesting and of far-reaching consequence was the moder› nization process in the military sphere. In the face of steady European encroachment, many African states, especially in North and West Africa, modernized the organization, training, equipment and recruitment of their armies. As will be seen in later chapters, Morocco, for instance, set up at Fez an engineering school to train artillery men, surveyors, and car› tographers and sent soldiers abroad for training. Tunisia under Ahmad Bey not only reorganized its army on the lines of a Western army and adopted Western techniques and methods but also set up factories to produce modern guns and other military equipment.

Similarly, Oyo cultural influences found in eastern Yorubaland - worship of Sango, the spread of the men's loom, shoulder sling drums - must be considered not so much as evidence of Oyo hegemony before 1800 as of the nineteenth-century diaspora of the Oyo following the fall of the empire. 38 A similar influence from Benin, especially on court ceremonials, regalia and chieftaincy titles in Qwo, Ekiti, Akoko, Ondo, Ijesa - as among the Awori astride the present-day Nigeria-Benin border - showed the widespread effect of the theme of inter-group penetration and com› mensurate institutional adaptation.

It would appear that the educational activities of the missionaries had been far more successful than their evangelical activities by 1870.$^{18}$ Not only had many elementary or village schools been established but, from as early as the 1840s, teacher-training and secondary institutions were founded. The Glasgow Missionary Society, for instance, established a seminary at Lovedale in Natal in July 1841 to which an industrial department was attached.

Thus the Maghrib was already a heterogeneous society in which, roughly speaking, townsmen (h'adhar), sedentary villagers, 'tribal' groups and highlanders, especially mountain Berbers, could be distinguished.\nThe city is known to be an integral part of Islamic culture: accordingly, a string of cities stretched across the whole breadth of the Maghrib from Rabat and Fez in the west to Benghazi and Tripoli in the east, including Tlemcen, Algiers and Constantine in the Regency of Algiers and Tunis, Susa and Kayrawân in the Regency of Tunis.$^{4}$ Although these cities never accounted for more than 10 to 15 per cent of the population of the Maghrib, they constituted the focal points of the most lucrative and important activities: trade and handicrafts, some of which were developed on an all but capitalist scale, as in the case of the manufacturing of the fez - or felt cap - in Tunis;$^{5}$ religious teaching, culture, general education and religious law, based upon the study of books and written documents; and the performance of political, administrative and military functions, since the power of the Makhzen was concentrated in the towns and was more diluted in the countrysiïïº.

These facilitated, partly caused, and were also in part the result of the changes we have noted above in the political structures and military systems. More than that, there was a growing demand for labour outside the customary bounds of the household unit, the village community or age grade associations. While the various societies remained resistant to freemen selling their labour, the predominant tendency in the nineteenth century was towards expansion of the scale of slave labour, an increase in the areas in which enforced labour was used, and a greater use of migrant labour. The general trend in the third quarter of the nineteenth century was for increased slaveholding in general, even in rural areas, an increase in the number of slaves held within each household, and an increase in the use of slaves in production under quasi-capitalist conditions, thus making their lives harsher than ever before. 18 With the intensification of political rivalries from the very beginning of the century, it became usual to press disputes over land, cattle, and even doctrinal differences to the point of completely destroying the enemy as an identifiable entity. Whole communities were incorporated into existing polities or dispersed and the bulk of the young men and women taken away as captives. Such captives were used to satisfy the increasing demand for labour in agriculture, craft production and mining and also as warriors in the emerging professional armies. The new state structures and military systems diminished the importance of the old aristocracies, whose members had depended on the accumulation of wives and extended families for their social, economic and political support, but they also created new bureaucratic groups that needed to be freed from normal agricultural duties. These new aristocracies depended not on large kinship groups as such, but on large households of clients and captives who maintained increasingly large farms to provision the household as well as groups of warriors at the battlefront.

Thus, those of the middle class who engaged in trade and handicrafts had difficulty in developing their activities on autonomous lines: they had to accept the somewhat paralyzing protection of the Makhzen whenever their business interests expanded beyond a particular point. It was usual to enter into a commercial partnership with some high-ranking person, for example, the Jews Bacri and Busnach with the dey of Algiers, and the Djerban merchant, Hadjdj Yœnis bin Yünis, with the Tunisian prime minister, in about 1800. Internally, the urban 'middle class' had a preference for investing its assets in tax-farming (lizma)} Hampered as it was in its own development, the middle class could not act as a leavening agent for the transformation of society as a whole."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.509, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Sahara in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Desert trade and the nomads', 'content': 'Changes in European military technology accelerated in the latter half of the nineteenth century, with the result that European forces, armed with the latest weapons, faced opponents with outdated arms. Technological change did not only permit the conquest of the desert; it also transformed the economic life of the Sahara, as the manufacture of cheap products permitted a new phase of European penetration. Trade with Europe had existed before, but the nineteenth century witnessed a massive increase in the scale of this trade with varying effects depending on the structure of Saharan regional economies. For example, the cotton goods industry of Morocco, which had trans-Atlas outlets, succumbed after i860 to the competition of Manchester cotton goods, while the woollen textile industry of southern Tunisia fared much better and continued to feed products into trans-Saharan networks.$^{18}$ On the fringe of the Sahara various groups involved themselves in exports of primary products. For example north of the Senegal basin increased exports of gum arabic allowed a zawiya lineage, whose members specialized in Islamic scholarship and the mediation of disputes and organized trading caravans to escales on the Senegal river to gain in power and influence.19 In the area north of the Sokoto caliphate the rise ofexports ofostrich feathers and tanned goat skins in the last thirty years of the century forced nomadic ruling classes to adjust to the new¬ found ability of peasants and servile agriculturalists to earn income from collecting and selling these products.20 European economic penetration also affected the tastes of consumers, so that the custom of drinking heavily sugared tea spread during the century.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.508, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': 'Nor is the \'traditional-modern\' polar model, with all its attendant implications of conflict and incompatibility, applicable to the entire spectrum of African experience of change under colonialism. There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure. The point is that colonial Africans were probably not unaware of the elementary fact that accepting \'new forms [would] increase the range of alternatives\'$^{3}$ available to them.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.51, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The main forces of change', 'content': 'So did the introduction of Christianity which sought to abolish tradi› tional gods and beliefs.

Slaves obtained their freedom, thus forcing those who formerly depended on slave labour to do their own work for themselves or shift to dependence on wage labour. Lands hitherto reserved for gods and goblins were released either for arable use or for the siting of social institutions like the school, hospital and so on. The younger generations went to school where they learned new techniques which equipped them for employment in government, commercial firms or missions. And since these jobs were available for the most part in urban areas, it means that conversion to Christianity could also imply a predisposi› tion to live in urban areas. Or to take another example, a man could go to the urban area in search of economic advancement while being still staunchly loyal to the traditional religion.

Excess population was also absorbed by areas practising a more diversified form of agriculture, and hence able, as P. Gourou puts it, to 'capitalize their surplus population'. Here a more sedentary type of settlement finally succeeded in overcoming the hostility of environments that had been gradually broken in down the ages, and from now on became favourable to human occupation. 9\nThis material history and the political and social history of the area both throw light on each other, with no one-way determining influence. In some cases a high-density area would develop as a base for hierarchical political organizations. This is what happened in the case of two high-density areas, Mangbetu and Zande, in north-eastern Zaire. In the Mbomu valley and as far south as the Vela, the Zande area was a relatively high-density area in the nineteenth century despite murderous wars (in the 1870s Georg Schweinfurth put its population density at 40 per sq km). The agrarian system of the Zande was older than the military power of the Avungara, who only began to unify the area at the end of the eighteenth century. Under their rule, however, the term Zande became synonymous with subject-farmers; and they developed a high-yield agriculture capable of feeding a population which grew all the more rapidly because of the accumulation of captives and dependents resulting from the raiding and slave-trading of the warrior-aristocracy."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.511, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': '1 New trends in the Maghrib: Algeria, Tunisia and Libya', 'section_title': 'Rural society', 'content': ""A clear distinction was made by contemporary observers between the citydweller (h'adharî) and the country-dweller {badam).

It is nearly a hundred feet square in the interior, with towers fifteen feet square and thirty feet in height. At each angle the walls are twenty-five feet high. From the centre rises a massive tower thirty-two feet square and a hundred feet high. The walls and towers are constructed of blocks of ice taken from the St. Lawrence. They are forty inches in length, from fourteen to twenty in breadth, and as transparent as crystal. They were put in their place with derricks, and were deluged with water, which froze them into a solid mass. The roofs of the building and the towers are made of beams, upon which were spread cedar branches. Over these a spray of water was thrown, which froze them into solid masses of ice with pendant icicles.

He said: ""Electrical energy can be transmitted to a distance, and even to many thousands of miles, but can it be transformed at the distant place into mechanical or any other required form of energy nearly equal in amount to what was supplied? Unfortunately, hitherto the practical answer made by existing machines is \'No.\' But, fortunately, Joule\'s experiments and other facts tell us that in electric machines of the future, and in their connecting wires, there will be little heating, and therefore little loss. We shall, at no distant date, have great central stations, possibly situated at the bottom of coal-pits, where enormous steam engines will drive enormous electric machines. We shall have wires laid along every street, lapped into every house, as gas-pipes are at present; we shall have the quantity of electricity used in each house registered, as gas is at present; and it will be passed through little electric machines to drive machinery, to produce ventilation, to replace stoves and fires, to work apple-parers and mangles, and barbers\' brushes, among other things, as well as to give everybody an electric light. It had been supposed that to transmit the power of Niagara Falls to New York, a copper cable of enormous thickness would be needed. Professor Ayrton showed that the whole power might be transmitted by a fine copper wire, if it could only be sufficiently well insulated. He also showed that the one thing preventing our receiving the whole of our power was the mechanical friction which occurs in the machines. He showed, in fact, how to get rid of electrical friction. Professor Ayrton and himself had come to the conclusion that very large continuous current machines, with separate exciters, or perhaps even magneto-electric machines, driven very fast by steam engines, will have an important place in the future transmission of energy by electrical methods. With such machines it would be possible to heat, light, and ventilate all the houses in New York, and to give to large and small workshops the power required to drive their machinery by means of an ordinary telegraph wire (but with some exceptionally good method of insulation), transmitting energy from as great a distance as the Falls of Niagara. The experiments of Dr. Siemens showed that there could be no doubt that the introduction of electric railways everywhere was merely a question of capital and the sacrifice of much existing plant. This kind of proof was very much needed by capitalists. But the electrician saw much further; he saw better insulation for the conductor, and application of the above principles to hundreds of miles of rail instead of a thousand yards; he saw, in fact, that the larger the experiment the greater must be its success. He looked forward to the absence of a vitiated atmosphere in our underground railways. He saw that the weight of rails (for there would be no heavy locomotive in the future, each carriage would have its own driving and breaking machinery) and the cost of bridges and wear and tear of permanent way might become less than one quarter of what they are at present; he saw, in fact, all the advantages that would arise when, instead of making a heavy steam engine travel backwards and forwards with carriages, the carriages alone travel, and the steam engine is not near the railway at all. After a number of interesting experiments bearing on the subject of the storage of energy, the lecturer concluded by exhibiting models to illustrate his belief that it will become possible by electricity to enable a man in London to see an occurrence going on in a distant town.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-03-24', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1881#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.537, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The New Electric Railway at Berlin', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Our Berlin Correspondent, describing the new electric railway there, already referred to in a telegram, says that the system, which has been in use in Berlin for more than a year, has not proved a financial success. It has also been found that there is some inconvenience attending the transmission of the electric current through the rails. A horse, while crossing this line, striking it with his shoe, received a severe shock. It is impossible, moreover, to repair or remove the rails without causing a suspension of traffic over the entire route, since such removal interrupts the current. Herr Siemens, to meet these and other objections, devised his new system, which is far more practicable than the first. Over the entire line two cables are suspended parallel to and about twelve inches from each other on poles approximately 16 feet above the ground. Along these cables a system of wheels passes, connecting with the tramcar by another cable which can be detached from the car at pleasure. The cables are charged with electricity, which is generated at a station about the middle of the route, and which is taken up by the apparatus as it runs over them. It then passes through the connecting cable, down beneath the tramcar, over a system of drums which unites with the running gear. The apparatus passing along the suspended cables either precedes or follows the car. The speed of the vehicle is regulated by a crank, and a complete stop can be made as readily as if it were drawn by horses. On Saturday, during the trial, two cars were run, first separately and afterwards together. In the first case two distinct connecting cables are necessary, while in the second one answers the same purpose, the electricity passing through the car-couplings, the only difference being a diminution of velocity owing to the additional weight. The length of the route run over on the trial trip is about three miles, a portion of the distance being uphill, an inclination of 1 to 28. A car can be run up this grade at the rate of from 15 to 20 miles an hour, while on a level it will make 30 miles to the hour. After having thoroughly tested the working of the railway, visitors were driven to the country to witness the operation of a road car which Herr Siemens has invented. It also is propelled by electricity on the same principles as those described for the tramcars. It runs as smoothly as a common carriage, and is perfectly manageable. It is directed by the driver, who sits in front, by turning a wheel very similar to those used in steering ships, and is started or stopped by simple pressure made upon a lever. This car is intended to run between towns whose populations are too small to make a railway profitable pecuniarily.

Among those which have lately come to the front is the applicability of the now proved electric railway, which has been laid down and worked in the immediate vicinity of the capital of the German Empire.\n\nOn this railway, some seven English miles in length, trains impelled by electricity as the motive power have been running at a velocity of twenty miles an hour; and even a greater speed is said by Mons. Siemens, the inventor, to be attainable. One of the advantages of this system is the lightness of rail consequent upon the heavy steam locomotive being dispensed with. We are yet only in the infancy of this application of electricity as a motive power on railroads; but the results are, as stated above, already so important that there is strong reason to believe in such an employment of electricity becoming much cheaper than that of the steam locomotive, at the same time that the cost of construction of road will be very much diminished. We had intended to give a detailed account of the working of the Berlin railway, but find that our available space will not allow us to do so in the present number. The West African railways, whenever they may be constructed, will not at first require a greater speed than that which it has been already proved by the Berlin working may be easily obtained; the trains will not be heavy, nor require to be very frequently run; and in many other respects it seems to us that this invention—this new conquest of science by the application of electricity as a motive power—is full of promise for Africa in the future. We are now merely introducing the subject to the notice and attention of our readers, and defer to a future opportunity a detailed exposition of the new principle. It may after all, and we hope it will, turn out that the delay which has inevitably occurred in the introduction of railways in West Africa has not been time altogether lost, by science having prepared for her a better system than the one which has revolutionized the civilized countries of the world.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1881#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.541, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICAN TRAVELLERS AND EXPLORERS', 'section_title': '', 'content': '## RAILWAYS, THE GREAT MODERN CIVILIZER.\n\nThe great civilizer of modern times has been the railway, together with the electric telegraph, which, at its beginning, was constructed exclusively along the railway lines. The Colonies have not been slow to realize the necessity of the iron way, if they would open to agriculture their unoccupied lands, and get a ready conveyance for their produce to home and foreign markets. The mileage of railways in British India in 1878 was 8,215—an increase of nearly 900 upon the previous year, and a greater increase than had taken place before since Lord Lytton assumed the Viceroyalty. In Australia there were 3,977 miles of railway, including the horse railways which South Australia is contenting herself with until she can afford to construct more substantial lines. India has thus about twice as much railway mileage as Australia to accommodate more than ninety times the population. The Cape has made the greatest advance in this respect of all our Colonies, as she has multiplied her railroads tenfold in five years—namely, from sixty-seven miles in 1874 to 663 in 1878. The Mauritius and Jamaica have made no difference since 1870, the former having sixty-six miles, and the latter unprogressive island twenty-five. In the Dominion of Canada the extension has been from 4,002 miles in 1874 to 5,915 in 1871. Telegraph wires can, however, be stretched where the railway engineer must be content to wait. Accordingly, India had, in the year already quoted, 18,210 miles of telegraph line, or considerably more than twice the length of the railways; while in Australia the telegraph mileage was 15,515, or more than six times the railway mileage; and the Cape of Good Hope had 2,713 miles of wire.', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.513, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""As a civilizing agent: commerce is the mother of civilization, and has been, both in our days and in the earliest times, the grand engine by which the blessings of civilization and the treasures of knowledge and science are diffused.

In their A Short History of Africa which first appeared in 1962, one of the very first modern professional surveys of the history of Africa, the English historians, Roland Oliver and J. D.

What colonialism did, as both Caldwell and Afigbo have rightly emphasized (Chapters 18 and 19) and as Hopkins has contended, was to greatly accelerate the pace of this change and thereby hasten and intensify rather than begin the confrontation between Africa and Europe. But colonialism not only accelerated the pace of change but did so in a way which sought to deny the Africans themselves, who were most intimately affected, any meaningful and beneficial role. Furthermore, and this is where I part company with Hopkins, so rapid and so deep was this change that not only was the impact on the Africans really traumatic but it ended up landing the economy of Africa on a course - and a very unhealthy and exploitative one - from which it could not and has not deviated.

If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind.

The British colonies where substantial transforma- tions were registered included Egypt, Gold Coast, Nigeria, Uganda and Sierra Leone, with Kenya and the Rhodesias (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) coming after. And if we take individual colonies we discover that more changes took place in the southern than in the northern parts of Gold Coast and Nigeria.

Within French West Africa, Senegal and Dahomey (now Benin) led the way with the other colonies lagging rather far behind.\nThe fact was that the spread and impact of the forces of change were controlled by more factors than any colonial government or African group was in a position to master completely. First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape.

The Force Publique of the Belgian Congo, exhibiting the qualities both of occupation army and police force, was frequently used during this era to quell resistance expressed in the form of syncretistic religious movements.$^{29}$ On the scale of open warfare, events can be easily measured.

This date, however, seems to be too early. As G. N. Uzoigwe shows in Chapter 2, it was the activities of the French in the Senegambia region, of King Leopold of the Belgians represented by H. M. Stanley, and the French represented by Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza in the Congo region, and of the Portuguese in Central Africa that touched off the Scramble and all these activities surely did not commence until the late 1870s and early 1880s.

We had hoped that our former exposure of Cape Coast prisons, and it being known that we are never without correspondents in Cape Coast, would have insured the permanency of those sanitary reforms that ensued on our such former exposure; but we can only suppose that the virtual approval by the Colonial-office of all the official atrocities of Ussher, Parker, Skues and others by the promotion of Parker,—the whitewashing of Skues, whom, contrary to all reliable evidence, the Duke of Buckingham did not consider at all responsible for the death of poor Williams,—and the non-dismissal of Ussher and others from the service, has had the intelligible effect of inducing the present authorities there to believe that they may do whatever seemeth good in their own eyes, without fear of censure; and that to this is owing the state of the Cape Coast prison described in our last number. It is our duty to repeat it. Such a state of a Government prison is too shameful to allow of our passing it by with a mere condemnation of the atrocity of sending such a man as Mr. Lovell into it. Here is the description, reprinted from our last:—'}, {'id': 2784, 'article_title': 'FORGERIES ON THE WEST COAST.', 'full_section_title': 'FORGERIES ON THE WEST COAST.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_09_1874#article-17', 'issue_date': '30_09_1874', 'content': 'The forger has, we regret to say, been again busy on the West Coast. Some years ago, while steam communication between the West Coast and England was in its infancy, and consequently slow and infrequent, forged bills of lading, and other forged documents, from the West Coast were far from being unknown in England—so far, indeed, from being unknown that, except in the hands of merchants of position and character, it was not considered at all safe to make advances on them. With more rapid communication between Great Britain and the West Coast, the forger, having no longer time in his favour, seemed to have disappeared altogether, and we hoped and believed that he had done so; but a recent fact proves that he had not; and that, although his difficulties had been greatly increased, he might still practise his nefarious trade with temporary success. On the arrival of the steamer Africa from the West Coast ports, early in September, we received a document brought by her, purporting to be a bill of lading of eight puncheons of palm oil, shipped by the Elmina at Bonny, and consigned to us; as also another document, purporting to be a cash order for 62l., signed by the purser of the Elmina. It soon appeared that no such oil had ever been shipped on the Elmina; that the initials appended, purporting to be those of Capt. Rattray, were forged; and that the signature of the draft, purporting to be that of Mr. F. Purser, the purser of the Elmina, was also a forgery. The bill of lading stated that the oil was shipped at Bonny by W. W. Johnson. On consultation with Mr. F. Purser—being anxious, of course, to trace out the forger—we found that he had no difficulty in identifying the writing as that of a West African who embarked on board the Elmina at Fernando Po, with expressed destination to Sierra Leone; but whom Mr. F. Purser recognized as being one Shepherd, who had been convicted of forgery some time ago at Lagos. Shepherd, alias Johnson, left the steamer at Jellah Coffee, instead of going up to Sierra Leone; and Mr. Purser very thoughtfully sent some intimation on shore as to the character and identity of this new addition to the Jellah Coffee community; but the villain was rapid in his movements. He appears to have gone on at once to Quitta, and there succeeded in obtaining advances on the forged documents above mentioned. They were then sent on to us from Quitta as valuable ones, which they purported to be, and were believed to be. We entertain no doubt whatever that, having succeeded in robbing our correspondent, he found some excuse for leaving Quitta without delay—possibly, and indeed probably, by the very steamer, the Africa, which was bringing the forgeries to us. The forged bill of lading we returned by the next steamer from England to our correspondent, who had sent it to us. The forged draft we placed in the hands of Mr. F. Purser, purser of the Elmina, which left Liverpool on the 19th inst., who, by permission of the Board of Directors of the African Steamship Company, kindly promised to use every effort for stopping the criminal career of this Shepherd or Johnson, or whatever he may be now calling himself, on the West Coast. We should not have given this publicity to the deeds of the forger if our journal had been going out also by the Elmina; but as that steamer will be a fortnight in advance of the September number of the African Times, we record the facts, with the hope of preventing other innocent and unsuspecting people being imposed upon by him; and also that some of our readers may recognize him, and be instrumental in putting a stop, for a time at least, to his career of crime. The wide publicity given to matters reported by our journal, may not unreasonably be expected to produce this result, as it will be the duty of any and every one of our readers who may identify this Shepherd or Johnson in their community, to give information to all around them of the criminal course which he has hitherto pursued; so that every possible obstacle may be placed in the way of his making further victims.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Close of Another Year of the ""African Times""', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The curtain now falls over another year of the life of this journal. During eight years we have endeavoured to advocate in its columns, honestly, temperately, and fearlessly, the true interests of the West African countries, their people, and the merchants engaged in commerce with them. Great changes have taken place since the issue of the African Times commenced. The slave trade, which was then carrying off victims from the coasts of Dahomey and from the Congo, seems now to be entirely at an end, we hope and believe never to be again revived. At that period there was steam communication once a month between Liverpool and the West Coast ports; now, thanks to the establishment of the new line, there are four steam vessels to be despatched per month. This last important change ought to operate as a powerful stimulus to production and commerce, giving, as it will, so much greater facilities to the native traders to utilise their comparatively small capital in direct operation with Great Britain. With regard to the British settlements, trade and commerce cannot be expected to take their due development, until those administrative and judicial abuses which have been and will continue to be exposed and denounced by us shall have ceased. It cannot be said that life and property are safe in them while the authorities, executive and judicial, are guilty of the most illegal and arbitrary acts, and are allowed by the Colonial-office to perpetrate such acts with impunity instead of being immediately cashiered for them. But since this inclination on the part of the Home Government to throw the shield of its protection over culpable officials, rather than over the people among whom they exercise authority in its name, does unhappily exist, as recent facts most incontestably prove, it only becomes the more indispensable to create and organise a public opinion in the British settlements on the Coast that shall be powerful enough to secure for the governed a due attention to their grievances by Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, and prompt redress at his hands. To this creation and organisation of an African public opinion our most strenuous efforts will be directed in the future, as they have been incessantly in the past; and looking at what we have done in this direction during the past eight years, we think we are justified in demanding a much more liberal support from all classes on the West Coast of Africa than we have hitherto received. We have endeavoured conscientiously and zealously, without fear or favour, to carry on the work which God has put it into our hearts and hands to do, and has therefore charged us with; and those for whose present protection and permanent interests we labour have a duty also to perform towards us. We hope they will not fail in it, and in this hope we purpose (D.V.) to commence next month the ninth year's issue of the African Times."", 'last_edit_date': '1869-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1869#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.711, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Another Letter from Livingstone', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—We cannot allow 1871 to pass away without expressing our gratefulness and high appreciation of the philanthropic feelings by which you are impelled to advocate the cause of Africa and her injured myriads from beneath the lash of official tyranny and oppression, and from the taunts, scoffs, and political venom of the negro-haters.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters. Is it necessary to add that wherever such a state of things existed or may exist a colony is sure of being misgoverned?', 'last_edit_date': '1866-04-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1866#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ADDRESS BY THE EDITOR TO SUBSCRIBERS AND FRIENDS OF THE ""AFRICAN TIMES.""', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A combined and powerful attack has been lately made upon the African Times, to destroy its existence, if possible, and deprive the educated African people and their less advanced countrymen of that power of appeal to the public opinion of Great Britain which they now possess through its columns.

During that period the whole of the anxiety, labour, and responsibility, both public and pecuniary, which it has involved, have been borne by one individual, the Editor. When first started, he undertook, subject to the condition of a certain number of copies being subscribed for individually by some members of the Council of the African-Aid Society, that it should never involve that society in any pecuniary loss or responsibility. Contrary to his opinion as to the conditions under which a public journal could be successfully conducted, and submitted to by him solely with the object of facilitating its establishment, a committee of a few members of the council of that society was appointed to meet monthly, prior to its publication, for considering the articles, &c., which the Editor had decided to insert. But to this the Editor attached a stipulation that he would not consent to any alterations of which he did not himself fully approve, and which he did not consider advisable or innocuous. Such a committee of course could not work, and the Editor freed himself almost immediately from the nominal restriction, which only served to increase the difficulty of bringing out the paper on the proper day, without effecting any useful purpose whatever. A perfect and entire independence of thought and opinion in the editor is essential to the success of any and every public journal. During five years, therefore, the whole labour and responsibility have, as before stated, rested with one individual, the present Editor. Such an anniversary as this is therefore a solemn one with us. The objects the Editor has endeavoured ever to keep in view have been the promotion of good government in the British African colonies and settlements, to force a removal of official abuses, to promote material development and increased facilities of transit and trade, as auxiliaries to missionary effort, and as indispensable, not to the reception of Christianity, but to the existence and spread of Christian civilization in Africa. Having entered upon this work with a deep sense of responsibility to God, we feel bound to ask ourselves how that work has been performed. With the measure and extent of its success we have nothing to do, that we leave in the hands of Him who worketh through individual agencies on the earth, according to His own infinite wisdom. But have we done our duty by the African people, and have they, on their side, done their duty towards us? As regards the former, we can only look to our motives and our desires. We have endeavoured to keep a watchful guard over ourselves as ""one who must give an account before God,"" and we have, with no small sacrifice of time and rest, conscientiously striven to give to Africa in our labours whatever talent or wisdom God may have bestowed upon us for that purpose. As regards the latter, we think we have cause of rejoicing rather than of complaint. The number of our African subscribers has continuously increased, filling up, in a way most satisfactory to us, the gaps in our subscription list caused by the withdrawals of those of our early friends who considered, we suppose, that no further effort on their part was necessary to our support. And we have given a voice—a public voice to Africa. Few people in England, unfortunately, care much about her or her concerns. The English Anti-Slavery party, fully occupied in their high and noble object of the eradication of negro slavery everywhere, have not yet had time generally to recognise the importance of paving the way, and preparing for, and aiding in the work of Christian civilization in Africa itself.

But there is no engagement to continue to furnish such a quantity monthly, although the intention is to do so if the funds will allow. The paper is edited and conducted gratuitously; and all that can be obtained from the sale of copies and from advertisements is devoted to its improvement and enlargement. But unless a special fund were raised for the paper the Editor cannot risk loss. Eight pages of the size now issued are nearly equal to twelve of the previous size. The Editor hopes, however, by the blessing of God, to maintain the issue at twelve, and even at sixteen pages of the new and increased size. Subscribers may aid in this by obtaining ADVERTISEMENTS and other SUBSCRIBERS for the journal, without which it cannot be accomplished. They should bear in mind that although their five shillings per annum per copy, including postage or delivery, is a shilling or two a-year dearer than some other journals of a similar size and paper are supplied at, the AFRICAN TIMES is a special paper, that will only be taken by a special class of readers—that it cannot hope to be popularised into cheapness except as education and civilization progress on the West Coast of Africa—and that in return for that individual sacrifice of a shilling or two a-year the Editor gives time, anxiety, and such little talent as he may possess, without any reward, save the hope that he may be in some measure advancing the great cause of Christian civilization and industrial development in Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1865#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True
1636,The press was instrumental in challenging colonial injustices and advocating for accountability and the rights of African communities in colonial Africa.,"The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide substantial support for the claim that the press was instrumental in challenging colonial injustices and advocating for accountability and the rights of African communities in colonial Africa. The General History of Africa highlights the role of newspapers, pamphlets, and journals in mobilizing literary imagination against colonialism, documenting abuses, and serving as platforms for anti-colonial sentiment. Publications like Africano and O Brado Africano are noted for their vigorous denunciation of colonial abuses, such as forced labor and poor working conditions, and for advocating for the rights of African workers. The press is described as a constant source of worry for colonial administrators, indicating its effectiveness in challenging colonial authority. The proliferation of newspapers during the inter-war period is identified as a key tactic in the nationalist movement, with the press playing a crucial role in diffusing nationalist activities and impacting colonial policies through international congresses and pan-African movements. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize the publication's role in exposing abuses and advocating for judicial reforms, such as the restoration of trial by jury, which was withdrawn by the Blackall Ordinance. The African Times consistently criticized colonial officials for misconduct and served as a platform for public grievances, urging the British government to address injustices. The articles underscore the importance of an independent press in holding colonial authorities accountable and fostering public opinion to secure redress for grievances. The African Times' efforts to promote good governance, expose administrative abuses, and support the Christian civilization and industrial development of Africa further demonstrate the press's pivotal role in advocating for African rights and challenging colonial injustices. Together, these sources underscore the critical role of the press in advocating for African rights and challenging colonial injustices.","The paragraphs from the General History of Africa textbook provide substantial support for the claim that the press was instrumental in challenging colonial injustices and advocating for accountability and the rights of African communities in colonial Africa.

But so long as demijohn follows demijohn of rum ... no reinforcements of missionaries and no homilies from professional philanthropists, on the blessing of European civilization will avail anything. 43 An ardent campaigner for Africa-oriented educational reforms, Grant, deeply influenced by Blyden, sought an educational system which had the university at its apex but only as an institution which was designed to provide research and teaching in fields related to Africa, as opposed to the 'conventional literary education which emphasized European culture and values'.

Thus Margery Perham: most of the tribes quickly accepted European rule as part of an irresist› ible order, one which brought many benefits, above all peace, and exciting novelties, railways and roads, lamps, bicycles, ploughs, new foods and crops, and all that could be acquired and experienced in town and city. For the ruling classes, traditional or created, it brought a new strength and security of status and new forms of wealth and power. For many years after annexation, though there was much bewilderment, revolts were very few, and there does not appear to have been much sense of indignity at being ruled. ' ' Such ideas are also reflected in the use of such Eurocentric terms as 'pacification', Pax Britannica and Pax Gallica used to describe what amounted to the conquest and occupation of Africa between 1890 and 1914. Those historians who did pay some attention to this subject mentioned it almost accidentally or casually. In their A Short History of Africa which first appeared in 1962, one of the very first modern professional surveys of the history of Africa, the English historians, Roland Oliver and J. D. Fage, devoted only a single paragraph to what they termed 'bitter resistance' by Africans in a chapter of fourteen pages dealing with what has become known as the European Scramble for African colonies. It is to correct this wrong interpretation of the colonial school and to redress the balance and highlight the African perspective that we have devoted as many as seven chapters to this theme of African initiatives and reactions."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Black American evangelism in Africa', 'content': ""At the Congress, Bishop Turner renewed his advocacy of black emi› gration to Liberia.

However, colonialism proved just as ephemeral as any other institution created and maintained by force. Within a matter of only some forty-five years from 1935, the colonial system had been uprooted from over 90% of Africa and confined only to that part of the continent south of the Limpopo River. That is to say, colonial› ism lasted in most parts of Africa for under a hundred years, indeed from the 1880s to the 1960s. In the history of a people and a whole continent, this is a very brief span indeed. How and why this incredible feat of the uprooting of colonialism was accomplished, or, to quote the words of Margery Perham, why this 'astonishingly rapid emancipation since 1950' ' form two of the main themes of the concluding volume of this History. In the concluding chapter of this volume, however, we would like to address ourselves to two main questions. First, what legacies did colonialism bequeath to Africa, or what impact did it make on Africa? The second question is, in view of this impact or balance sheet, what is the significance of colonialism for Africa? Does it constitute a revolutionary or important episode in the history of the continent? Was it a major break with the past of the continent, or was it, after all, a mere passing event which did not constitute a break in the history of the continent? Or as L. H.

One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority. Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage. The indigenous elites have patronized change as a way of getting Africa on to her feet and making her states equal members of the community of nations."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 594, 'article_title': 'THE GAMBIA', 'full_section_title': 'THE GAMBIA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1865#article-2', 'issue_date': '23_05_1865', 'content': ""We regret to receive renewed complaints of the non-delivery of the _African Times_ to certain of our subscribers in this colony.

The people on the West Coast now feel that the only protection they have is in the publicity that may be given to judgments in the columns of the _African Times_. There are so many influences, internal and external, to warp the minds of judges and magistrates acting without a jury, that extreme watchfulness is indispensable now that the protection afforded by the latter is withdrawn. The pure, equable, unimpassioned administration of justice between man and man is of so much importance as regards the progress of Christian civilization in our colonies and settlements on the West Coast of Africa, that the people there may rely upon us for all the protection which the press in our hands can afford. But we would remind them that for the press to effect good, it must be impartial, and its reports must be correct; there must be no misrepresentation in the accounts sent to us—no colouring of interest or passion; and where the evidence on which judgments are complained of cannot be at the same time given us, the greatest care should be taken that not one statement is made that cannot be shown by the evidence whenever that may be produced. Judges and magistrates on the Coast will also do well to bear in mind that the additional powers lately conferred on them by the iniquitous Ordinance of Nov. 16, 1866, involve greatly increased responsibility; that, having now uncontrolled power in cases brought before them over the pockets and fortunes of the litigants, they must expect their whole conduct will be closely watched; that they are morally bound to avoid all associations and acts that could give any ground for suspicion that the judgments they pronounce are influenced or otherwise affected by anything beyond the evidence submitted in court; that, as the visible representatives of Justice, they ought to keep her character unspotted in their hands, and give continual public evidence that they are themselves under the influence of all those moral restraints the obligation of which on others they are supposed to enforce.'}, {'id': 1897, 'article_title': 'The Colonial-office and Administration of Justice on the West Coast', 'full_section_title': 'The Colonial-office and Administration of Justice on the West Coast', 'last_edit_date': '09-23-1870', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1870#article-17', 'issue_date': '23_09_1870', 'content': ""\n\nto protest and struggle against the wrong that has thus been committed, until that wrong shall have been redressed by the restoration of the jury-box in the courts of civil law; but our duty at the present time is with the action of the Colonial-office under that system of wrong which it has itself created. If, as happily is not the case, we had been forced by conclusive evidence to admit that there was some ground of justification for such system of wrong, we should nevertheless have expected that the Colonial-office would have been most jealously watchful that it did not aggravate that wrong by appointing and retaining in judicial and magisterial offices men justly obnoxious to those who had been despoiled of their long-enjoyed rights to intervene and decide as jurors in matters of complaint and dispute among their fellow-citizens and subjects. But it has long been too flagrantly glaring that, instead of any such jealous watchfulness for the people, there has only been watchfulness to support and uphold their nominees, even against the most just complaints. The continuance of Mr. Justice Huggins on the bench of the Supreme Court in Sierra Leone, against whom ten petitions to the Secretary of State have been forwarded, and there have been established in the judgment of every impartial man allegations and charges which should have caused his immediate removal from the exercise of any judicial functions in that settlement, is one, and a very flagrant, instance of this; and we have now to record what, in the absence of any published justifying grounds, seems to us another. Some six or eight months ago we gave some accounts of proceedings in the court of Chief Magistrate Way, at Lagos, in which his conduct and decision seem to have been so influenced by his sympathy for a European offender and against the injured African as to amount to a gross denial of justice. We were the more free in our remarks on the case because of a similar miscarriage of justice in the very gross crime of the European clerk, Lubley, against an African girl of only seven or eight years of age; and although we do not pretend that we may not sometimes be misled for a short time in our appreciation of certain facts by exaggeration or even falsehood, we were justified in believing that we were right on that occasion (the charges against Stott, master of the steamer, Thomas Bazley), not only by the evidence in our hands, but by the action of the Administrator of Lagos, Captain Glover, who suspended Mr. Way from any further exercise of his magisterial duties—a suspension which, of course not without examination of evidence, was approved and confirmed by the Governor-in-Chief. Under these circumstances Mr. Benjamin Way came to England, and the people of Lagos thought they were rid of him, until about a couple of months ago, when he reappeared in Lagos and resumed his office, under mandate from Downing-street, to the public astonishment and dismay. We enter our earnest protest against this unmerited official outrage to the public feeling of Lagos and official insult to Administrator Glover and Sir Arthur Kennedy, the Governor-in-Chief. We do not say that a suspension by them of a chief magistrate should and necessarily must, right or wrong, be confirmed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies; but we do say that so stinging a rebuke by the Colonial-office to such officials as the Governor-in-Chief and the Administrator of Lagos, as well as outrage to the people of Lagos, ought not to have been hazarded by the Colonial-office without a simultaneous public statement of the grounds on which they differed with the Governor-in-Chief and the Administrator and people of Lagos, and of the evidence, new perhaps, which made it indispensable in their eyes, as a matter of justice to the individual, to reinstate him in office, at the risk of lowering the prestige of Governor and Administrator with the people in all the West Coast Settlements. It may be necessary for Sir Arthur Kennedy and Captain Glover to pass this by in silence. The Colonial-office, though obstinate in the defence of their Coast officials, so long as they evince a due subserviency to that corrupt department of Her Majesty's Government, are not likely to tolerate any independent action on their part; and governors and administrators cannot be expected to ruin their future official prospects, by any prolonged opposition to Downing-street behests. We feel quite sure in our own minds that to such considerations as this, and to such only, we owe the absence of any open declaration of Sir Arthur Kennedy against the continuance of Mr. Justice Huggins as Judge in the Supreme Court at Sierra Leone. It is impossible that it can be otherwise. We do not believe that any two independent men of ordinary capacity out of the Colonial-office could differ as to the propriety of removing Mr. Justice Huggins to some other sphere of action, where he might have the chance of redeeming his reputation as a judge; but as the responsibility rests with the Colonial-office when they override the opinions and decisions of their governors and administrators on the Coast, we cannot be surprised that these yield to the power which made, and may unmake, them. And here it is, on occasions and in circumstances such as these, that an independent public press shows itself to be invaluable. We only bow to Colonial-office decisions when it is clearly evident that they are right and just. We know they are not right and just as regards Mr. Justice Huggins. We believe they are not right and just as regards Mr. Benjamin Way. It is not enough for us that the judge or the magistrate, or both, should have been gravely rebuked and admonished by the Colonial-office, if they are retained in power in those same localities in which their errors and offences were committed. Where a judge and a magistrate justly incur official rebuke and admonition, they ought to be held as having incurred the necessity of removal. We have not at any time a desire to ruin any man in his career; but we are bound to demand that the interests and welfare of the people and the settlements shall be held to be superior to those of the individual; and we therefore unhesitatingly say that Mr. Justice Huggins ought to be removed from Sierra Leone, and Mr. Benjamin Way from Lagos. In the absence of any such just regard for the feelings and interests of the people in Sierra Leone and Lagos as would be evinced by the removal of this judge and magistrate, we shall feel it our duty when Parliament reassembles (if, happily, the desolating war now waging between France and Germany be then terminated) to use all our efforts for obtaining the full consideration of these two cases of Mr. Justice Huggins and Mr. Benjamin Way in both Houses of the Imperial Legislature—the last resort of subjects wronged and injured by official error and injustice.""}, {'id': 2834, 'article_title': 'RECOMPENSE TO NATIVE OFFICIALS FOR SERVICES DURING THE WAR.', 'full_section_title': 'RECOMPENSE TO NATIVE OFFICIALS FOR SERVICES DURING THE WAR.', 'last_edit_date': '11-30-1874', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_11_1874#article-13', 'issue_date': '30_11_1874', 'content': 'We have to bear the burden of many griefs and sorrows. The cries of those who suffer injustice are ever filling our ears. As Editor of the African Times, we are supposed to have the power to redress every wrong and remove every grievance under which people may be suffering on the West Coast of Africa. There is in this a great tribute to the power of an independent public press, as well as to us in our editorial capacity; and we can only deplore that our success is not always on a par with our desires as regards the matters in which we are implored to render aid. Without being thus implored, we felt it to be a duty last month to bring prominently under notice the insufficient recognition and non-requital of most efficient and important services performed by the Bonny Contingent during Sir Garnet Wolseley\'s march to Kumasi. We take this opportunity to call official attention anew to what we then urged as being due to Prince Charles Peppel, Mr. Jumbo, and the tried valiant men whom they so successfully led in that Ashanti Expedition. Such just claims have, we feel convinced, only been accidentally overlooked, not wilfully neglected, and will be recognized and satisfied. We are only sorry that it should have been at all necessary again to remind Her Majesty\'s Government of them. In that reminder we laid it down as an axiom that ""a great country should never be unmindful of services rendered, or defer the reward due to those who have rendered them;"" and put forward the incontrovertible fact, that the greatest States and Governments have their times of perplexity and need, when the feeble aid of others, who are very insignificant in their eyes, may be of great importance. What we then applied as regards the services of a body of men, we now apply as regards an individual. We are pained to say that there has been, owing to what cause we know not, a lack of proper consideration as regards individual claims at Cape Coast, since the happy conclusion of the late war. Many instances have been brought under our notice, but although we had no doubt as to the reality of the wrong complained of, the circumstances were such as required more examination than we could possibly make, before we could have felt justified in publicly calling attention to them. The friends, however, of a man named G. B. Duker, have placed his case before us in a way that fully justifies our notice of it. Among the many extraordinary duties that had to be performed during the war, there was one of great importance; that was, the faithful and diligent receipt and transmission of despatches and other communications from and to the army in the field. We heard so many praises at the time of the regularity and unswerving assiduity and faithfulness with which that service was performed, that we must confess we were under the impression that they were performed by some European official, who had been specially detailed to the office of Military Postmaster. We now find we were in error on this point, and that the person placed in that most responsible position is a native of the Gold Coast—one who has never been in England, but who has obtained the knowledge he possesses, and the acquirements which enabled him to discharge such duties, in the Wesleyan Missionary Schools there. Most important official despatches and letters, were daily and hourly, passing through his hands, and he was solely responsible for them. They were the despatches and letters, as his friends remind us, ""to and from the British Government and the Commander-in-Chief, Sir Garnet Wolseley; Sir Garnet Wolseley\'s Staff, the 42nd Highlanders, the 23rd Fusiliers, the Rifle Brigade, the Naval Brigade, the 1st and 2nd West India Regiments, Colonel Wood\'s Native Regiment, Major Russell\'s Regiment, the Cape Coast Rifle Corps, the Army Service Corps, the Army Medical Corps, and the Royal Engineers. All their important and official despatches, letters, and correspondence passed safely through his hands, more especially those from headquarters at the front, and the commanding officers at their respective posts, en route to Kumasi."" After perusing this list, we are not surprised to learn that the work to be performed, and which was faithfully and punctually performed, was an arduous one, entailing great personal sacrifices on the individual in question.

We have throughout our editorial career earnestly endeavoured to perform this duty—not with so much success as we could have desired. Government servants, from the highest to the lowest, in Crown Colonies form a serried phalanx that it is difficult for any assailant to penetrate. There is an _esprit de corps_, from the lowest grade of European Crown Colony officials up to and including Downing-street, that has made it almost a superhuman task to procure redress for a wrong committed by the Executive of a Crown Colony. We have had but too much experience of this, our rebuffs having been such that nothing but a full conviction of our being right could have prevented our writing ourselves down as assininely incompetent to distinguish between good and evil, between right and wrong, between even-handed justice and flagrant oppression. Such has been the past in our editorial career. We fancy that we now see a gleam of light justifying in us a hope of better things to come. Some changes that have taken place at the Gambia, attributed to our efforts, are encouraging, as evidencing that the ear and judgment of the present Chief of the Colonial Office, the Earl of Kimberley, are not entirely monopolized by officialism; and in ruminating on the letter which we inserted in our last number, headed ""The African Kings Transported by the late Governor Ussher,"" we have ventured to indulge the hope that if the noble Secretary of State for the Colonies will only admit that the decisions and acts of the Governors of Crown Colonies are not infallible, we may yet obtain some atonement for injustice to some deeply injured persons. With this hope, and the ideas that have sprung from it, we give insertion in our present number to two other letters from Accra bearing on the same subject, of the gross injustice done to the Kings Tackie and Assafo Ajaye, and the deep national disgrace involved in it; for an oppression of the weak and helpless is a deep national disgrace. As such, it touches us nearly, and incites us to persistent action, seeing that we have now in office in England a Government bold and courageous in the cause of right, as evidenced in what they have recently done in the matter of the Transvaal, which no one in his senses could doubt the power of Great Britain to subdue and retain had she so determined. And as we have some faith in the equity of the present Home Government, so have we also in that of the new Governor-in-Chief of the Gold Coast Colony, Sir Samuel Rowe. We hope he will feel that he has nothing to do with the acts of his predecessors, and is not at all bound to uphold them where they were wrong, but, on the contrary, as having the honour of Great Britain in his hands, is bound, in duty to himself and to his country, to remove for the latter the stigma that attaches to her in the minds of thoughtful, impartial men, not only as regards the treatment of Kings Tackie and Assafo Ajaye, but also as regards that of King Ennemil Quow, of Wassaw, on whose behalf we in vain sent in our remonstrances to Downing-street during the Colonial Secretaryship of Sir M. Hicks-Beach, when it was the fashion to uphold Government officials in the colonies in all their acts, however unjust and oppressive, and, we may even add, however ignorant and stupid they may have been, especially if they had in them a flavour of Imperialism.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Close of Another Year of the ""African Times""', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The curtain now falls over another year of the life of this journal. During eight years we have endeavoured to advocate in its columns, honestly, temperately, and fearlessly, the true interests of the West African countries, their people, and the merchants engaged in commerce with them. Great changes have taken place since the issue of the African Times commenced. The slave trade, which was then carrying off victims from the coasts of Dahomey and from the Congo, seems now to be entirely at an end, we hope and believe never to be again revived. At that period there was steam communication once a month between Liverpool and the West Coast ports; now, thanks to the establishment of the new line, there are four steam vessels to be despatched per month. This last important change ought to operate as a powerful stimulus to production and commerce, giving, as it will, so much greater facilities to the native traders to utilise their comparatively small capital in direct operation with Great Britain. With regard to the British settlements, trade and commerce cannot be expected to take their due development, until those administrative and judicial abuses which have been and will continue to be exposed and denounced by us shall have ceased. It cannot be said that life and property are safe in them while the authorities, executive and judicial, are guilty of the most illegal and arbitrary acts, and are allowed by the Colonial-office to perpetrate such acts with impunity instead of being immediately cashiered for them. But since this inclination on the part of the Home Government to throw the shield of its protection over culpable officials, rather than over the people among whom they exercise authority in its name, does unhappily exist, as recent facts most incontestably prove, it only becomes the more indispensable to create and organise a public opinion in the British settlements on the Coast that shall be powerful enough to secure for the governed a due attention to their grievances by Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, and prompt redress at his hands. To this creation and organisation of an African public opinion our most strenuous efforts will be directed in the future, as they have been incessantly in the past; and looking at what we have done in this direction during the past eight years, we think we are justified in demanding a much more liberal support from all classes on the West Coast of Africa than we have hitherto received.

The African Times brings them, as well as their rulers, face to face with British public opinion, by which they have much to gain in the work to which we hope they all feel themselves pledged—viz., that of the Christian civilization of the whole African people, and the industrial development of those great natural resources with which Africa has been so liberally endowed.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-07-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_07_1865#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.721, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Another Letter from Livingstone', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—We cannot allow 1871 to pass away without expressing our gratefulness and high appreciation of the philanthropic feelings by which you are impelled to advocate the cause of Africa and her injured myriads from beneath the lash of official tyranny and oppression, and from the taunts, scoffs, and political venom of the negro-haters. When we review the history of our country from the time of the publication of that valuable journal of which you are the honoured editor—a periodical which stands eminent in consequence of the incalculable benefit it has conferred upon us—we say, when we contrast Africa\'s past with her present; when we look upon the many moral changes the African Times has effected, we could not but classify it amongst the means employed by Divine goodness towards the regeneration of a people who, according to the views of the anthropologist, are deprived of that vital essence which constitutes man the chief of God\'s creatures; hence with them the negro is calculated to be unfit for any other position than to become ""a beast of burden and a beast for prey"" to his more favoured brother.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters. Is it necessary to add that wherever such a state of things existed or may exist a colony is sure of being misgoverned?', 'last_edit_date': '1866-04-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1866#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.717, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE DEMAND OF PROTECTION IN RETURN FOR DUTIES LEVIED', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The obligations of governments and subjects are reciprocal. Forgetfulness or disregard of this has brought many governments to ruin. There is no Divine right of misgovernment, or neglect of the proper duties of government. If subjects owe an unswerving obedience, and this we should be one of the last to deny, government owes in return to its subjects that effective protection which is indispensable to the wellbeing of a community. Where the people have achieved and secured for themselves an adequate representation in the government, or have had this wisely conferred upon them, this debt of government to its subjects is pretty certain of being paid; and where it is not so paid, the people are, then, parties to their own wrong. The West African people, subjects of the British Crown, are not in this category. All voice in the management of their own affairs has hitherto been refused to them, and they have not been parties to the evils under which they are suffering. That there are evils, and great and gross ones, no one can deny who has read the powerful ""Bathurst"" letter of ""Nobody,"" in our last months\' issue, supplemented by the heavy complaints of the merchants and tradesmen of ""Accra,"" alluded to in this present number. There can scarcely be a heavier reproach to a Government than that it seems to exist only to collect revenue for the benefit of favoured officials, and for squandering on objects that do nothing in the development of material resources, or in the moral and Christian elevation of communities. Although our space will not allow of our entering fully on this subject at present, our sense of duty prevents our sending this month\'s paper to press without recording anew our protest against the continuance in West Africa of such an insulting and injurious burlesque on government as now exists there; and notably in the Gambia and on the Gold Coast.

During that period the whole of the anxiety, labour, and responsibility, both public and pecuniary, which it has involved, have been borne by one individual, the Editor. When first started, he undertook, subject to the condition of a certain number of copies being subscribed for individually by some members of the Council of the African-Aid Society, that it should never involve that society in any pecuniary loss or responsibility. Contrary to his opinion as to the conditions under which a public journal could be successfully conducted, and submitted to by him solely with the object of facilitating its establishment, a committee of a few members of the council of that society was appointed to meet monthly, prior to its publication, for considering the articles, &c., which the Editor had decided to insert. But to this the Editor attached a stipulation that he would not consent to any alterations of which he did not himself fully approve, and which he did not consider advisable or innocuous. Such a committee of course could not work, and the Editor freed himself almost immediately from the nominal restriction, which only served to increase the difficulty of bringing out the paper on the proper day, without effecting any useful purpose whatever. A perfect and entire independence of thought and opinion in the editor is essential to the success of any and every public journal. During five years, therefore, the whole labour and responsibility have, as before stated, rested with one individual, the present Editor. Such an anniversary as this is therefore a solemn one with us. The objects the Editor has endeavoured ever to keep in view have been the promotion of good government in the British African colonies and settlements, to force a removal of official abuses, to promote material development and increased facilities of transit and trade, as auxiliaries to missionary effort, and as indispensable, not to the reception of Christianity, but to the existence and spread of Christian civilization in Africa. Having entered upon this work with a deep sense of responsibility to God, we feel bound to ask ourselves how that work has been performed. With the measure and extent of its success we have nothing to do, that we leave in the hands of Him who worketh through individual agencies on the earth, according to His own infinite wisdom. But have we done our duty by the African people, and have they, on their side, done their duty towards us? As regards the former, we can only look to our motives and our desires. We have endeavoured to keep a watchful guard over ourselves as ""one who must give an account before God,"" and we have, with no small sacrifice of time and rest, conscientiously striven to give to Africa in our labours whatever talent or wisdom God may have bestowed upon us for that purpose. As regards the latter, we think we have cause of rejoicing rather than of complaint. The number of our African subscribers has continuously increased, filling up, in a way most satisfactory to us, the gaps in our subscription list caused by the withdrawals of those of our early friends who considered, we suppose, that no further effort on their part was necessary to our support. And we have given a voice—a public voice to Africa. Few people in England, unfortunately, care much about her or her concerns. The English Anti-Slavery party, fully occupied in their high and noble object of the eradication of negro slavery everywhere, have not yet had time generally to recognise the importance of paving the way, and preparing for, and aiding in the work of Christian civilization in Africa itself.

We expurgated the chief communication we had received, which was a long report of a criminal case brought before one of the Courts, and incidents in the trial. We did not name the Court, nor the presiding Judge, nor the parties concerned.
