The ""General History of Africa"" textbook provides a nuanced perspective, highlighting successful agricultural practices in challenging environments, such as the Ovambo's irrigation and livestock management in southern Angola, and historical mining activities in regions like Southern Rhodesia and the Gold Coast, which indicate the presence of valuable mineral resources. However, it also emphasizes challenges such as irregular rainfall, arid conditions, and the exploitative nature of colonial resource extraction, which often excluded local populations from economic benefits. The colonial legacy left many African states with monocrop economies and limited diversification, complicating the narrative of untapped potential. In contrast, The African Times articles describe Central Africa as a ""magnificent country"" with fertile soil, a healthy climate, and abundant natural resources, including minerals, vegetation, and wildlife. They highlight the potential for agriculture with crops like cotton, coffee, and sugar-cane, and the presence of valuable minerals such as gold, iron, and coal. The articles also note the interest of European powers in exploring and annexing African territories, recognizing the continent's economic potential, while acknowledging challenges such as the need for organized labor, infrastructure development, and overcoming the negative impacts of the slave trade. Together, these sources illustrate both the promise and the complexities of realizing the economic potential of Africa's interior regions.","The ""General History of Africa"" textbook provides a nuanced view of the interior regions of Africa, which both supports and refutes the claim that these areas are fertile, resource-rich, and hold significant untapped economic potential. On one hand, the textbook highlights the successful agricultural practices in challenging environments, such as the Ovambo's irrigation and livestock management in southern Angola, which suggests a degree of fertility and potential for development. Additionally, the historical mining activities in regions like Southern Rhodesia and the Gold Coast indicate the presence of valuable mineral resources, supporting the notion of untapped economic potential. However, the text also emphasizes the challenges faced by these regions, such as irregular rainfall, arid conditions, and the exploitative nature of colonial resource extraction, which often excluded local populations from benefiting economically. Furthermore, the colonial legacy left many African states with monocrop economies and limited diversification, which could hinder development. Thus, while there are elements that align with the claim, the textbook also presents significant obstacles and historical exploitation that complicate the narrative of untapped potential.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that the interior regions of Africa are fertile, resource-rich, and hold significant untapped economic potential. The articles describe Central Africa as a ""magnificent country"" with a fertile soil, a healthy climate, and abundant natural resources, including minerals, vegetation, and wildlife. The exploration of these regions has revealed their potential for agriculture, with crops like cotton, coffee, and sugar-cane growing abundantly. The articles also highlight the presence of valuable minerals such as gold, iron, and coal, and the potential for economic development through trade and infrastructure improvements, such as railways and highways. Furthermore, the articles mention the interest of European powers in exploring and annexing African territories, indicating a recognition of the continent's economic potential. However, the articles also acknowledge challenges such as the need for organized labor, infrastructure development, and overcoming the negative impacts of the slave trade.

Moreover the conquest of relatively poor soils represents one of nineteenth-century African agriculture's greatest triumphs. Coupled with stockbreeding, it made possible the con› solidation of human settlement, for example, in the difficult regions of southern Angola.\nThis is sandy, arid country characterized by irregular rainfall. Southern Angolan societies were split up into a great variety of peoples distinguished from each other by their terrain and the varying importance they attached to agriculture and stockbreeding. Ethnic solidarity among the peoples of this region resulted from sharing a common historical experience; that is, both political experience in the form of states that developed from the end of the eighteenth century onwards and also economic experience dictated by environmental similarities. All these peoples, of whom the Kwanyama 12 are the most numerous, have come to be known as the Ovambo. Next among the Ovambo, but much smaller, come the Ndongo, Kwambi, etc. They all live in the Cuvelai river basin, in an area bounded by the Cunene and the Cubango (Okavango). The rise of the Cuvelai and the flooding of the grassy savannas enabled the Ovambo to overcome the drought and make the inhabited areas of the region described by nineteenth-century travellers look like gardens.

Either minerals had been known and worked long before the colonial era, or deposits were found by men who were specifically searching for minerals. Before the colonial era both Southern Rhodesia and the Gold Coast, where the local population had mined and worked gold for generations, were noted for their potential mineral wealth rather than their agricultural prospects. In Nigeria, too, the local population had mined and worked tin for generations before the white men penetrated the interior. Thus in a number of cases prospecting during the colonial period started with locating areas where mining had been carried out by the local population. Expectations of growing rich overnight attracted many Europeans and much capital into Southern Rhodesia from the 1890s, but a 'Second Rand' was not found, only small deposits being located.

Two main reasons accounted for this feature. First, there were cases where capital on a scale beyond the ability of Africans was required, for example in copper mining in Northern Rhodesia and iron-ore mining in Sierra Leone. Second, and this had a wider applicability, the colonial administrations deliberately and systematically excluded Africans from benefiting from the mineral resources of their country. Soon after mineral deposits were found a series of legislative measures was introduced to give monopolies to imperialist interests. Even where Africans had been working minerals for generations, it became illegal for the African to be found in possession of minerals without a licence. No Africans were allowed to deal in diamond mining. The industry, both in Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast, was monopolized by the Consolidated African Selection Trust (CAST), a powerful multinational company engaged in mining a number of minerals. This monopoly was granted on the pretext that the diamonds market could not be controlled where a number of dealers were operating. Whatever the rationale, bowing to the pressure of international capital, the colonial administration viciously excluded the local population from this most lucrative industry of the day. The Sierra Leone Selection Trust (SLST) was given exclusive rights to prospect for, mine and dispose of all diamonds for 99 years beginning in 1933."" It was not until the 1950s, when it became impossible to police the extensive diamondiferous areas, that the government was forced to legalize African participation. 54 But even in the cases where Africans could take mining licences from the beginning, a number of regulations and technicalities minimized African participation. In the Nigerian tin-mining industry, for instance, it was a crime for the mine owner, in his absence, to leave the mine under the charge of an African, regardless of his qualifications.$^{55}$ In Sierra Leone an African could not secure a mining licence unless he could read and understand the Mining Ordinance of 1927, which was written in English. Thus inability to read English disqualified an individual outright from participating in mining.$^{56}$ All the same, mining was established as a viable industry.\nThe export sector of the countries under discussion, comprising mainly agricultural products and minerals, expanded fast.

Further south it was a different world, that of Upper Guinea, where decentralized farming peoples, speaking mostly West Atlantic languages, had long occupied the sea coast. From Monrovia to the Gambia, the Sudanic zone only began to have contacts with the sea coast in the eighteenth century. This region was also one of the earliest centres of European influence in Guinea-Bissau, home of Creole culture, and later Sierra Leone and Liberia. Like Senegambia, this region was important for the slave trade in the sixteenth century, though, in the eighteenth century, its role declined.\nOutside the coastal area, the two most important peoples were the Mandinka and the Fulbe (Fulani, Peul). The Mandinka empire of Kaabu (Gabu) dated back to the thirteenth century and had been independent of old Mali since the sixteenth. The Fulbe had been in the area since at least the fifteenth century but had founded the Muslim state of Futa Jallon only after 1727.\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, Portuguese influence was in decline, but the clandestine slave trade was to continue for quite a time on both sides of the anti-slavery centre of Sierra Leone. Mandinka Kaabu had trouble maintaining its influence as far as the southern shores of the Gambia, and failed altogether with its former vassals the Ba'inuk, on the coast. The Foa (Balanta), non-centralized peasants, destroyed the Ba'inuk capital in 1830, and most of the survivors joined the Mandinka or else the Joola (Dyula), the hardy 'anarchic' traditionalist rice-growers who occupied the whole coastal area to the north. In the east, the Fulbe of Futa Jallon dominated the Mandinka as far as the Gambia in Kantora. In Kaabu and its dependencies, a Fulbe minority was growing increasingly impatient with its subordinate position.\nAt this period, the French set up trading posts in the Casamance, at Karabane in 1836 and then at Seeju (Sediou) in 1838.

The huge distances between settlements and towns - Johannesburg is 1540 km from Cape Town and the sparseness of the population had hitherto ruled out the construction of railways as a viable proposition. But the discovery of gold and diamonds made railways and roads not only necessary but also practical. It is not surprising then that railway construction began in the 1870s from different points - Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, East London and Durban - all leading first to the diamond fields and then after 1886 into the Transvaal. The length of railway line rose from no km by 1869 to 1700 km by 1889, 3300 km by 1899 and 4190 km by 1905 (see Fig. 16.4).$^{98}$ Side by side with railways went the construction of roads.

It was resisted in arms, and much of the support given to the great revolts of the early twentieth century which tried to redefine sovereignty came from men who hated forced labour.

If the two went hand to hand for Dahomey and Oyo, in Benin we had the formation of a strong state without such participation, and the inverse was true for the Niger delta. 36 The point, however, is a different one.

Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts. The extent to which popular discontent surfaced more frequently during the second half of the century suggests growing class antagonisms as did slave uprisings in Lozi society and on the prazos.""\nIn other instances trading interests, independent of the rulers, were able to dominate commerce and undercut the position of the political authorities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.624, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: North Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The economy of North Africa in the first quarter of the twentieth century did not develop at the same pace or pass through the same stages in all constituent countries (Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Libya, Egypt and Sudan), because they were not colonized at the same time (see Fig. 17. i).', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 16, 'article_title': 'Capabilities of Africa', 'full_section_title': 'Capabilities of Africa', 'last_edit_date': '10-14-1861', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_02_1862#article-16', 'issue_date': '22_02_1862', 'content': '4.

In the course of his observations on returning thanks, when his health had been drank, he thus explained what led to his late important expedition. It is well worthy attention. ""On my return to England, in 1867, the summary of reports by Speke, Grant, and myself amounted to this: Instead of the sterile desert hitherto shown upon the maps, Central Africa was a magnificent country, rising to a mean level of nearly 5,000 feet above the sea; from this elevated plateau mountains rose to various altitudes; the climate was healthy, the soil extremely fertile, the landscape resembled a beautiful English park, the rainfall extended over nine or ten months of the year, the country was well watered by numerous streams, the population was in many districts large, and where the slavers had not penetrated the natives were well-disposed. There were all the desiderata for a great forward movement. The Nile was navigable for large vessels as far as Gondokoro, 1,450 miles by river from Khartoum. The forests on the banks of the stream would supply fuel without expense for the steamers required. The supply of ivory appeared to be inexhaustible. Valuable fibres existed, and their preparation was understood by the natives. The highlands were specially adapted for coffee cultivation, while the lowlands were peculiarly suitable for cotton, which is now cultivated by the Shillook tribe in considerable quantities. There are portions of Africa (especially Fatiko, N. lat. 3 deg. 0.1 min.) that would form a terrestrial paradise. Unfortunately, this beautiful country was subject to a blight that had sprung from the Egyptian discovery of this land of promise. Under the pretence of trading in ivory, immense numbers of slave-hunters from the Soudan had organized themselves as piratical bands, to pillage the natives and to kidnap the women and children, to be sold in Khartoum as slaves. I do not think I exaggerate in estimating that fifty thousand slaves were carried down the Nile annually, closely packed in small vessels of about forty or fifty tons to the number of 250 or more on each ship. These miserable creatures were frequently attacked by severe epidemics, such as small-pox or typhus, which might kill half before their arrival at Khartoum. In case of an outbreak of disease, the sick were generally thrown overboard or landed on the pestilential marshes to starve. The drain upon the population was frightful. Countries that were once flourishing were depopulated. Worse than the physical suffering was the moral effect upon the natives. All confidence was destroyed by the repeated acts of treachery by the slave traders. Thus the natives became hostile and suspicious of all strangers. Cultivation was reduced to the smallest scale, as the natives feared to sow where they might not reap. It must be distinctly understood that the ""slave trade"" is a misnomer. There is no such thing as trade; but the slaves were kidnapped by night attacks upon unsuspecting villages, in which the men and old women were massacred and the young girls and children captured. The Viceroy of Egypt determined to suppress this crying evil. In this determination he was supported by the Prince of Wales, who took a lively interest in slave emancipation,"" &c., &c.'}, {'id': 3121, 'article_title': 'Lieut.

(Hear, hear.) I left England on the 30th of November, 1872, and went to Zanzibar with Sir Bartle Frere's mission. There were four of us—myself, Mr. Murphy, Dr. Dillon, and Mr. Moffatt, a nephew of Livingstone, who was too young for the hardships of the journey. After a great deal of difficulty in getting men, I started with my first caravan in company with Dr. Dillon in March, 1873, leaving Murphy and Moffatt behind. Moffatt unfortunately died before he rejoined us, but Murphy went on with us over countries travelled through before by Burton and Speke, and Stanley, to Ujanyembe. Here Dr. Dillon was taken ill and had to go back, and I had difficulties with some of the natives, who offered opposition. Let me say here that it was not with the better class of Arabs, whom I have found to be, in the best sense of the word, gentlemen. On Livingstone's body coming in, Dillon and Murphy went back with it, and I, after much delay, travelled by the same route as Burton and Stanley to Ujiji. There I met Arabs again, and received aid at their hands. I spent over two months then in surveying Tanganyika, and after rounding its southern end, I found out—what I had always believed there must be—an outlet on its western shore. Thence I went to Nyangwé, Livingstone's furthest, and found out that this outlet—the Lukuga—joined the Lualaba, which is really the head waters of the Congo. After in vain trying to get boats, I went with an Arab, Hemed-ib-Hamed, to his camp to try to work my way to Lake Sankarra, into which the Lualaba falls; but the chief on the opposite band of the Lomami refused me a passage. I then worked away to the south, to where I thought there were Portuguese traders, and the country of Kasongo, who is Chief of Urna, I found another Arab, Jumah-ibn-Salim, who was very kind to me. Here I fell in with a Portuguese subject named Aloiz, who said he was going direct to the Coast; but he was unreliable and delayed me more than six months. During that time I was able to visit one lake and to see another named Kussali, which is on one of the affluents of the Congo. I afterwards followed down the water-parting between the Zambesi and the Congo until I got into the Congo basin; and my examination enables me to say that they constitute one of the most magnificent systems of internal water communications in the world. Tanganyika and the Congo could be joined for the purposes of navigation by a canal 30 miles in length. The riches of the country are unspeakable, and I could not attempt to describe them now; but I am sure that the centre of Africa, especially on the west side of the Tanganyika, is destined one day to be the scene of civilization and productive trade.

One of the speakers suggested that as trade appears to be suffering from the fact that production exceeds consumption, it would be a good thing if capital was more systematically devoted to the work of distribution. We must conclude that some impulse to the distribution of wealth is needed; and a wider distribution of mercantile profits would doubtless be a consequence of the application of the joint-stock principle to mercantile enterprise.\n\nThere is a well-founded belief that the economic development of Africa will be a work of time, and that it is not at all likely to advance by ""leaps and bounds."" The fact is, that so far as the West Coast is concerned, experienced authorities have pointed out that the black man must be interested in cultivation if trade is to be permanent and African communities are to become large consumers of European manufactures. At the present rate of indiscriminate collection, the supplies of ivory must eventually be exhausted, the India-rubber and other plants be destroyed, and the whole country be converted into a waste. It is upon the interior that the interest of the trading and investing public is concentrated, because it is the region of untried possibilities. But the prudent ask whether, assuming the existence of vast stores of produce and favourable conditions of development and progress, markets can be found at paying prices for the produce which Central Africa may yield. It is a question of cost as well as of productiveness. African rivers are interrupted by cataracts from which the great rivers of other continents still only partially developed are free. It is true that the construction of railways is hinted at, but questions arise as to what will be the cost of such railways, who will provide the capital, how long before they become remunerative, and how many transhipments will be required; for it is conceivable that the mere cost of transporting produce to the consuming markets might prove greater than the price obtainable for them.'}, {'id': 5131, 'article_title': ""MR.

He waxes eloquent over the loveliness of the scenery, the extent of the forests, which contain ""the finest timber in the world,"" the gums and resins and palm oil exuding from the trees, the fish that swarm in the waters, the elephants whose tusks invite the truculence of the Shikari, the fat land teeming with vegetable riches, and ready to blossom with crops of sugar, cocoa, maize, cotton, or tobacco. Anything and everything will thrive on the soil of the Congo State which will grow in countries lying under the same latitude, while at the smallest estimate, there are at least thirty millions of people eager to buy the cottons and the cutlery, the crockery and the muskets, of the trader. The orchella weed drapes miles and miles of the primeval forest, and under the shadow of the tall trees are droves of elephants, lions, buffaloes, hippopotami, antelopes, water-bucks, lynxes, and other animals calculated to constitute this region the paradise of the sportsman.

There is a jay which has just fled into the woods. Look at those long-legged flamingoes at that spit of land; and—but the details are endless, for every minute of time has its incident."" Mr. Stanley has even a good word to say for the climate. He scorns the scandal which connects it with fevers and an early grave, and, take it all in all, there is less sickness by half in the Congo basin, even in its present unprepared condition, than there is in the ""bottom lands"" of Arkansas, a State which has doubled its population during the last twenty-five years. The further you go into the interior the better the country gets. The real heart of Equatorial Africa is this central fertile region, so different from the uplands of the maritime region, with their millions of ravines and narrow, oven-hot valleys and bald grass tops and limited bits of grassy plateaux, with here and there a grove of jungly forest scattered like islets amid the grassy wastes. This region is the kernel of the Continent; to this favoured land Mr. Stanley invites the capital and the enterprise of the European planter: and as new markets are opening up to them the natives are ceasing to regard the white man with the suspicion and dislike bestowed on him when first Mr. Stanley\'s Expedition began to break ground. All that is now required is a railway of fifty-two miles between Vivi and Isangila, and ninety-five miles between Manyanga and Leopoldville, in order that the cataracts which interrupt the three thousand miles of navigable river may be overcome.'}, {'id': 5184, 'article_title': ""MR.

The results of his journeys Mr. O\'Neill summarised as follows:—\n\n""Briefly, the chief results have been to open up three new routes between the Nyassa district and the coast: 1, between Mozambique and Lake Shirwa and Blantyre; 2, from Blantyre to the Portuguese settlements of Angoche and Parapato; 3, from Quillimane to Blantyre. You know the length of time it took to get overland to Lake Nyassa from the east coast. Many of you remember the hardships encountered by Bishop Steere when getting over the same ground. The Nyassa may now be reached by the longest route in thirty days, and by that from Quillimane to Blantyre in fourteen. The country you pass over is well-populated, food abundant, and the people peaceable, helpful, and industrious. There are difficulties of course, African travel is never without them; but any or all of the three routes I have laid down may be constantly traversed by Europeans, and become most valuable channels for the development of the trade and agriculture of the country. In my journeys I have been fortunate enough to discover three minor lakes: one, Lake Lidedi, just south of the Rovuma, and close to Lake Nargadi, of which Livingstone first heard as he passed north of that river upon his last travels. The others are Lake Amaramba and Cheuta, which have their outlet in the River Lujenda. When in the neighbourhood of these lakes I closely investigated the question of the supposed connexion of Lake Shirwa with the Lujenda drainage system, and satisfied myself that there was no point of junction between them. Lake Shirwa is divided from the Lakes Cheuta and Amaramba by a broad elevated ridge of sandy soil, lightly wooded and covered with thick undergrowth, and I have nowhere detected trace of inundation or evidence of the rising of Lake Shirwa above the level of its foot. It is possible that a subterranean junction exists, and this view is held by many natives.""\n\nMr. O\'Neill dwelt upon the importance of a reliable meridian in the interior for the traveller. He described the very interesting evidences of glacial action met with in the hilly regions, and stated he had never met with any traces of subsequent volcanic action, and that he doubts the hypotheses respecting volcanic disturbance. Remarking that though Eastern Africa has not the exuberant vegetation or magnificent forests of Brazil, the Congo region, and other parts of the world, Mr. O\'Neill added that the air is drier, there is less malaria, and the country is more fit for the residence of Europeans.'}, {'id': 5270, 'article_title': 'THE SOUTH-WEST COAST.', 'full_section_title': 'THE SOUTH-WEST COAST.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1885#article-10', 'issue_date': '01_12_1885', 'content': 'The coast-line from Cape Frio to the Orange river, the northern boundary of Cape Colony, was last year annexed by the German Government by a stroke of the pen, with the exception of the coast of Walfisch Bay, forty miles in extent, which had fortunately been annexed by the British Government as far back as 1878. This German territory has a coast-line 750 miles in extent, and is entirely inhabited by Damaraland Caffres and Namaqualand Hottentots. One fails to understand the object of the German Government in nominally taking possession of this enormous strip of coast-line. It is one of the most dangerous coasts in the world, beaten by a tremendous and unceasing surf, and throughout its entire extent landing is only practicable at about three places—viz., Sandwich Harbour, the somewhat notorious but practically valueless Angra Pequeña, and Walfisch Bay. The latter, which is undoubtedly the best harbour and most important place, as I have already said, is fortunately in our possession. Most of the coast-line is a sandy desolate waste, and it is only at Angra Pequeña and Walfisch Bay that settlements can possibly be formed. Even at these two there is no water procurable, and this necessary commodity has to be imported from Cape Colony at a heavy expense. The barren nature of the coast may be imagined from a notification which appears on a chart of the territory 800 miles north of Orange river: ""First tree seen here since leaving Cape Colony."" At present, not much is known of the interior. Damaraland is believed to be a rich and fertile country, but a desert intervenes between it and the coast-line. Strenuous efforts have been made to induce the British Government to annex Damaraland, as it is believed that the German Government have designs in that direction; but the Home Government declines at present to further increase either its territories or responsibilities in South Africa. When the Germans took possession of Angra Pequeña they made it a free port, while Walfisch Bay having been, when annexed, already covered with commerce, was not interfered with.\n\nconstituted an integral portion of the Cape Colony, had the same heavy export and import duties as that possession of ours chooses to levy. As a natural consequence, all the trade to and from the interior came to Angra Pequeña. I am glad however, to say that the Cape Parliament have seen the error of their way before it is too late, and have recently constituted Walfisch Bay a free port.

Upon the character of this region science has spent its speculations, and the exploration of it has been the hard work of ages. Africa, in fact, has been the world's huge problem. From Cæsar to Speke, the origin of the Nile has been mankind's greatest puzzle. Unsolved though it be, the attempts to trace it out have been of the greatest service. No longer esteemed a howling wilderness, or a death-stricken morass, the interior of Africa, from the southern border of Sahara down to our own limits, we know to be singularly fertile, and by no means insalubrious. The western shore, north of Walwisch Bay, gives ample evidence that a wealthy country lies beyond—a country rich in minerals and vegetation—blessed in all save the savage races that seal it up from the view of civilization. Going north, we find, near the equator, a tract of splendid hill-land, where the Cameroon Mountains reach to a height of 14,000 or 15,000 feet, and where the climate is so genial, that Captain Burton recommended its fitness for a penal settlement. Here we have come to the most remarkable part of the continent. Beyond the Cameroons extends that vast depression which intersects Africa, at a high altitude, from the equator to the Cape. Then, on the other side of the still unknown territory, we come to the wonderful lake-land, whose inland seas, fringed by the palm-growth of the tropics, are overshadowed by the snowy peaks, and embraced by the crescent arms of the mystic Mountains of the Moon. Here, in what may naturally be regarded as the hottest part of Africa, lying exactly across the equator, is a land which, according to Speke and Grant, is one of the finest in the world. Owing to its height above the sea-level, the climate is singularly pleasant, and is so far from being excessively hot, that Captain Grant walked through the whole of it in woollen clothing, and slept every night between blankets. 750 different specimens brought away by these travellers attest the abundance and variety of the vegetation there. All the necessaries and many luxuries of savage life grow without much effort, and the natives lead an easy and somewhat gluttonous existence, in the rank enjoyment of the many gifts of nature. From all we know, and that recent travellers have told us, the whole of East Africa, between Natal and the equator, bears the same character. Dr. Livingstone has found the cotton plant growing abundantly throughout the valleys and river plains north of the Zambezi. On this side of that river exists a country that is utterly unexplored as yet. On the map this region presents a blank, and a dotted line only marks the supposed course of the Limpopo as it goes to the sea. What is known of this tract, however, and by slow degrees it is being trenched upon, is altogether favourable. The large organised hunting stations which are now established in the Trans-Vaal, sending out yearly many detachments of trained hunters into the adjacent territories, are gradually opening up this darkly hid land, and we hear that recent hunters describe what they have seen of it in most glowing terms. They say that for beauty of aspect and natural fertility it exceeds any of the southern divisions, and the people of Moselekatsc, who rules as the emperor of it, are known to be in advance of the tribes on this side of them.

I rejoice in the success of Dr. Livingston, and of every other explorer and labourer in Africa; but much more need to be and can be done for her. 1. She needs missionaries and teachers, but these alone will not do the work needed. Accompanying them should be (2) farmers and mechanics, who can teach them civilization, for both must go together—civilization and Christianity: either without the other will fail; but both united will, with God's blessing, lift her up, and soon give her a place among the nations.\n\nShe has natural resources abundant. 1. The people are capable of being educated in the arts and sciences, in which they make rapid proficiency when an opportunity is provided. In managing business, mercantile or other, they manifest an ability equal to the whites. The richest men in Sierra Leone are negroes who were taken out of the slave ship. They make very efficient preachers, teachers, mechanics, farmers, &c., when instructed.\n\n2. The country is rich—very productive in many things needful for commerce and home consumption. Rice, Indian corn, and some smaller grains, suited to exportation, can be produced to any extent. Ginger, pepper, arrowroot, can be supplied to meet the wants of the world. Coffee and cotton of fine quality grow wild abundantly, and can be cultivated to any extent to supply Manchester and every cotton factory in Christendom. There only needs to do this to start it all along the Western Coast, and make a market for them, and the natives will go to producing them. They will work at what they can make the most money by. Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down. These things I have seen.\n\n3. And her minerals are rich and abundant. Gold and iron ore, the purest in the world, is very abundant in many parts.

England, France, Portugal, Germany, and Italy are attempting to obtain titles to the country. England has made annexation of the coast lying adjacent to her colony of Sierra Leone; France is forcing her way on the Senegal and toward the head-waters of the Niger; she threatens to annex the coast from the Gaboon to the Congo, some 250 miles, and is running her lines on the Upper Congo. Her Chamber of Deputies has granted the De Brazza mission, by a vote of 449 to 3, a credit of a million and a quarter of francs. The Portuguese Government has appointed explorers and examined the Congo country, and assumes to exercise control over all the territory at the mouth of the Congo. The German Reichstag has increased its annual appropriation for the exploration of Africa. Italy has despatched a party to Abyssinia for geographical and mercantile purposes. She has also concluded treaties which promise to make Assab a centre of commerce. The Sultan of Morocco has authorized Spain to take possession of Santa Cruz del Mar, and the Sultan of Zanzibar has purchased six superior steamers to constitute a regular coast service, in the interest of commerce and for the suppression of the slave-trade. The International African Association, which owes its origin to the philanthropic initiative of Leopold II., King of the Belgians, has received large subscriptions and pushed forward exploring expeditions to start and equip the line of hospitable and scientific stations which are to bound the East and West Coast, and form a civilizing girdle around Central Africa. And the results following the explorations of Livingstone and Stanley and De Brazza are attracting the attention of the civilized world. What was a \'Dark Continent,\' by the indomitable energy of these explorers, seems likely to prove the richest quarter of the globe. Not only does the land produce, with slight persuasion of tillage, admirable crops of cotton and coffee, but the soil is rich in diamonds on its southern coast, and in iron on its northern.

F. Scott Elliot. The lecture was followed with much interest as an exposition from an authority on the subject. Mr. Scott Elliot, by his recent visit to Ruwenzori, has afforded additional information about this magnificent range of mountains in Central Africa, and his treatment of the subject was graphic and most informing. The address was made the more interesting by a series of limelight views. After touching on the character of Africa generally, the lecturer proceeded to give an account of the mountain Ruwenzori, the various difficulties in climbing the primeval forest, its inhabitants, the bamboo zone, the peat mosses, and the various tribes round the mountain. The occurrence of recent volcanic craters, and the manner in which the cloud hangs over the mountain all day long, only disappearing about sunset, was fully illustrated by slides from photographs taken by the lecturer. The lecturer described his experiences. Leopards attacked his camp, and very nearly killed two of his porters. A woman was carried off by a lioness, and he vainly attempted to rescue her. Elephants were extremely abundant round the mountain. The Natives were usually friendly, though the difficulty of obtaining supplies was often considerable, and on one occasion three of his men were attacked by them, and one very severely wounded. His march to the South was one of extraordinary difficulty, as his caravan consisted only of fourteen men, and the people were in places extremely unfriendly, and on one occasion attacked his porters. The future value of these little-known regions was shown by him to depend mainly on three factors—First, the natural wild resources, as rubber, palm oil, minerals, and ivory; secondly, the prospects of plantation by Europeans; and thirdly, the health of Europeans. The country between 3,000 and 5,000 feet had been proved to be valuable for plantations of coffee and tobacco. It is only in Africa above 5,000 feet that there is any possibility of a real colony being formed. The lecturer expressed his opinion that with the knowledge we have now of these parts, the Masai Highlands certainly appear to be quite healthy enough for Europeans to live and bring up children; but that so far there is no sufficient inducement for colonisation at present. Then, turning to the needs of Great Britain at the present time, he suggested that the three main requisites at present were—first, that our imports of food and raw material should come from our own Colonies; secondly, new markets; and thirdly, an outlet for our capital and population, both of which were unnaturally locked up in Great Britain. These new countries were, according to him, exactly adapted to answer those three urgent necessities.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1896#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.637, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE GOLD MINES OF THE GOLD COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Although a long period has elapsed since the riches of this portion of West Africa have been known to Europeans, it is only in the last few years that the nature of its auriferous formations has been at all understood. Even now our knowledge of them is very imperfect, their thorough exploration being impeded by climatic and physiographic influences. In a country, of which the greater part of the surface consists of swamps overgrown with mangrove forests, and which is rendered impenetrable by the luxuriance of the vegetation, geological and geographical studies are rendered all but impossible, whilst the absence of mountains prevents the traveller from obtaining a clear idea of the general configuration. The surface of the country presents a series of flat swampy plains, copiously watered by rivers and streams, and intersected by chains of hills gradually increasing in elevation as we recede from the sea-coast towards the interior, the said chains of hills being, very roughly, parallel to the average trend of the coast. Having regard to the large annual rainfall (about 60 in.), to the exceeding softness of the rocks, and the great sinuosities of the river, as well as to the general surface contour, no geologist can doubt that we have here a well marked example of a low plateau, from which hills have been produced simply by subaerial denudation, the harder portions having resisted the influence of the aqueous action which has worn the softer parts into hollows and valleys. In many cases, the hills owe their existence to a quartz reef which they enclose, and which has formed the backbone of the hill; a confirmation of this theory may be found in the fact that the northern slope of the hills is usually far steeper than the southern, the enclosed reef dipping to the south. The country rock is in most cases a non-stratified and but slightly indurated clay rock, resting upon soft blue slates, at times schistose; but in the present imperfect state of our geological knowledge of this region this statement must be regarded as conjectural rather than conclusive. The writer has never himself seen a single fossil that might aid in fixing the geological epoch of this formation, nor has he ever heard of such having been found, and is disposed to regard it as modern, geologically speaking. Round the bases of these low hillocks, and covering some of the more elevated plains, are deposits of non-consolidated gravels which are occasionally auriferous. These have been and are worked by the natives, especially on the banks of the smaller streams, tributaries of the river Ancobra, which intersects and forms the main highway of communication between the various gold mining concessions and the coast. Hitherto, none of these auriferous deposits have been found sufficiently rich to repay the attention which various European explorers have directed towards them, though there is no reason why such should not be discovered, especially towards the interior. The main wealth of the region lies in its deposits of gold quartz, which have been and are now worked by various mining companies.

It is believed that the Greeks received gold from these parts 2,900 years ago. Of recent times our first African traveller, Mungo Park, proved the existence of gold north of the Kong Mountain, and described the methods by which gold was won by the Natives; a plan similar to that adopted by the Natives south of the same range. The present gold supply comes from Ashanti, and possibly the bulk of it from Wassau. A little over 40 years ago our principal supply came from the Gold Coast; but when California and Australia came to the front as gold producers, the Gold Coast was to a great extent lost sight of. Since the first supply of gold in 1471, the total amount received from West Africa has been estimated by Captain Burton at £600,000,000, an amount not in the least exaggerated, I should say, when we take into account the regular yearly returns made for a period exceeding 200 years. Other authorities estimate that in the space of 40 years no less an amount than £200,000,000 could have been received. The surface soil in some parts of the country seems to be full of gold; it has been found on the sea beach, in rivers, and even washed from the gutters of the streets of the small towns after rain. Rich mines are found in Gaman and Wassau, the principal gold fields being on the Wassau range. Expeditions have been made from time to time, and quite recently discoveries are reported from the north-west part of the Colony. Such work is slow; the country is covered with dense forest, which makes progress in travelling and surface examinations difficult. As there is traditionally great wealth in the Kong mountains, it would seem wise to construct a line of rails through the country with the object of tapping this region. We are met with the suggestion that it would be a worthless undertaking from the point of trade. This, however, is problematic. There is the conviction that gold obtains abundantly in the interior, which could be confirmed; that there is produce or a country capable of producing it is certain.', 'last_edit_date': '1893-09-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_09_1893#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'OPENING OF AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Mr. Donald Mackenzie, at the request of the Lord Mayor, then read a paper on the subject. He stated that the continent of Africa had an area of nearly a quarter of the entire land of the globe, and it had presented greater obstacles to human enterprise than any other part of the earth's surface. Notwithstanding the many explorations of scientific people and travellers, both recently and in ancient times, of which he quoted several instances, the vast interior of Africa still remained almost a terra incognita, with its natural wealth undeveloped, and its mineral treasures unexplored. It had a climate fully equal to any other part of the world, and capable of yielding tropical and subtropical productions to any extent. Still, it was a lost continent, banished, as it were, from commercial intercourse with the civilized parts of the world. The most considerable part of our commerce with North Central Africa was carried across the Great Desert of Sahara from the shores of the Mediterranean. Caravans now performed dangerous and tedious journeys of many months' duration from Morocco, Algiers, Tripoli, Tunis, and other ports to the kingdom of Soudan. Two thousand miles of sterile and mountainous country had to be traversed and hostile tribes encountered before the nearest market was reached. In spite of those difficulties, about three millions worth of British produce found its way annually from the North to Soudan, which kingdom had no less than twenty millions of inhabitants. The great importance of opening those regions to commerce could not for a moment be doubted, and Timbuctoo formed, he thought, the most favoured spot for such intercourse, situated as it was on the very edge of the Desert. His plan was to open a direct commercial highway from the mouth of the river Belta, in the neighbourhood of Capes Juby and Bogador, on the North-west Coast of Africa, opposite the Canary Islands, to the northern bend of the Niger, at Timbuctoo—a distance of about 800 miles. That would form the shortest route to the interior, and was within easy access of Europe and America, the mouth of the Belta being distant about 1,500 miles from England. The engineering difficulties were inconsiderable, since the physical formation of that part of the Desert of Sahara which had to be crossed favoured the project; a great tract of it, with an area of 126,000 square miles, and known as Eljuf, being a vast depression, considerably below the level of the Atlantic. It was bounded by fertile and populous regions, and inhabited by an industrious class of people, whose only commercial intercourse with Europe was carried on from Mogador. That depression was impregnated with salt, and it had, it was believed, formerly formed part of the bed of the sea. He contended that the climate, the geography, and the people were all favourable to the scheme, and if once the mouth of the Belta was cleared of sand, the waters of the Atlantic would fill their former bed; thus establishing a direct communication with North Central Africa within easy distance of our ports. Instead of a trade of three millions annually, it might be increased tenfold. The great continent of Africa would be opened to every wholesome influence, its vast resources would be developed, and the horrors of the slave-trade would no longer stain its history. He added that the proposed preliminary survey would enable them to obtain the necessary data to carry out the scheme, and that such survey would be comparatively inexpensive."", 'last_edit_date': '1875-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1875#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.625, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICAN PRODUCTS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I have often thought of giving you a short notice on this most important subject, which lies necessarily at the very root of African improvement, and consequent civilization. Circumstances have hitherto prevented my doing so, and I should perhaps have deferred writing about it at present, from the conviction that the materials at my command are insufficient to enable me to give you a report such as a matter of so great importance demands. Considering, however, that you have always more articles for your valuable journal than your space will allow you to publish, I shall try to give you multum in parvo. It has been one of the great aims of the African Times, from its formation, to point out to the rising generation of Africa the fact, that the great wealth of a country depends upon the amount of its agricultural products; and that the immense riches of Africa can never be developed unless its people put their shoulders to the wheel, and perform their part. You have seized upon every occasion to point out the immense advantages to be derived from a systematic pursuit of agriculture, and you have also particularised important and fertile soils at points which might be taken as nuclei, for operation. For instance, you have thus singled out Quiah, at Sierra Leone; the interior countries of the Gold Coast; the lands on the banks of the several rivers on the country of Yoruba, as well as those of the Niger, the mother river of Western Africa, and the great high road to its central territories. At Sierra Leone, the yearly burning of its fields; the excessive amount of iron in the composition of its soil—especially the Peroxide; the practice of upturning that soil yearly from the time of the formation of the colony for sowing purposes, without any external assistance by manure; the imperfect knowledge of the science of agriculture and of chemistry by the farmers, which teaches that the difference in the inorganic ingredients of plants leads them to select different inorganic materials from the soil, and therefore that rotation of crops is essential where manures cannot be obtained—have led its soil to be rightly pronounced as not the most fit for agricultural pursuits. It is therefore highly pleasing to find that his Excellency Governor Blackall is using his influence to popularise the subject amongst the young men of Sierra Leone, and to point out to them the fertile region of Quiah. The lecture lately delivered by the Rev. George Nicol, on the agriculture of that colony, ought to be regarded as a vade mecum for every one. The lands bordering the sea on the Gold Coast are dry and arid, and contain throughout the year but very little moisture. They are rich in phosphate and other inorganic matters, but the uncertainty of rain consequent on the geographic position of the lands forms, in the absence of irrigation, a great barrier to planters. It is to the interior we must therefore look for a field of effectual agricultural operations. The inhabitants of the Eastern Districts, through the indefatigable exertions of the Basle missionaries and Mr. Freeman, are now becoming alive to the advantages of agriculture, and every man of consequence is devoting the best portion of his time to it. In the interior of Cape Coast, or the central portion of the Gold Coast Government, the soil is admirably adapted for sowing any kind of crops. The best is to be found in the regions bordering on the Ashantee frontiers or that of the Fanti. It is there excellent for almost every kind of vegetable, and is rich in inorganic ingredients. It is an argillaceous superficial loam, intermixed with a species of sand formed by the disintegration of quartzose and felspathic rocks. The river communication should make this part the fulcrum for agricultural pursuits. It is needless for me to say a word on the fertility of the Yoruba and Niger soils, as all history goes to prove that they are rich in productive materials.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1864#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Future of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dr. Karl Peters, on March 5, delivered a lecture on ""The Future of Africa,"" before a meeting of the Foreign Press Association, held at the Society of Arts, Adelphi, London.

There were large and mighty rivers, whose alluvial tracts made the cultivation of all kinds of tropical vegetation possible. There were not wanting direct inducements for immigration such as were offered to the white man\'s imagination by the existence of precious metals and precious stones, and a later generation of colonists would be able to use throughout the entire continent, from north to south, iron for their immediate wants, and in many districts coal required by modern industry. A modern traveller had truly said that ""the greatest treasure of Africa consists in the inexhaustible labour force of its inhabitants."" The Native population, which was estimated at about 200 millions, only required to be organised by the whites in order to raise the natural wealth of the continent. A sound connexion of justice with proper severity towards the blacks was the correct principle of conduct to act upon. Africa required railways and highways in every part for the purpose of its economic development and civilisation. Rinderpest must be exterminated.

The fact is that generations must pass before the country can be properly developed. We are not dealing with a country in which there are accumulated wealth, acquired habits of industry, and a knowledge of art, but with peoples who are absolutely ignorant. There is potential wealth in the land, but it must be cultivated. At present no trade is done except in forest products.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

104,African societies have demonstrated resilience and adaptability by preserving and transforming cultural identities and traditions despite historical and external challenges.,"The observations from both the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the resilience and adaptability of African societies in preserving and transforming their cultural identities and traditions despite historical and external challenges. The textbook highlights how African cultures have adeptly blended retention and adaptation in response to Western innovations, as evidenced by the coexistence of indigenous and European traditions in architecture, religion, and social customs. Examples such as the Igbo's simultaneous embrace of holy communion and traditional practices, and the Nguni's integration of Christian and traditional rites, illustrate this adaptability. The resilience of African cultural forms in the face of colonialism is noted, with changes often being additive rather than substitutive, and African art, music, and dance regaining prominence. Additionally, African societies used religion as a tool of resistance against colonial rule, with syncretism allowing for the coexistence of African and European religious practices. The persistence of African cultural values in the Americas, despite the disruptions of slavery and colonialism, further underscores this resilience. Complementing these insights, The African Times articles highlight initiatives like the ""Workmen's Club"" in Gambia, which addressed economic challenges through community-based solutions, and the craftsmanship of gold trinkets on the Gold Coast, which preserved indigenous skills despite external influences. The articles also discuss the Wanika tribes adopting industrial habits and the spread of Islam, illustrating dynamic cultural transformations in response to changing circumstances. However, they also acknowledge challenges such as the influence of European traders and the introduction of demoralizing commodities. Together, these sources affirm the enduring and transformative nature of African cultural identities amidst various challenges.","The paragraphs from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook provide substantial support for the claim that African societies have demonstrated resilience and adaptability by preserving and transforming cultural identities and traditions despite historical and external challenges.

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure.

African dance, art, music and traditional religious systems held their own and such borrowings and adaptations as were made by Africans were not only selective but also, to borrow M. J. Herskovits' terminology, 'additive' and not necessarily 'substitutive'. 56 Thus, in the rural areas and even to some extent in the urban ones, new beliefs, new gods, new utensils, new artefacts and new objects were added to the old ones. Certainly, in these areas, many Christians did and still do retain their belief in their traditional gods. Indeed, in the field of religion, if anything, it was the European religion that was rather Africanized as is obvious from the rituals, hymns, music and even doctrines of some of the syncretic and millenarian churches and not the other way round. What is even more important, the ground that was lost even in the urban centres in the field of culture has virtually been regained.

The values of the two religions interpenetrate in varying degrees. In Brazil, for instance, a series of Catholic sacraments, such as baptism, are repeated not only for ritualistic purposes but also to give the individual additional strength.

In Haiti, for example, where the black population is in the majority, a characteristically African religion was influenced by the structural realities of Haitian society and the role of the half-castes, and underwent a series of changes set in motion by new \'gods\' that met the requirements of the new situation. In the neighbouring islands, as a result of Protestant mission work, a \'black culture\' had already taken shape in various movements such as that of the Rastafarians (a Messianic wave of reaction against the white overlord in which African imagery was thinly veiled, Haile Sellassie being cast as Messiah). On the other hand, in Jamaica, with the Sasabonsan cult, of Asante origin, elements of \'African culture\' persisted during that historical period, subsequently vanishing to give way to spirit-based cults involving a large dose of magic, as was the case in 1894 of the \'Jamaica Baptist Free Church\', a sect founded by Bed ward.\nIn those parts of the Americas exposed to the teachings of Catholicism, a form of syncretism based on the co-existence of European and African cultural features arose.

This approach was used by Octavio Ianni and Fernando Henrique Cardoso$^{69}$ to study the process by which former slaves entered the free labour market and, subsequently, their integration into the urban economy.\nThis type of analysis makes it possible to evaluate the extent to which the population of African origin is integrated in the economic systems and societies of South America. However, it leaves on one side the continuing prestige of African cultural values in the New World, although of course one may hold the view that this can only be measured by using a racial criterion or that it is not an important variable.\nHere there are two conflicting schools of thought. The position taken by M. J. Herskovits$^{70}$ regarding the 'reinterpretation' of African culture as reflected in continuing cultural elements, provoked the black North American sociologist, E. Franklin Frazier$^{7}$ ' to draw attention to the central problem of integration in society as a whole. As Frazier saw it, Herskovits' theory could lead to the conclusion that the persistence of African cultural values might be regarded as evidence supporting the racialist argument that blacks cannot be assimilated. In the United States, on account of various factors including the work of the Protestant churches, the former slaves lost most of their traditional African cultural values and became part of the Anglo-Saxon cultural world.\nThe parallel between North America and South America and the Caribbean in terms of the African presence and particularly of African cultural values is not conclusive, for the situations were very different in view of the different ways in which the former slaves became 'integrated' in those regions, even from one country to another.\nFrom the cultural standpoint, whereas in the United States conversion to the Protestant religion led to the forsaking of cultural traditions and to the emergence of a new outlook, in Latin America and the Caribbean African cultural values persisted to varying degrees or underwent a process of transformation.\nMethodologically, two forms of presence should be distinguished: the cultural presence of Africa and the Negro presence in the physical sense.

Cre› ativity became especially necessary where a small number of Europeans lived among a large number of Africans as was the case in many colonies of exploitation such as Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Saint-Domingue.

Maroon towns existed for equally long periods in Esmeraldas in Ecuador and in parts of the Blue Mountains and the Cockpit Country of Jamaica.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

Later on, in Suriname, French Guiana and, to a certain extent, in Jamaica, they held themselves aloof from what could be called the 'national community'.\nFrom the demographic standpoint, the composition of the population of each country should be carefully checked with reference to three main groups: the population of African origin, that of European origin and, lastly, that of local origin - the 'Amerindians'.

Some, it is true, resisted fairly well ... But many other state societies collapsed on impact with the Europeans ...

Amongst those who witnessed the trial were several gentlemen of experience and high standing in the mining world.\n\nThe material operated on was tin stuff from the Clitters Mine, and mundic from the Queen Mine. The mill introduces an entirely new system, and for the size of the machine has a very great output. One of the great claims made in its favour being its simplicity in construction, and a very small cost for renewals. The mill consists simply of two shafts and a casing. On the inner end of each shaft is a cast iron cup, which revolves at a high speed, and just projects inside the casing. The cups give the motion to the material, which is constantly thrown out of each cup with such great force that the collision caused by the rock thrown from the one cup with the rock thrown from the other cup immediately reduces the material, and consequently the wear which usually takes place in ordinary reducing machines is transferred to the material itself.\n\nGreat interest was taken in this trial, as various mills have previously been tried in the district; but all have failed to do their work satisfactorily; and the old Cornish stamp, with its many working parts, is, up to the present, looked upon as the only suitable and workable machine.\n\nThe mill used on this occasion was one of the 12"" size, and the result of the trials showed that the average output on tin stuff was 2 tons per hour, which is equal to the output obtained from a Cornish stamp battery with forty-eight heads. The mill put through 4½ tons of mundic per hour. The result was looked upon as highly satisfactory, and the general opinion was that it was the only mill which had been tried in the district which had turned its work out in a satisfactory way. It is admirably suited for mines situated some distance from the coast, as its weight is so small.\n\nOn gold quartz, one of these mills turning out the same quantity of work, and using the same power, is only one quarter the weight of a stamp battery, which will show a great saving in cost where all the machinery has to be carried for hundreds of miles on the back of mules. The saving in the cost of repairs also amounts to a considerable sum in the year.\n\nThe general feeling expressed was that there was a large field open for such a machine, and that it would take a very prominent position in the future.

Mr. Woodall, replying for the War Office, declared that their position with respect to small arms ammunition was one of a very satisfactory nature. The figures in the estimates were smaller because the prices of various articles used in manufacture had diminished. The factory at Waltham had been reconstructed, and a larger amount of ammunition could be produced than formerly. Colonel Lockwood challenged the Government to substitute facts for vague and general assertions. Mr. Campbell-Bannerman, the Secretary for War, said the Adjutant-General had pronounced the department to be in a perfectly sound position on the figures which he now held in his hands. The reserves of cordite had been steadily increasing; they were more considerable this year than last, and would be still better next year. As against the contention that this country could not put into the field a single army corps, he stated that we could mobilise three army corps, amounting to 110,000 men. There would be also 171,000 men available for garrison service, and ammunition for the whole of this force was provided. He hoped that this would suffice to relieve the great tension of anxiety which existed.—Mr. Balfour said he did not regard the statement of the right hon. gentleman as any more satisfactory than that which had gone before. Why, when all the facts had been given about the number of men, &c., the line of secrecy should be drawn at cartridges, he did not know.—Mr. Chamberlain pointed out that the figures which the Government had furnished showed that this country now possessed, roughly speaking, 100,000,000 cartridges, or 600,000,000 less small-arms ammunition than the Japanese when they went to war with China.—Colonel Kenyon Slaney insisted that the position in which the country had thus been left was absolutely perilous.—Mr. Woodall enlarged upon the excellence of the contracts entered into by the department, but Mr. Goschen, drawing a distinction between real ""reserve"" and due ""equipment,"" showed that the case for the Government was rapidly dropping from bad to worse. The Committee thereupon divided, and the division list showed that the ""Ayes"" had mustered 132 as against 125 for the ""Noes""—a majority of 7 against the Government.

The right honourable gentleman and yourself may not fully comprehend the meaning of this important point in the memorial, and be led to inquire what are the good effects which have been produced by those societies. I will explain. Between 1837 and 1841 the sitting magistrates at the Gambia were wearied with one complaint and one plea throughout the rainy seasons, when business is half closed, and no employment can be found for the lower class of workmen, such as labourers, &c. These men must live, and when they could not obtain their living honestly, they procured it by dishonesty, going about stealing from the merchants\' stores, &c., and when taken before the magistrates they pleaded not guilty, giving as their poor, groundless reason, ""that they were in want, and, having nothing to live upon, as there was no work to do in the rains, and no merchant willing to give them credit, they were obliged to rob."" The magistrates then saw the real wants of the people, and consulted a Wesleyan missionary (now in England) to see if he could manage some means of restraining those lawless characters. The rev. gentleman then called on one of his local brethren to see what could be done. They concluded to form a ""Workmen\'s Club"" for assisting each other throughout the rains. The local brother mustered the whole of his tribe and explained to them in their own language the shame and disgrace some had brought on themselves, &c. He then showed them the necessity for a Workmen\'s Club, for assisting each other in time of need. The proposal was unanimously voted; and thus the first Eboe society started in the year 1842. It consisted of both males and females, and up to this day a male member pays 1s., and a female 6d. per month. At the close of every meeting the members were warned to be honest, and informed that should they require any necessary assistance the club will be ready to meet their wants. In the course of two years the practices complained of were totally forgotten. People became honest and respectful, other tribes following their example, until all the various tribes in the Gambia formed themselves into similar societies with similar objects. It succeeded so well that the magistrates and merchants returned their thanks to the rev. gentleman for his kind suggestion to the people. The people are also, to this day, grateful to him and to his local brother, their own countryman, whose son is now in London, sent by his countrymen to study for their further welfare.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-12-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1865#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.558, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Genius of Native Africans; Their Contributions to the Centennial Exhibition', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Allow me space in your valuable columns to set aright an erroneous mistake. An editor informed me that a friend of his who visited the Centennial advised him that he saw the gold trinkets from the Gold Coast, but he was told that those trinkets were made by the white settlers on the Gold Coast. I beg to deny this assertion _in toto_. In the first place, there are no white settlers on the West Coast of Africa, beginning from ""St. Mary\'s Bathurst, Gambia,"" to ""St. Paul de Loanda."" The few Europeans and Americans on that Coast are either Government officials, missionaries, or merchants. The large assortment of gold trinkets that are in the main building at the Centennial are as follows: Gold ear-rings, gold drops, gold bracelets, of various designs; gold hair-combs, gold crosses, gold brooches, in shapes of butterflies and other designs; gold rings, with the twelve signs of the Zodiac and numerous other designs; gold beads, gold studs, gold links, gold chains, gold necklaces, gold guards, gold dust, and other gold trinkets too numerous to mention; and these gold trinkets were made by the native Africans, some of whom cannot speak a word of the English language. In style of workmanship these trinkets are unequalled by anything made by civilized craftsmen the world over. Certainly there is nothing in this line in the Centennial that may be placed beside them; and when it is considered that they were wrought with rude tools, that the artizans were native men, unskilled in civilized art; that they and their fathers from time immemorial have ever lived on the Gold Coast, that they are the manufacturers of the largest assortment of trinkets in the Centennial,—then it seems to me that these men,—the ""Ashantees,"" the ""Accras,"" the ""Fantees,"" the ""Denkras,"" the ""Wassaws,"" the ""Assins,"" &c.,—should not be deprived of the meed of praise which belongs to them, but should receive the just reward for their great genius and their native art. I therefore, as an African, of which I am proud, having been born, bred and educated on that Coast, feel called upon to make this explanation. On several occasions while visiting the Centennial, I spent some time in explaining to the ladies and gentlemen who crowded around me that these trinkets were made by the native Africans, and I took great pains to impress upon their minds the capability and ingenuity of the native Africans. I would like very much that the words West Africa should be placed under the words Gold Coast, for many persons will think that the Gold Coast is in Australia or California, and thus deprive Africa of her just merits.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.568, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Tribute to African Times', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'From a distinguished Christian labourer in Africa: ""From a twenty years\' African experience, I know some of the difficulties that beset your path in advocating the interests of Africa, and in seeking to promote the amelioration of her millions of inhabitants; but your path is that of truth and justice, which has prevailed, and will prevail, in doing good at home and abroad; therefore, take courage, and go on in the good work.""', 'last_edit_date': '1864-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1864#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.575, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MAHOMEDANISM IN AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The progress of Islam forms the subject of an interesting article in the current number of *Fraser*, entitled ""Mahomedanism and the Negro Race,"" written, as we are informed in an editorial note, by Mr. Edward W.

Mr. Blyden dwells particularly upon the superiority in manliness, self-reliance, and general moral tone of Mahomedan negroes over those of their race who have embraced Christianity. For this superiority—which, he says, all observers are compelled, however reluctantly, to admit—he assigns several causes, one of which is striking and suggestive. ""The Mahomedan negro,"" he says, ""has not been exposed to the depressing influence of Aryan art."" To the negro ""the painting and sculpture of Europe, as instruments of education, have been worse than failures. They have really raised barriers in the way of his normal development.""

There is much independent testimony to the same effect. Professor Crummel, in his book on ""The Future of Africa,"" asserts ""Mohammedanism is rapidly and peaceably spreading through all the tribes of Western Africa."" Sir Richard Burton affirms that ""Mohammedans alone make proselytes in Africa."" Dr. Blyden, a full-blooded Christian negro, recently the Liberian Minister at the Court of St. James, is an unexceptional witness. In his recent work entitled ""Christianity, Islam, and the Negro Race,"" he says that in Western Africa ""Mohammedanism is rapidly superseding Paganism. The Arab missionaries in the interior go about without purse or scrip, and disseminate their religion by quietly teaching the Koran. In this way, silently and unobtrusively, they are causing princes to become obedient disciples and zealous propagators of Islam."" These Moslem missionaries go from town to town and village to village, simply as the bearers of God\'s truth. They take their mats or their skins and their manuscripts, and are followed by their pupils, who in every new Pagan town form the nucleus of a school and congregation. These preachers are the receivers, not the dispensers, of charity. In the interior missionaries are to be met from Kairwan, Cairo, Morocco, dependent for their food upon those whom they instructed. As to the results of this noiseless propaganda of these devoted men, Professor Blyden tell us that ""between Sierra Leone and Egypt the Mohammedans are the only great intellectual, moral, and commercial power. . . . Islam has taken possession of and shaped the social, political, and religious life of the most intelligent tribes. . . . No one can travel any distance in the interior without finding that Islam is the ruling influence."" ""From Senegal to Lagos, over 2,000 miles, there is scarcely an important town where there are not at least one mosque and active representatives of Islam."" ""Throughout Mohammedan Africa education is compulsory. A man might now travel across the Continent from Sierra Leone to Cairo, or in another direction from Lagos to Tripoli, sleeping in a village every night, except in the Sahara, and in every village he would find a school."" The statements of Mr. Bosworth Smith are to the same effect. He says, ""At this day Mohammedan missionaries are meeting everywhere with a marked success which is denied our own."" ""We hear of whole tribes laying aside their Devil worship, or immemorial fetish, and springing at a bound, as it were, from the very lowest to one of the highest forms of religious belief.""', 'last_edit_date': '1887-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1887#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.558, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ancient Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'hair of Buddha belong to the black race, and Nahsi is the negro name.

The walls of their dwellings are rarely, if ever, whitewashed, and are often crowded, ill-ventilated, and dirty. Most of the rooms are miserably small, dark, damp, and badly ventilated, especially those devoted to sleep. In their sleeping places the poorer classes, and many persons in better circumstances, keep all the dirty clothing not in wear either about their beds or hanging from the wall, scraps of food and putrid fish being strewed about or collected in corners. The lower rooms open into inner courts, where, in fine weather, the members of the several families meet, and where they often cook and eat their food. The houses of what may be termed the middling class are well furnished with European articles of cabinet furniture, with crockery, glass, and mirrors, while the walls are decorated with cheap prints. The wealthy native gentlemen (living in the seaboard towns) live in well-built houses, commodiously, and often elegantly, furnished; but few of them have fireplaces in the public rooms or bedrooms—a want which impairs health in a country exposed to heavy night-dews, and in some wet seasons to heavy falls of rain.

In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies.

Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary.

The extent to which popular discontent surfaced more frequently during the second half of the century suggests growing class antagonisms as did slave uprisings in Lozi society and on the prazos.""\nIn other instances trading interests, independent of the rulers, were able to dominate commerce and undercut the position of the political authorities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Only few of the colonial administrators seemed to have understood how to manage the uneasy relationship which existed between the 'traditional' and the new African elites on the one hand, and between these two sets of elites and the colonial regimes on the other.

It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

Such a rivalry occurred in the kingdom of Wagadugu, where Mogho Naaba Karfo (1842-9) decided to distribute to the poor among the common people the property that he had confiscated from the wealthy. In dispensing justice, he was accessible to noble and commoner alike. It is highly likely that this social policy was a factor in the great rebellion of the princes that broke out in his reign at the instigation of the most important of his ministers, the Widi Naaba.\nLastly, we may mention the coastal lands, where the driving forces of trade and education were producing a qualitatively new type of social stratification. Once the basis of commercial activity had shifted from the slave trade to the exchange of palm oil, rubber, ivory and gold for European products, a new merchant class emerged, operating with stocks of trade goods advanced by European companies, whose agents they actually were. Thus began the careers of a number of great merchants with establishments in the coastal centres. At a lower level, swarms of petty dealers who played the role of door-to-door salesmen to the suppliers gravitated around the great merchants, on whom they were dependent.$^{62}$ The Asante merchants who, for their part, controlled the supply of products from the interior of Africa, namely the akonkofo, also constituted a factor to be reckoned with. 63 In much the same way, in the field of education new categories, or even entire social classes, came into being along the coast. At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone. These people were regarded as 'English gentlemen', and behaved accordingly. They were accepted in European circles and rose to positions of responsibility as magistrates, commanders of forts and the like.

In Bunafu, not only was there a sense of government and authority, some of the migrants came with traditions of structured hierarchical political systems from which they were fleeing, but which they still drew upon in the rivalries that accompanied the emergence of a new authority system in Bunafu. Others also carried with them belief in the power of a the mukama, a charismatic prince chosen and possessed by the god, or the efficacy of ritual firelighting from royal hearths, to affect fertility and harvests. As Vellut has argued, instead of the state-stateless dichotomy, we should think of two modes of power structures: the hierarchical, well-defined order based on the payment of tribute which was that of the kingdoms; and, at the other extreme, the more egalitarian and informal type of government by councils of elders and notables."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Conclusion', 'content': ""By the first decade of the twentieth century there were practically no indigenous sovereign states in Southern Africa.

A switch meant changing old trade habits and methods, and dealing with a new set of white traders.

Those African rulers who have been mistakenly termed collaborators were those who thought that the best way of safeguarding their sovereignty or even regaining the sovereignty that they might have lost to some African power previous to the arrival of the Europeans was not to collaborate but rather to ally with the European invaders. A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation.

Cutting across the lineage system of non-centralized societies, a variety of integrative institutions developed in the religious, judicial and economic fields which could function as an overall framework of order or replace a disintegrating state-system.$^{25}$ The poro and similar associations in Upper Guinea, or various so-called 'secret societies' in the Cross river and equatorial forest areas of the Cameroons and Gabon are examples.

The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > The African dimension theory', 'content': 'In these cases an explanation of partition will need to emphasise external pressures, such as mercantile demands and Anglo-French rivalries.

He sees the partition and con› quest as the logical consequence of European nibbling at Africa which started well before the nineteenth century; he accepts that the essentially economic impulse that necessitated that nibbling changed drastically during the last quarter of the nineteenth century; that the change was caused by the transition from slave to legitimate trade and the subsequent decline in both the export and import trade during that period, and that it was this economic change in Africa and the consequent African resistance to increasing European influence that precipitated the actual military con› quest.

Contrary to general belief, such an approach is no ingenious discovery of the 'new' African historiography. J. S. Keltie's remarkable book, The Partition of Africa,$^{27}$ published in 1893, does note perceptively that the Scramble of the 1880s was the logical consequence of the nibbling at the continent which started some 300 years ago. It also gives a nodding acceptance to the view that the partition was economic› ally motivated although that is not its central argument. In the 1930s, George Hardy, the prolific French colonial historian, also demonstrated the local African dimensions of the partition, and he treated Africa very much as a historical unity. Like Keltie, he argues that although the immediate cause of partition was the economic rivalry of the countries of industrial Europe, it was at the same time an important phase in the longstanding contact between Europe and Africa. He suggests that African resistance to increasing European influence precipitated the actual conquest just as the increasing commercial rivalry of the industrialized nations led to the partition. 28 For a long time such views of the partition were ignored. But with the publication in 1956 of K. Onwuka Dike's classic Trade and Politics in the Niger Delta,$^{29}$ the African dimension of the partition was resurrected. Although Dike's book is limited in its time span and geographical range, it nevertheless encouraged a generation of historians to begin to treat the partition in the context of a long period of contact of different races and cultures. Unfortunately, while Roland Oliver and J. D. Fage demonstrate this extended relationship in their very popular Short History of Africa, 30 they still emphasize the European rather than the African dimension of the partition. It is therefore refreshing that A. G. Hopkins' important study,$^{31}$ although limited in its geographical scope, should attempt an African-oriented reinterpretation of imperialism in West Africa. His con› clusion is worth quoting: At one extreme it is possible to conceive of areas where the transition from the slave trade was made successfully, where incomes were main› tained, and where internal tensions were controlled. In these cases an explanation of partition will need to emphasise external pressures, such as mercantile demands and Anglo-French rivalries.

Yet it has proved extremely difficult in practice to discuss resistance within this chronological limitation. At one extreme I have discussed Makana, the Xhosa prophet of the early nineteenth century. At the other extreme I have discussed the Zambezi rising of 1917 and its links with FRELIMO. But at least I have so far limited discussion to armed resistance to white invasion or to armed uprisings against colonial rule as it began to 'bite'; the chronological extensions arise from the uneven nature of white advance into Africa and from the still more uneven establish› ment of effective colonial control. Using this essentially political definition the period between 1880 and 1900 emerges as a crucial period of resistance, even if many of the great attempts to redefine sovereignty through protest took place later.\nIf we now turn in conclusion to the developing emphasis on economic resistance, the chronological limits become even less clearly defined. Perhaps the most radical reinterpretation is that of Samir Amin. Amin argues that the really crucial West African resistances to Europe came in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and he dismisses the resist› ances of the Scramble period itself as the half-hearted, rearguard actions of an already compromised ruling class. In Amin's eyes what was essentially at stake in the confrontation between Africa and Europe was not formal political control but Europe's attempts at economic manipulation. The truly significant African resistance was directed against such economic manipu› lation.\nAmin argues that the trade across the Sahara had 'strengthened state centralization and stimulated progress'. The European-controlled Atlantic trade, on the other hand, 'did not give rise to any productive forces: on the contrary, this caused a disintegration of society ... African societies obviously opposed this worsening of their situation, and Islam served as the basis for their resistance ... The Muslim priests tried to organize a resistance movement; their aim was to stop the slave trade, i.e. the export of the labour force, but not to end internal slavery ...

Contrary to the common belief, the history of the years 1800-80 is not a matter only or mainly of long-distance trade and links with the outside world (the economy of Central African communities at this period was still based more on production than on trade). Nor can the precolonial nineteenth century be regarded as an era of widespread violence, because of the slave trade, civil strife, etc.: the commonplace belief that Africa was racked by incessant 'tribal warfare' overlooks the basic fact that the bulk of the peoples in the area led peaceful lives as producers, steadily improving their farming methods, bettering their environment and exporting the produce of food-gathering. Finally, the history of the nineteenth century is not to be reduced to purely political history concerned with despotic kingdoms and states: if there is a political feature common to the Central African communities of the period around 1800, it is more likely to be the much disputed quest for equilibrium and accommodation between powers derived from different sources.\nAn historical account of nineteenth-century Central Africa must in fact satisfy several requirements. It must describe the ordinary life and aspirations of the societies in this enormous area at the time. This would bring out the continuity between the 1800s and the more distant past: the changes, although noticeable, were slow.\nAt the same time, the history of Central Africa in the nineteenth century is characterized by breaks with the past. After all, in the years 1800-80 the area was more a part of the world trading network than ever before. The impact of the world economic situation, or of some specific sectors of it, was making itself felt: in some areas it influenced social and political history, giving a noticeable impetus to trade and offering new opportunities for stockpiling, while in others it restricted the process.

The very words which issue from his own pen bear testimony to the fact that he cannot have had any acquaintance with West African *kings*. Quaku Duah and Badahung are the only *kings* that we know of in these parts, and they are not only able to, but they *do*, effect anything and everything that they please (humanly speaking, of course), without consulting anybody.\n\nThe King of Ashantee has absolute authority over *everybody and everything* in his kingdom, and he exercises it to the very utmost extent at all times, without asking the advice or the consent of a soul, not even of the ""soul"" that ""An African"" makes such a fuss about.

About the period that the Rev. William West, the superintendent of the Wesleyan Mission on the Gold Coast, was at Coomassie on a visit to the King, in company with the Rev. John Osco Ansah (an Ashantee prince) and Mr. Ghartey, a report was brought to his Majesty that a woman in a neighbouring village had made use of his great oath without sufficient cause. Quaku Duah at once despatched his executioner with his staff to the said village with orders (I need not say *strict or positive orders*, as in Coomassie all orders are positive and irrevocable) to slay every man, woman, child, sheep, goat, dog, fowl, and living creature therein, and to raze the place to the ground, and scatter salt over the ruins. *These orders were executed literally.* For the truth of this I refer to the three gentlemen named above.

We have read it attentively, but we cannot find in it that dependable rectification of errors in King Weah’s statement, published by us last month, which we had looked for. Having received constant and minute intelligence from Cape Palmas, from the period of the advent of the Liberian Commissioner there, we discover that there are important omissions in the Report; nor are we at all satisfied that King Weah’s statements are incorrect as regards either of the two great points—viz., the commencement of warlike operations and the territorial claims. We are surprised at the failure of the Report on these points, because, if there be one thing more than another in which the public men in Liberia have excelled, it has been in the drawing up of their Reports, Presidential Messages, and other State documents; and still more surprised, because many portions of the Report are written with a most charming air of sincerity and good feeling, becoming the character and position of the Commissioner. The Commissioner states that there was a warlike demonstration of the natives on the 10th of August, and that on the following day some of them began deliberately to fire on the Hoffman Mission Station. He then adds: “Thus war began, as far as I know the facts.” As the Commissioner was at Cape Palmas at that time, he must have had a personal knowledge of the facts had they been such as he relates; and the impression produced on our mind is that, not himself believing the statement to be altogether true, he was too conscientious to vouch for it. Then as regards the Land question. The Special Commissioner states that the object of the combination among the natives is “the re-possession of the territory,” which involves rights and powers that would be incompatible with the fiscal arrangements of the Liberian Government; that the natives “deny that the Liberian Government has acquired the domain; that they declare themselves the masters; that they ignore the deed of purchase by the Maryland Colonization Society, and assert that the articles therein mentioned were paid to them for landing the immigrants and building their huts.” Looking to probabilities, we cannot believe that the natives sold the entire lands of their country, and their own right of free action, but only the lands on which they permitted the immigrants of the Colonization Society to settle, assisting them in landing, building their huts, &c. We must frankly state, however, that we do not attach much importance to this. Liberia has become an organized and recognized State, with institutions framed and established on the model of the United States of America.

Which of the kings of England was it that Awujale had in his mind, whose conduct he himself follows as an example, when he says, ""He will feel bound to assist his neighbour""?

King Ja Ja, so far from attempting to monopolize the trade, has been fighting the battle of the native traders, his subjects. It is all a question of getting rid of the middleman. When trade is depressed the buyer wishes to deal directly with the seller, without the intervention of a broker. King Ja Ja and his merchants are the brokers between the producers of palm oil in the interior and the merchants who export the oil from the coast. The European traders wish to trade direct, just as we natives would like to trade direct with the manufacturers in this country. But we are not allowed; for we are compelled to submit to the brokerage charges of English middlemen. The European merchants on the coast consented to pay brokerage or commission to King Ja Ja for all oil which they bought from him, but they refused to pay commission to the native merchants, who were doing business side by side with the King. Ja Ja refused to separate his interests from those of his subjects, and insisted upon the maintenance of the treaty. It is to punish this that he has been first fined and then deposed.\'\n\n""Editor: \'Have any steps been taken to bring this matter before the Government?\'\n\n""Deputation: \'Yes; King Ja Ja sent his son and three of his chiefs to England to represent the matter before the Foreign Secretary; but they could get no answer except that Admiral Grubb would investigate the matter. When they were absent from Opobo, the traders sent for Consul Johnston, who invited King Ja Ja to a friendly meeting at Harrison\'s Beach. When King Ja Ja, relying upon the good faith of the Consul, came to the meeting, he was arrested and carried away to the Gold Coast, where he still remains, surrounded by people who cannot speak his own language, and unable to communicate his grievances to those who are sitting in judgment upon him. Consul Johnston has trampled under foot the rights of treaties, and even the ordinary usages of savage nations, in his arrest of a protected King, who accepted his apparently friendly invitation only to find himself made a prisoner and carried away from his own country. This is not honest, neither is it honest the way in which Consul Johnston goes on suppressing my trade, for instance (said one member of the deputation), and saying that he does so because of orders from home. When I came here to ask why the orders have been issued, they tell me there are no orders; Consul Johnston has never been instructed to suppress my trade. Why treat us in this way? Is this just? Is this true? Why do you make us feel that you have no respect for treaty or the rights of any persons but yourselves? You would not let us trade without middlemen.

The chief of the Christian party managed also to offend the King, and this became the signal for the outbreak of a fresh revolution. The Mohammedans attacked the Christians—who were obliged to flee for their lives, two of the chief among the latter being killed. The Mohammedans, supported by the Arabs, were now in the ascendant, new officers of state were appointed, and the missionaries—both French and English—were cast into prison, being after a few days released, and told to leave the country, with the injunction: ""Let no white man come to Buganda for two years.

In both cases the Arab traders were the instigators, though in the latter case they seem to have had matters simplified for them by the action of the German East African and Imperial authorities. If it be true that the German ships have occasionally been guilty of promiscuously shelling the coast, ""simply to overawe the natives,"" we can hardly wonder at the influence obtained by these Arab traders. In the ordinary way there is not much reason for this alliance between the natives and the Arabs—as the intercourse of the latter is generally confined to kidnapping and enslaving the former. But the presence of a common enemy is sure to drive them into alliance together. And let us remember the native mind does not grasp the difference between one European power and another. It is not in the interests of the Arab to enlighten them—on the contrary, it is clearly to his advantage to persuade them that all Europeans are bent upon their destruction. The Arab influence in East Africa is already immense. The chief obstacle to its further development lies in the hostility of the native tribes, who have trusted Europeans in preference, because they found that these have been just and considerate; but according to latest accounts, the Germans seem bent upon changing all this, and forcing the natives to make common cause with the Arabs.

The first treaty was that of 1873, which gave Ja Ja power to fine all European traders who attempted to trade beyond certain defined limits in his territory. The treaty of 1884, concluded after the Berlin Congress, established a protectorate over Opobo. All went well until 1886, when, trade in palm oil being depressed, traders wished to get rid of the middlemen and trade directly beyond the districts opened to Europeans in Opobo. To this King Ja Ja objected. Consul Hewitt had assured him that by the protectorate the Queen did not want to take his country or his markets; that she had no wish to disturb his rule. Nevertheless, because King Ja Ja refused to allow the European traders to break the express terms of his treaty by trading directly in the reserved region, he has been first fined, then his trade has been destroyed, and lastly, he has been arrested under circumstances of great treachery by Consul Johnston, and carried off a prisoner to the Gold Coast.

Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets. Ja Ja was made prisoner by Consul Johnstone, and carried off to Accra. An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river.

Some tribe is reached who cannot understand dual control; they insist on customs, perhaps; are ""chastised"" by the Consul; they retaliate, and finally an occupation is proclaimed. This is the danger to which we are exposed, for the destruction of the natives means loss to the traders and the abandonment of commerce. Let this be borne in mind, and we may escape the slough into which other nations have fallen.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1888#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Letters to the Editor: The Arrest of King Ja Ja', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'SIR,—I note in some of the daily newspapers an announcement of the arrest of King Ja Ja, of Opobo, West Africa, by the British Consul, on account of his disregard of certain trade obligations. As matters have come to such a crisis, perhaps you will allow me to lay before your readers some details of the whole matter in dispute, by which they may be better able to judge whether such arrest was really justified by the facts.\n\nAfter the famous Berlin Conference of 1884, it was arranged by the British authorities that some one should be sent out to the Oil Rivers to proclaim a Protectorate on behalf of Great Britain over the whole district; and accordingly a gentleman was sent out as Consul, who was empowered to sign a treaty with the native kings and chiefs of the various places, of which Opobo, where Ja Ja is King, was one. One of the conditions of the treaty which Ja Ja signed (Article 6) expressly prohibited strangers going to the interior markets; this condition being further substantiated by a letter from the Consul to Ja Ja; the effect and intention of this being to secure that the European agents should only obtain their goods from the interior through Ja Ja and his chiefs.\n\nAbout two years ago, owing to the depression in the oil trade, some of these agents agreed among themselves that the price of the oil and other native productions should be reduced; and Ja Ja accordingly was communicated with upon the subject, and he expressed his readiness to accept their terms; but that the ""topside"" (a general term among the traders there, meaning commission) should be allowed to him and his chiefs, as before. This the agents would not agree to; they were willing to continue the usual topside to Ja Ja himself, but not to his chiefs. Ja Ja remonstrated with them, and pointed out that Opobo was made by himself and his chiefs. Immediately a white flag was hoisted in five of the factories, which meant that they stop all further business with the natives. One of the firms concerned refused to agree to this suspension, and continued to trade as before.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1887#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE ARREST OF JA JA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Interference with prices, and that they would open up trade direct with the markets of the interior.

The King continued to put every obstacle in the way to prevent them from communicating with the natives of the interior, but Mr. H. H. Johnston, the Acting Vice-Consul of the district, succeeded in getting through to the markets of the interior, and made a treaty with the natives, under which land was granted to the English merchants, and trade was arranged with them. Subsequently the Consul and the merchants went up the river, as already reported, taking with them the materials for erecting their factories and other buildings on the land given to them. On their arrival at the entrance of the creek leading up to the interior, the party was stopped by a large band of Ja Ja's followers, who, stating that they were acting under the orders of the King, assaulted the traders with pointed sticks, fired guns at the boats, and ultimately compelled them to go back, warning them that they would not be allowed to pass without the King's permission. All this took place at some distance outside Ja Ja's territory. It is believed that there are other charges involved against the King, as about ten days after the above incident, Mr. Johnston summoned him to a meeting, and ordered him to accompany the Consul to Accra. King Ja Ja immediately gave himself up, and went on board H.M.S. Goshawk, where he remained until preparations could be made for leaving the river. After his surrender Opobo became perfectly quiet, and trade was reopened. It is stated that the merchants are now building unmolested at the markets, which are situated in a very fine country, full of produce. H.M.S. Goshawk brought the Consul and King Ja Ja and his suite round to Bonny, where they were transferred to the steamship Calabar. The Bonny men gave vent to the wildest rejoicings at his departure, as he had been interfering with their trade, as well as with that of the white men. It is possible that the deportation of King Ja Ja might not have been effected so easily and peaceably but for the skilful tactics of Captain Pelly, of the Goshawk, who manoeuvred his ship so that her guns completely commanded the crowd of 700 followers who had accompanied Ja Ja and his chiefs. These men were prevented by a small force of marines from landing on the merchants' beaches, and being massed as they were in a narrow inlet under the Goshawk's guns, they attempted no violence, and afterwards dispersed quietly when their king was placed on board the gunboat."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1887#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Trading Troubles in Western Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'To a palaver on board his gunboat all the chiefs were recently summoned by the English Consul, who said he regretted deeply to see the state into which the country had fallen, the want of unity that existed amongst the chiefs and people, and the general lawlessness that prevailed. He said he was ready to hear any complaints and suggestions that might be made and invited the various chiefs to speak out their minds fully, frankly, and freely. Possibly, when the Consul did this, he hardly knew what was in store for him, and what a wide field he had opened up, because ever since he has been sitting *de die in diem*. Complaints and mutual recriminations have been rife, allegations have been freely preferred, and often as frankly admitted, of the most horrible crimes, and the proceedings have been a record generally of murder and villainy of every description. However, patience and an enforcement—strictly necessary when one chief brought up a dispute thirty-three years old—of the statute of limitations have at length completed the charges and counter-charges, and the Consul has at length been enabled to give his decision. He certainly showed he was in earnest on the first day of the palaver by fining each of the chiefs half a puncheon of palm oil (equivalent to £5), because their canoes made a row alongside the gunboat. He has now formed a ""constitutional government,"" consisting of the three most powerful chiefs, whom he holds responsible for the administration of the Bonny territory; he has severely fined numerous of the offending chiefs, and has given directions, under a heavy penalty, for the payment of the debts owing by the chiefs to the traders, which in this river amount to some thousands of pounds sterling. It is to be hoped that after this the trade of this river, which has for some time past been yearly retrograding, will show signs of improvement. Formerly Bonny used to be emphatically *the* oil river, but latterly, year by year, its export of that commodity has been diminishing, whilst that of all the other rivers has been increasing. It is an extraordinary fact that, as the price of palm oil has been diminishing month by month, the produce of it has been increasing. This simply arises from the fact that the African is too lazy to work more than is absolutely necessary to obtain what he requires, or thinks he requires. Consequently, as the value obtained in kind for a puncheon of palm oil has diminished, he brings more oil to market to obtain an equivalent supply of gin, gunpowder, clothes, &c., to what he previously received, and so the very proceeding which arises in the first instance from a lowering in the price of the oil at home has a tendency to still further decrease prices by glutting the market.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1886#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Party Criticisms on Ashanti War Operations', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'but can scarcely fail to be regarded with a mixture of sorrow and disgust by all who are not blinded by ignorance or party feeling, which, like the snake, converts the most delicious things into poison. We have never, in African matters, been partizans of either Conservative or Liberal Administrations. Both, and equally, have, to our mind, dealt neglectfully and unwisely, and therefore unjustly and injuriously, with Western Africa. But when we see an attempt to overwhelm the late Administration with such questions as the following, we become for a moment partizans of the late Government, notwithstanding all its errors and shortcomings, of which we have felt personally the sad effects. ""How did the quarrel with King Koffee Kalcalli arise? In obedience to what principle of national duty did we send an expedition beyond the Prah? What advantage have we secured by burning down Kumasi, and shattering the power of the only negro State which offered any semblance of a stable government? What do we hope to gain by peace and friendship with the Ashantees, supposing that we have inclined them thereto by the measures we have taken for their destruction? We have to satisfy our national conscience on all these points, or else we shall have won what is something less than even a barren triumph."" This is meant, no doubt, to be a formidable indictment, yet the answer is simple enough. The quarrel with King Kalcalli dates from his predecessor\'s reign, in 1862, when the Gold Coast authorities refused to deliver up the refugee ""Ganim."" No peace has since been made. It was always understood that the Ashantees were busy accumulating ammunition, and the Dutch withdrawal and Elmina discontent, brought the slumbering hostilities to a head again. It is not difficult to prove that it was our duty to rid the Protectorate of them. The only error was, that that was not understood at the commencement, before they half-ruined the country and bearded us in our seacoast forts. It being our duty to get rid of them, it must have been equally our duty to get rid of them effectually. This could only be done by what has since been done—by following them into their own territory, destroying their military prestige, burning their capital, and shattering the power ""of the only negro State which offered any semblance of a stable government."" Detestable government, might well have been said. As to what we hope to gain by peace and friendship with them, after the measures we have taken for their destruction, the reply is not difficult. Having gained a full assurance of peace for the Protectorate, by destroying the military prestige and power of its only enemy, we give that humbled enemy liberty to carry on, as heretofore, that trade with the sea-coast without which he cannot live; and which he could not have ventured on without a treaty, because the Assins, Wassaws, Denkeras, &c., would have murdered and plundered the traders, on the ground of their being still enemies. The Ashantees, and the people of their formerly tributary states and others beyond, cannot exist without communication with the Coast, for that most indispensable article, salt, and many others. We wish them to have these; we have an advantage in their coming to buy them in our territory: we guarantee them, by treaty, peaceable access, on certain terms. This will give them again their old advantages as intermediate traders between the seacoast and the people beyond. In the supposition that there is an engagement on the part of the King of Ashanti that there shall be no more human sacrifices, this is sneered at as having ""a shining moral appearance."" When we reflect on the myriads of human beings that have been offered there in sacrifice, until the whole atmosphere of the capital was poisoned by the sickly exhalation from human gore and putrefying carcases, we feel ineffable disgust at this ""shining moral appearance."" If no other good end had been obtained by us, this one alone, if obtained, is worthy of a great Christian civilized nation; and, should be deemed, if power has duties as well as rights, a full and exceeding recompense for the effort we have made, even though the ""sacrifice of other lives which it has entailed"" should all be debited to this account, which we deny. As to the war ""having been always unnecessary,"" we have not space to join issue on the point as it deserves. All we shall say is, it can only be deemed unnecessary, provided it could be established that, if earlier measures had been taken by the Cape Coast Government to aid the native tribes of the Protectorate, they alone would have sufficed for rolling back the invasion. We always believed this might have been effected. But even then the war could scarcely be deemed unnecessary, as the territories would have been continually threatened with invasion and devastation, murder, and all other enormities of barbarian inroads. There was no permanent remedy to be found, no permanent security to be obtained, save by the invasion of Ashanti. This has been, happily, accomplished, and however party feeling may suffer at the too speedy and economical success, we rejoice that there is no longer any probability of our ever having again to deplore an Ashanti invasion of the Gold Coast.', 'last_edit_date': '1874-03-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/28_03_1874#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ENGLISH CIVILISATION IN THE NIGER REGION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""And what impression has your tour made?""—""We have returned well satisfied with the work of administration and also with the commercial development which is going on.

In 1856 he completed his second journey across Central Africa from Angola to the Zambezi delta. Prior to this period, the Church Missionary Society had sent three German missionaries to start work in East Africa. Johann Krapf arrived in Mombasa in 1844 and was followed by J. Rebmann in 1846 and by J.J. Erhardt in 1849. Their mission station was established at Rabai near Mombasa. By 1856 Rebmann had crossed the Nyika plain to Kilimanjaro to become the first European to see the mountain, and Krapf had gone farther south to visit the Shambaa kingdom of Kimweri and then north› wards to the Kamba country where he was the first European to be shown Mount Kenya. Erhardt and Krapf also travelled farther south to the mouth of the Ruvuma and later, after spending some time in Tanga, Erhardt was able to publish a map of East Africa containing a mass of information he had gathered on the coast about the interior, including the Great Lakes, which he represented as an inland sea. Erhardt's 'map was to be the main inspiration of Burton and Speke in their expedition of 1858'. 51 This first group of missionaries acted as pioneers; they gathered con› siderable information that was extremely valuable to those who followed them. Yet their information hardly came to the attention of the general public and it was only when Livingstone began his attacks on the Arab slave trade in speeches and writings that the popular imagination was caught. In the spirit of the capitalist free-trade conviction of his time, Livingstone was emphasizing the power of commerce, which, he believed, would integrate the vast interior with Christian Europe, thus relieving Africans of the poverty and humiliation caused by the slave trade. He therefore concentrated on travelling in search of navigable rivers, or what he called the 'open path for commerce and Christianity'.$^{52}$ The publication of his Missionary Travels$^{53}$ in 1857, together with his personal appeals, inspired the formation of the Universities Mission to Central Africa (UMCA) by a group of English High Churchmen.

Upon the character of this region science has spent its speculations, and the exploration of it has been the hard work of ages. Africa, in fact, has been the world's huge problem. From Cæsar to Speke, the origin of the Nile has been mankind's greatest puzzle. Unsolved though it be, the attempts to trace it out have been of the greatest service. No longer esteemed a howling wilderness, or a death-stricken morass, the interior of Africa, from the southern border of Sahara down to our own limits, we know to be singularly fertile, and by no means insalubrious. The western shore, north of Walwisch Bay, gives ample evidence that a wealthy country lies beyond—a country rich in minerals and vegetation—blessed in all save the savage races that seal it up from the view of civilization. Going north, we find, near the equator, a tract of splendid hill-land, where the Cameroon Mountains reach to a height of 14,000 or 15,000 feet, and where the climate is so genial, that Captain Burton recommended its fitness for a penal settlement. Here we have come to the most remarkable part of the continent. Beyond the Cameroons extends that vast depression which intersects Africa, at a high altitude, from the equator to the Cape. Then, on the other side of the still unknown territory, we come to the wonderful lake-land, whose inland seas, fringed by the palm-growth of the tropics, are overshadowed by the snowy peaks, and embraced by the crescent arms of the mystic Mountains of the Moon. Here, in what may naturally be regarded as the hottest part of Africa, lying exactly across the equator, is a land which, according to Speke and Grant, is one of the finest in the world. Owing to its height above the sea-level, the climate is singularly pleasant, and is so far from being excessively hot, that Captain Grant walked through the whole of it in woollen clothing, and slept every night between blankets. 750 different specimens brought away by these travellers attest the abundance and variety of the vegetation there. All the necessaries and many luxuries of savage life grow without much effort, and the natives lead an easy and somewhat gluttonous existence, in the rank enjoyment of the many gifts of nature. From all we know, and that recent travellers have told us, the whole of East Africa, between Natal and the equator, bears the same character. Dr. Livingstone has found the cotton plant growing abundantly throughout the valleys and river plains north of the Zambezi. On this side of that river exists a country that is utterly unexplored as yet.

They say that for beauty of aspect and natural fertility it exceeds any of the southern divisions, and the people of Moselekatsc, who rules as the emperor of it, are known to be in advance of the tribes on this side of them.

Against the supposition is the fact that I saw no snow on the latter in 1876, that its shape is vastly different, and that Ruwenzori is a little too far west for the position I gave of Gordon Bennett, and I doubt that Gordon Bennett Mount could be seen from a distance of eighty geographical miles in an atmosphere not very remarkable for its clearness. I should say that the snow line seemed to be about 1,000 ft. from the summit.

Stairs in June attempted to reach the summit of the snowy Ruwenzori, which Mr. Stanley assures us is identical with the ""Mountains of the Moon"" of the ancients. Lieut. Stairs only reached a height of 10,600 ft., progress being stopped by three deep ravines, covered with dense vegetation, that lay between them and the nearest snowy peak, which rose to a further height of 6,000 ft. The mountain sides up to 8,000 ft. are inhabited by a people who disappeared before Lieut. Stairs and his party. Bamboo forests clothe the lower mountain sides, above which was a dense growth of heaths rising to 20 ft. The night was bitterly cold, a great contrast to the valley they had left, and yet the thermometer registered 60 deg. when the party turned in for the night. The upper part of the peak before him Lieut. Stairs could see was devoid of vegetation. The top is crowned with a mass of jagged and precipitous rock, and has a distinct crater-like form. In the distance another peak could be seen having a similar form. Lieut. Stairs concludes that the Ruwenzori is really an extinct volcano; the whole having a resemblance to the mountains of Auvergne.\n\nMr. Stanley\'s own notes on the physical geography of the lake region are highly interesting. If, he says, you draw a straight line from the debouchere of the Nile from Lake Albert in a south-west direction, you measure a broad line of subsidence from twenty to fifty miles wide, in the centre of the African Continent. On the west of this is a great upland rising to 3,000 ft. To the east is another upland, rising from 1,000 ft. to 3,000 ft. and trending gently eastwards on the Unyoro plateau. In this section lies the Albert Nyanza. In the south section, only fifty miles long, lies Lake Albert Edward and the plains between the lake and the mountain. Thus, Lake Albert Edward is comparatively small, not more than half the length of the north lake. The part of the Semliki valley which extends from the lake south-westerly is very level; and, in Mr. Stanley\'s opinion, of recent formation. At seventy-five miles from the Albert Nyanza the valley attains a height of about 900 ft. above the lake, and then the forest region ends, and a new climate is reached.'}, {'id': 6721, 'article_title': 'AFRICA AND ITS TRADE POSSIBILITIES.', 'full_section_title': 'AFRICA AND ITS TRADE POSSIBILITIES.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1896#article-6', 'issue_date': '02_03_1896', 'content': 'On Feb. 13, an interesting lecture, entitled ""A Naturalist on the Mountains of the Moon,"" was delivered at the Royal Institution, Liverpool, under the auspices of the Liverpool Geographical Society, by Mr. G.

Mr. Scott Elliot, by his recent visit to Ruwenzori, has afforded additional information about this magnificent range of mountains in Central Africa, and his treatment of the subject was graphic and most informing. The address was made the more interesting by a series of limelight views. After touching on the character of Africa generally, the lecturer proceeded to give an account of the mountain Ruwenzori, the various difficulties in climbing the primeval forest, its inhabitants, the bamboo zone, the peat mosses, and the various tribes round the mountain. The occurrence of recent volcanic craters, and the manner in which the cloud hangs over the mountain all day long, only disappearing about sunset, was fully illustrated by slides from photographs taken by the lecturer. The lecturer described his experiences. Leopards attacked his camp, and very nearly killed two of his porters. A woman was carried off by a lioness, and he vainly attempted to rescue her. Elephants were extremely abundant round the mountain. The Natives were usually friendly, though the difficulty of obtaining supplies was often considerable, and on one occasion three of his men were attacked by them, and one very severely wounded. His march to the South was one of extraordinary difficulty, as his caravan consisted only of fourteen men, and the people were in places extremely unfriendly, and on one occasion attacked his porters. The future value of these little-known regions was shown by him to depend mainly on three factors—First, the natural wild resources, as rubber, palm oil, minerals, and ivory; secondly, the prospects of plantation by Europeans; and thirdly, the health of Europeans. The country between 3,000 and 5,000 feet had been proved to be valuable for plantations of coffee and tobacco. It is only in Africa above 5,000 feet that there is any possibility of a real colony being formed. The lecturer expressed his opinion that with the knowledge we have now of these parts, the Masai Highlands certainly appear to be quite healthy enough for Europeans to live and bring up children; but that so far there is no sufficient inducement for colonisation at present. Then, turning to the needs of Great Britain at the present time, he suggested that the three main requisites at present were—first, that our imports of food and raw material should come from our own Colonies; secondly, new markets; and thirdly, an outlet for our capital and population, both of which were unnaturally locked up in Great Britain. These new countries were, according to him, exactly adapted to answer those three urgent necessities.'}]","[{'document_title': ""MR.

After alluding to the services which Scotland has rendered to geographical science, especially in the person of Livingstone, Mr. O\'Neill described the circumstances which induced him to resolve to fill up, as far as possible, the great blank in the map of Eastern Africa. The results of his journeys Mr. O\'Neill summarised as follows:—\n\n""Briefly, the chief results have been to open up three new routes between the Nyassa district and the coast: 1, between Mozambique and Lake Shirwa and Blantyre; 2, from Blantyre to the Portuguese settlements of Angoche and Parapato; 3, from Quillimane to Blantyre. You know the length of time it took to get overland to Lake Nyassa from the east coast. Many of you remember the hardships encountered by Bishop Steere when getting over the same ground. The Nyassa may now be reached by the longest route in thirty days, and by that from Quillimane to Blantyre in fourteen. The country you pass over is well-populated, food abundant, and the people peaceable, helpful, and industrious. There are difficulties of course, African travel is never without them; but any or all of the three routes I have laid down may be constantly traversed by Europeans, and become most valuable channels for the development of the trade and agriculture of the country. In my journeys I have been fortunate enough to discover three minor lakes: one, Lake Lidedi, just south of the Rovuma, and close to Lake Nargadi, of which Livingstone first heard as he passed north of that river upon his last travels. The others are Lake Amaramba and Cheuta, which have their outlet in the River Lujenda. When in the neighbourhood of these lakes I closely investigated the question of the supposed connexion of Lake Shirwa with the Lujenda drainage system, and satisfied myself that there was no point of junction between them. Lake Shirwa is divided from the Lakes Cheuta and Amaramba by a broad elevated ridge of sandy soil, lightly wooded and covered with thick undergrowth, and I have nowhere detected trace of inundation or evidence of the rising of Lake Shirwa above the level of its foot. It is possible that a subterranean junction exists, and this view is held by many natives.""\n\nMr. O\'Neill dwelt upon the importance of a reliable meridian in the interior for the traveller. He described the very interesting evidences of glacial action met with in the hilly regions, and stated he had never met with any traces of subsequent volcanic action, and that he doubts the hypotheses respecting volcanic disturbance. Remarking that though Eastern Africa has not the exuberant vegetation or magnificent forests of Brazil, the Congo region, and other parts of the world, Mr. O\'Neill added that the air is drier, there is less malaria, and the country is more fit for the residence of Europeans.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-07-08', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1885#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'WEST COAST OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Between the north and the south of Africa spread about 7,000,000 square miles of almost unknown land.

South of 4°9 lat. it became gradually flatter and lower, and there was less rainfall. There were many evidences of volcanic action, and iron ore was found in abundance, as well as coarse granite, and mountains of shining white quartz ammonites were also found near the Dawa. With regard to the course of the Omo river, he expressed the belief that it flowed east, and was identical with the Juba. This opinion was strengthened when he discovered that the river Nianam, which flowed into Lake Rudolf, rose about 120 miles north of that lake. The party came to a large and warlike tribe called the Arbore, inhabiting half of the valley above Lake Stefanie. In contrast to the Arbore, the many little tribes further north received the party with every show of friendship. Dr. Smith gave an account of one of these tribes—the Dume. ""These Dume,"" he said, ""are dwarfs, their average height being only five feet—we saw none over five feet two inches,—woolly haired, and very black, with flat noses and large lips. They resemble other dwarf tribes found in Africa. But they have very graceful, well-formed bodies. They lived in little hamlets composed of about fifty small huts each, and scattered among the mountains. They owned goats and sheep and raised a little millet. The other tribes visited by the explorers were friendly, with the exception of occasional attempts at petty thieving. The rough mountainous country presented every obstacle to progress. There were no roads, and they had to make paths over ridges 2,000 feet high above the surrounding country. However, Lake Rudolf was near, and Dr. Smith and his party were to be the first to reach it from the east. The expedition had been a hard one, but the party achieved all they set out to do, and more. Dr. Smith then set out for the north along the Nianam, eventually finding himself in an open valley where the ripe durrha was waving to and fro, the goats were nibbling at the soft green grass, and noises from a score of villages reached his ears. The Natives were the most sociable and hospitable black people yet seen. They were very black, and of medium height. They were far above the average in civilisation. Their ornaments and articles of daily use were wonderfully well made. Having come into contact with no Native traders, they possessed nothing in the way of beads or brass. They almost fought with one another to sell anything they had for a string or two of the cheaper sort of beads. He bought supplies of coffee, meal, and tobacco, and some ivory. As to Lake Rudolf itself, Dr. Smith could add nothing to the accounts furnished by Lieutenant Von Hohnel. The different species of insects numbered three thousand.

His description of some characteristics of the forest which had to be penetrated is worth quoting. The difficulties ""consisted of creepers ranging from 6in. to 15in. in diameter, swinging across the path in bowlines or loops, sometimes massed and twisted together; also of a low dense bush, occupying the sites of old clearings, which had to be carved through before a passage was possible. Where years had elapsed since the clearings had been abandoned, we found a young forest and the spaces between the trees choked with climbing plants, vegetable creepers, and tall plants. This kind had to be tunnelled through before an inch of progress could be made."" This is the forest through which Livingstone struggled his way in the Manyuema country in the months before Stanley relieved him. Mr. Stanley shows that the region traversed by him is probably the most extensive forest region in Africa, a region resembling the forest region of South America. Mr. Stanley has definitely settled the courses of an important affluent of the Congo and its tributaries; he has defined the southern limits of the Albert Nyanza, and found that it is rapidly decreasing; he has all but established the fact of the existence of a separate lake to the south, which probably drains into the Congo and not into the Nile; and no doubt on his return he will tell us more of the snowy mountain rivalling Kilimanjaro, far away to the south-east of his standpoint on the west shore of Albert Nyanza. It seems clear that the natural outlet of the region around Albert Nyanza is not by the Aruwimi, but eastwards by Victoria Nyanza and British East Africa.

Even the stolid and unromantic Masai natives have never lost the awe with which the sublime spectacle of the colossal ""Ngaje Nagi"" impressed their fathers. Heaved up during some of those vast volcanic convulsions of which it remains the principal record, it is likely to be the goal for an ever-increasing troop of scientific pilgrims. It may even become a sanatorium for Zanzibar and Mozambique. Although it stands completely apart from the neighbouring heights, Kilimanjaro is only one of many summits which crown the east ridge of the great plateau of Equatorial Africa. About a hundred miles to the north, across the Kapté and Kikuyu Plains, are Kenia and Subugu La Poron in the Aberdare Range, and still further north the snow-clad Lekakisero; while due west, at about a third of the distance, Mount Meru, a noble Alpine mass, rises from the jungle at its base. Kilimanjaro, with its shining head, which the natives insist is silver, is, therefore, only one summit of the Alpine region of the Dark Continent, and in time, perhaps, will share with Mount Cook and Mount Everest the suffrages of the climbers who feel that the Rocky Mountains have grown stale, and the Atlas too familiar to possess their ancient zest. Meantime, every fresh particular about it is worthy of record. The banana is grown up to a height of five thousand nine hundred feet, after which no villages are met with, there being little to attract an agricultural race such as the natives who people the centre and lower slopes.

F. Scott-Elliot, who accompanied the Anglo-French Boundary Commission to Sierra Leone, has prepared a report to the Colonial Office, on the botany and geology of that Colony. Mr. Scott-Elliot says that this country seems to be everywhere underlaid by a gneissose or granitoid rock, varying in appearance from a coarse red or gray granite to a foliated gneiss. This rock appears on the seacoast at Sierra Leone, and forms the tops of most of the higher plateaux: thus the Sugarloaf at Sierra Leone consists of a rock of this nature, and it also forms the broad watershed between Fulaba and Farana, which separates the Scarcies, Rokelle, and Niger drainage areas. This rock, though common and apparently fundamental everywhere, is not often seen on the surface. Almost the whole of the country between the sea level and 2,000 feet is covered by varieties of a reddish laterate or iron-pan, sometimes hard and barren, but usually porous, easily worked, and of a fertile nature. On the top of Mount Kofin he found a thick band of horizontal sandstones, which struck him as being similar to the so-called Nubian sandstones seen about Wady Halfa, on the Nile. There is also a very well-marked dolerite or basalt flow in the north-west corner of the English sphere of influence, traces of which were found at Wallia and Buyabuya, on the Scarcies River, and which forms a dyke twenty to thirty miles long, on the summit of the hills about Ninia and Duunia in the Talla country. In the immediate neighbourhood of this flow there are some much hardened slates or argillites, and the country is especially fertile where fragments of this dolerite are mingled with gneiss and sandstone. The dolerite itself is used by the natives as hones for sharpening knives, &c. The only mineral of importance is iron, of which the country contains a very large amount. There is a peculiarly rich belt of titaniferous iron ore in the hills behind Sierra Leone. Judging from the colour there would seem to be a very large amount of iron in the country. It is not at all unusual to find the smelting places of the natives in certain districts. In other respects the country seems destitute of mineral wealth, though Mr. Elliot could not speak with any certainty. The soil, so far as the Commission saw, could be roughly grouped into three classes. First, that of the plateaux and hills about 2,000 feet, or sometimes descending to 1,000 feet, which is due to the disintegration of gneiss or granite rocks. Second, the red laterite, which covers the lower hills from the sea level to 1,000 or 2,000 feet. Third, the alluvium, due either to the action of the mangroves along the coast, or to the rivers and streams inland.

In the Cameroon river and Bimbia, as in Calabar and the Niger delta, slaves were used in producing palm oil and palm kernels and other commodities of legitimate commerce. At Bimbia and the Cameroon river, an important variation was the well-organized system by which Kings William and Bell hired out some of their slaves to the West African Company at Fernando Po.

Though, as both A. E. Afigbo and G. N.

The first of these is the fact that some of these boundaries cut across pre-existing ethnic groups, states and kingdoms and this has caused widespread social disruption and displace› ment. The Bakongo are, for instance, found divided by the boundaries of Angola, Belgian Congo (now Zaire), French Congo (now Congo) and Gabon. Today, some of the Ewe live in Ghana, some in Togo and some in Benin; the Somali are shared among Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti; the Senufo are found in Mali, Ivory Coast and Upper Volta. The examples can be multiplied. One important consequence of this situation has been the chronic border disputes that have plagued the relations between some independent African states - such as those between Sudan and Uganda; between Somalia and Ethiopia; between Kenya and Somalia; between Ghana and Togo; and between Nigeria and Cameroon.

It says: ""The locality where the earthquake occurred is the great coffee district of South America. The region affected by the shocks covers five degrees of latitude, and is 500 miles wide. The shock extended in a north-east direction along the northern range of the Andes. It was felt first very perceptibly at Bogota, the capital of New Granada, thence seemed to travel north, gathering intensity as it advanced, until it reached the south-east boundary-line of Magdalena, where the work of destruction began, continuing as it advanced along the eastern boundary of Magdalena, following the line of the mountain range, and destroying in part or whole the cities of Cucuta, San Antonio, El Bsario, Salazar, San Cristobal, San Cayetano, and Santiago. The destruction was greatest in Gramalato, Arboledas, Cúcuta, and Cucuta. Of the 14,000 persons who died from the effects of the earthquake only about 5,000 were killed outright; the remainder died in a short time from fever and lock-jaw, which in that region nearly always supervene when severe injuries have been received. The first premonition of the terrible visitation occurred on the night of May 17, when a strange rumbling sound was heard beneath the ground, although no earthquake occurred. It seemed as if a huge boulder had been propelled over the earth, causing a rattling of windows and doors and a trembling of crockery. It travelled in the direction afterwards taken by the earthquake, and lasted only a few minutes. It excited fears, which soon subsided when no serious results followed. But on the morning of May 18 a terrible shock occurred, which brought consternation to all the inhabitants of Cucuta. It suddenly shook down the walls of houses, tumbled down churches and the principal buildings, burying the citizens of the place in the ruins. Another shock completed the work of desolation by throwing down the walls that still remained standing. Three more shocks followed of equal intensity, but there appears to be no evidence that there were any openings in the earth, which on similar occasions have engulfed buildings and inhabitants, at least not in Cucuta. The shocks, with lesser force, however, seem to have been felt throughout the whole region of the earthquake for two days afterwards, extending to Cartagena and the western sea-coast. The scenes that followed the first shocks are described as being most fearful and terrible. In this hour of destruction, when men and women were praying for relief and mercy, others who had escaped immediately began an indiscriminate pillage, searching the ruins for treasure, and in many cases robbing the dying and dead. The desire for plunder was so great in some instances that the robbers murdered persons who were caught in the falling timbers, and who could not extricate themselves, though only slightly injured. The vaults of the banking-houses were penetrated, and large sums of money stolen. \'The thieves were monarchs of the ruins,\' said a correspondent. Then, to add to the horror of the calamity, the Lobotera Volcano suddenly began to shoot out lava in immense quantities, or, as a correspondent writes, \'it sent out a mass of molten lava in the form of incandescent balls of fire into the city.\' Some of these balls fell upon the German drug stores of Thiers and Co. and Van Diesel and Co., setting them on fire immediately. The flames communicated with the adjoining dwellings. A shower of lava set the ruins of the large city in flames while the earth was still quaking. It is probable that the next crop of coffee will suffer greatly, as the survivors cannot be induced to return to the region laid desolate, and they have become so panic-stricken that no future efforts will probably produce any effect upon them. Affairs are in a terrible state. The bodies of the dead are becoming decomposed under the tropical heat, and the stench fills the atmosphere for miles around."" The earthquake is considered the most disastrous of the last two centuries. A committee of the Spanish residents of New York has been formed in that city for the purpose of affording relief to the sufferers.'}, {'id': 5410, 'article_title': 'Cable-Laying on the African Coast', 'full_section_title': 'Cable-Laying on the African Coast', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1886#article-5', 'issue_date': '01_09_1886', 'content': 'Besides negroes and monkeys, we met sharks.

The most dreaded shark round there is the hammer-head. Less shy than the others, they will swim round the ship for hours, and we made many attempts to catch one, but without success. The meaning of their name is obvious when you see one. The skull has a great protuberance on each side, reaching out to a greater width than that of the body at the thickest part, so that the head resembles very much the head of a hammer, whose handle is the body. Very ferocious they are, and as their mouths reach the whole width of the hammer-head, it requires no great skill on their part to catch some part of the sailor overboard whom luck has sent. The white shark is much larger than the hammer-head, but we could only see one by dropping in an empty egg box or potato basket, which succulent dainty would often bring him up from below.\n\nAfter leaving the African coast when we had done our work, we went to the Cape de Verde Islands, where is the Cable Company\'s office, to ""inaugurate"" the cables. The inauguration consisted in giving a party to the island, to which almost every one was asked. Every shade of complexion was there, from the beautiful olive of the Portuguese lady to the all but pure negress. The party was very refined. The entertainment offered was music and supper. Those who could sing, sang. The others drank whiskies and sodas in the verandah. We all had supper. The entertainment went on for a long time afterwards. I believe it was the only party that had been given on the island within the memory of man.\n\nAs to the islands, they are volcanic, and the hills rise to a great height above the sea—in some cases almost straight out of it. In these small islands two hills rise to four or five times the height of any of Europe, and are, in the north, precipitous from top to bottom. The famous Peak of Teneriffe, which is a perfectly symmetrical cone, is still an active volcano. This reaches an elevation nearly equal to the two rocks at Cape de Verde.\n\nIn leaving Cape de Verde, our work was done, and the expedition was over. Our voyage home was saddened by the death of a cable hand from sunstroke, a little south of Gibraltar.

Stairs in June attempted to reach the summit of the snowy Ruwenzori, which Mr. Stanley assures us is identical with the ""Mountains of the Moon"" of the ancients. Lieut. Stairs only reached a height of 10,600 ft., progress being stopped by three deep ravines, covered with dense vegetation, that lay between them and the nearest snowy peak, which rose to a further height of 6,000 ft. The mountain sides up to 8,000 ft. are inhabited by a people who disappeared before Lieut. Stairs and his party. Bamboo forests clothe the lower mountain sides, above which was a dense growth of heaths rising to 20 ft. The night was bitterly cold, a great contrast to the valley they had left, and yet the thermometer registered 60 deg. when the party turned in for the night. The upper part of the peak before him Lieut. Stairs could see was devoid of vegetation. The top is crowned with a mass of jagged and precipitous rock, and has a distinct crater-like form. In the distance another peak could be seen having a similar form. Lieut. Stairs concludes that the Ruwenzori is really an extinct volcano; the whole having a resemblance to the mountains of Auvergne.\n\nMr. Stanley\'s own notes on the physical geography of the lake region are highly interesting. If, he says, you draw a straight line from the debouchere of the Nile from Lake Albert in a south-west direction, you measure a broad line of subsidence from twenty to fifty miles wide, in the centre of the African Continent. On the west of this is a great upland rising to 3,000 ft. To the east is another upland, rising from 1,000 ft. to 3,000 ft. and trending gently eastwards on the Unyoro plateau. In this section lies the Albert Nyanza. In the south section, only fifty miles long, lies Lake Albert Edward and the plains between the lake and the mountain. Thus, Lake Albert Edward is comparatively small, not more than half the length of the north lake. The part of the Semliki valley which extends from the lake south-westerly is very level; and, in Mr. Stanley\'s opinion, of recent formation. At seventy-five miles from the Albert Nyanza the valley attains a height of about 900 ft. above the lake, and then the forest region ends, and a new climate is reached.'}, {'id': 6691, 'article_title': ""A Lady's Adventures in West Africa"", 'full_section_title': ""A Lady's Adventures in West Africa"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1896#article-14', 'issue_date': '01_01_1896', 'content': ""despatched by the elephant-men.

The case came before the Queen\'s Bench Division, on a petition of right by Edward Ernest Dunn, in which the suppliant claimed to be entitled to certain salary under an alleged contract of service for three years. In 1892 the suppliant was appointed Consular Agent in the Oil Rivers Protectorate by Sir Claude (then Major) Macdonald, her Majesty\'s Commissioner and Consul-General in the Protectorate. The terms on which the suppliant was appointed were said to be contained in a letter, which had since been lost, written by Sir Claude Macdonald to Major Verner, who was employed by Sir Claude to obtain fit men for the posts of Vice-Consul and of Consular Agent. One of the terms was said to be that the appointment was to be for three years certain. The suppliant was dismissed in October 1893. The Crown did not attempt to justify the dismissal, but it was contended that appointments under the Crown could only be during the pleasure of the Crown, and that Sir Claude Macdonald had no power to make an appointment for a fixed time. For the suppliant it was argued that, though with regard to military appointments the rule was as stated, there was no authority for extending it to Civil servants. Mr. Justice Day gave judgment for the Crown, and the suppliant now appealed.'}]","[{'document_title': ""CAPTAIN BURTON'S ASCENT OF THE CAMEROONS MOUNTAIN."", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Our readers have been made aware by our advertisements relative to a proposed emigration of Christian coloured families from Canada to Ambas (or Amboises) Bay, on the West Coast of Africa, that immediately behind the small settlement of the Baptist Missionary Society at Victoria, in that bay, there rises a magnificent mountain, more than 13,000 feet in height, and which appears to have been known to the ancients under the name of ""Theon Ochema."" This mountain is part of a range that has been already seen to extend some ninety miles into the interior, in a south-easterly direction. In modern times its summit had never been reached; and the statement of the ancient writer, that it exhibited flames of fire by night, has been regarded as doubtful: for although the natives of the district affirm the same thing, Europeans have never witnessed this remarkable phenomenon. All doubts of the volcanic character of the mountain are now, however, set at rest, its peak having been lately visited by Captain Burton, Her Majesty\'s Consul, in company with a Baptist missionary, the Rev. A. Saker, the Government botanist, Mr. Mann, and a Spanish gentleman from Fernando Po. Captain Burton is the well-known traveller in the East and among the Mormons; and it is from his report to Earl Russell that the following particulars of the ascent are derived.\n\nCaptain Burton states that only two attempts to reach the summit had been made for four centuries at least; one in 1847, by a Baptist missionary, the lamented Merrick, failed through want of water, after he had emerged from the belt of forest which covers the lower slopes of the mountain. Mr. Mann attempted it in 1860, but time failed him. It remained for the present party ""to scale the glorious pinnacle which never yet felt the foot of man.""\n\nOn the 18th December, 1861, all being ready, Captain Burton, with the Spaniard, entered the ""lovely bay of Victoria,"" where he found Mr. Saker awaiting him. Mr. Mann had started in advance. Early the next morning the party set out with Mr. Johnson* as an interpreter, and several Kroomen to carry the luggage. The route lay through a noble forest of palms, acacias, African oak, and other fine timber trees, and through a country admirably adapted for cocoa, sugar, and coffee. Twice they forded the ""bright little mountain stream which supplies Victoria with the purest water,"" passing west of Mount Henry, ""a site,"" says Captain Burton, ""which I at once fixed upon as a provisional sanitarium, to be prepared before the grand institution near the summit of the mountain.""\n\nAfter four hours\' walking they halted for breakfast at a village of the chief Miyombi, 23,420 feet from Victoria, and 1,000 feet above the sea.

The lava fields are in many instances covered with grass, growing in a soil formed by disintegration of the once molten rock; and, unlike what we find in some mountains of this description, the slopes of Kilimanjaro are pastoral rather than picturesque. The melting snows coursed athwart the path taken by Dr. Meyer across the saddle connecting Kibo and Kemawenzi, the two peaks into which the mountain mass has settled. But one of the most remarkable physical facts about Kilimanjaro is that not a single stream descends its sides, except on the southern aspect. Mr. Thomson, who first observed this feature, mentions a score of rivulets, many of them of considerable size, which course through the Chaga country. Yet they all rise on the southern side of the mountain, and, joining in the plain below, form the Pangani River. The plants and animals of Kilimanjaro are in some respects not quite so remarkable as they were hoped to be. The plants are, indeed, many of them peculiar; but only a very few of them belong to those European forms which are known to exist on the Cameroons and Abyssinian mountains. The large animals of the neighbouring region are abundant on the mountain, and it would appear that in this isolated region, cut off from the hot plain below, many insects and plants have, by a process of natural selection, attained a character so marked that Kilimanjaro is, as it were, an island on the African Continent. When the other peaks are fully explored, it may be found that in Africa there exists an Alpine life similar to that known to inhabit the high lands of other continents. But Kilimanjaro is too far both from the north and from the south to have been affected by that glacial period which, driving the Polar plants into lower latitudes, left them stranded in these uplands when the ice cleared away, and the world resumed its wonted aspect.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-01-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_01_1888#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.631, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE GERMANS IN AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dr. Max Buchner recently gave a lecture in the Architektenhaus, Berlin, in connexion with the German Colonial Association, on the value and the future of the Cameroons.

As a plantation and trading colony, the Cameroons were of undoubted value, but to encourage emigration thither on any great scale would be criminal. The products of the land included the oil palm, the cocoa-nut palm, coffee and cocoa, quinine, indigo, caoutchouc, rice, and sugar. The oil palm only grew wild at present, but it could be cultivated. The cultivation of the cocoa-nut palm had also been neglected. As to coffee, the question of sale had to be considered, and the market was now overrun. Cocoa would pay better, and this could be easily cultivated. The Cameroon mountains offered an excellent ground for cultivating quinine, while rice and sugar were to be grown in the lowlands. Dr. Buchner spoke of the necessity of opening up the inland region, and hinted at the possibility of a railway proving in time remunerative. Meanwhile beasts of burden would have to be used—especially oxen, as they throve better and were capable of more work than horses or asses. As elephants were very abundant there—more so than in any other part of Africa—an attempt should be made to tame them. The ultimate opinion expressed by Dr. Buchner was that the Cameroons would pay the costs of keeping and administering it. Africa as a whole was regarded as a poor country, but the Cameroons belonged to the richest parts.\n\nA letter has been received from Dr. Fischer, who is now exploring in East Africa, in which he announces that he arrived in 101 days at the Victoria Nyanza. In Usukumo he took the roundabout way of the Finier River in order to avoid paying the high tribute. Mr. Stoss, of the Church Mission, who has been in Uganda, has told him that the waterway from Kagehi to Uganda is only possible in that the tribute is so high that no goods remain when it has been paid. Dr. Fischer had on the day of writing sent a letter to the King of Uganda, asking permission to visit him, and he was of good hope that he would surmount all difficulties.\n\nLieut.

The lava fields are in many instances covered with grass, growing in a soil formed by disintegration of the once molten rock; and, unlike what we find in some mountains of this description, the slopes of Kilimanjaro are pastoral rather than picturesque. The melting snows coursed athwart the path taken by Dr. Meyer across the saddle connecting Kibo and Kemawenzi, the two peaks into which the mountain mass has settled. But one of the most remarkable physical facts about Kilimanjaro is that not a single stream descends its sides, except on the southern aspect. Mr. Thomson, who first observed this feature, mentions a score of rivulets, many of them of considerable size, which course through the Chaga country. Yet they all rise on the southern side of the mountain, and, joining in the plain below, form the Pangani River. The plants and animals of Kilimanjaro are in some respects not quite so remarkable as they were hoped to be. The plants are, indeed, many of them peculiar; but only a very few of them belong to those European forms which are known to exist on the Cameroons and Abyssinian mountains. The large animals of the neighbouring region are abundant on the mountain, and it would appear that in this isolated region, cut off from the hot plain below, many insects and plants have, by a process of natural selection, attained a character so marked that Kilimanjaro is, as it were, an island on the African Continent. When the other peaks are fully explored, it may be found that in Africa there exists an Alpine life similar to that known to inhabit the high lands of other continents. But Kilimanjaro is too far both from the north and from the south to have been affected by that glacial period which, driving the Polar plants into lower latitudes, left them stranded in these uplands when the ice cleared away, and the world resumed its wonted aspect.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-01-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_01_1888#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Recent Explorations in the Cameroons Interior', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'With regard to the orographical and hydrographical conditions of the formerly unknown portion of the region traversed, the country from the Cameroons up to Barombi station rises only about 1,000ft., and from there stretches away in gently undulating hills of about equal height up to the edge of the West African plateau. Here there is a sudden rise of 4,000ft. Up to the country of the Bali the ground falls but little, and it then slopes away to the north-west, particularly in South Adamawa. At Takum the traveller emerges from a mountain range, which stretches from the north-east south of Yola; west of Takum extensive plains follow each other down to the Binué. The grass land in the Bali region is treeless and fairly hilly; only in the valleys of the water-courses is bush country found. In the other parts of the grass lands traversed the savanna is characterised by small trees of about 20ft. high, stunted by the grass fires. These trees at times grow so thickly that they offer a welcome shade for the otherwise sun-scorched lands of Adamawa. The river valley of the Calabar reaches right up to the foot of the West African table-land. The Katsena-allah has a north-easterly direction, and is separated from the Calabar by the border lands of the plateau regions. The mountain chains, mostly composed of crystalline slates, have a general run from south-east to north-west, with transverse valleys running north and south. The mountain outlines in the southern portion of this region are mostly roundish; but in Adamawa proper there is an abundance of sharp, jagged formations, and huge rock pyramids, cones, and crests projecting 300ft. above their surroundings continually meet the gaze. Alluvial iron ore is plentiful, and the iron industry among the Bali is in a highly developed condition. The country is poor in many places between Yola and Gashka, where the laterite and disintegrated quartz occupy extensive wastes, which vividly recall the lands bordering on the Lower Congo. The interior of the Cameroons is much poorer than East and South Africa, although not barren. The elephant is the chief characteristic of the country. Antelopes are numerous in the lowlands of the Binué; monkeys and chimpanzees are plentiful in the deserts to the south of Takum, where the tracks made by them are often very similar to the native paths, and on many occasions led the expedition astray. The abundance of domestic animals in the interior—great buffaloes, maned sheep, and fowls—is in great contrast to the poor condition of the cattle-rearing industry in the West African coast regions, and the same can be said of Adamawa. There is no special distinction between the population of the primeval forest districts and that of the grass lands, although the latter is decidedly more developed and freer; it is as if the boundlessness of the savanna reflected itself in the people inhabiting it. All the negro races in the interior of the Cameroons are fully medium-sized—indeed, among the Bali, for example, the traveller meets with well-proportioned herculean figures. In the forest regions and among the Bali clever frisure of the hair are customary; the men in Adamawa mostly have their heads clean shaven, while the women have a great preference for towering chignons. The Bali place great value upon oblong skulls and endeavour to shape the heads of newly-born children accordingly—a peculiarity which is very seldom met with in Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1890#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.631, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICA AND ITS TRADE POSSIBILITIES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'On Feb. 13, an interesting lecture, entitled ""A Naturalist on the Mountains of the Moon,"" was delivered at the Royal Institution, Liverpool, under the auspices of the Liverpool Geographical Society, by Mr. G. F. Scott Elliot. The lecture was followed with much interest as an exposition from an authority on the subject. Mr. Scott Elliot, by his recent visit to Ruwenzori, has afforded additional information about this magnificent range of mountains in Central Africa, and his treatment of the subject was graphic and most informing. The address was made the more interesting by a series of limelight views. After touching on the character of Africa generally, the lecturer proceeded to give an account of the mountain Ruwenzori, the various difficulties in climbing the primeval forest, its inhabitants, the bamboo zone, the peat mosses, and the various tribes round the mountain. The occurrence of recent volcanic craters, and the manner in which the cloud hangs over the mountain all day long, only disappearing about sunset, was fully illustrated by slides from photographs taken by the lecturer. The lecturer described his experiences. Leopards attacked his camp, and very nearly killed two of his porters. A woman was carried off by a lioness, and he vainly attempted to rescue her. Elephants were extremely abundant round the mountain. The Natives were usually friendly, though the difficulty of obtaining supplies was often considerable, and on one occasion three of his men were attacked by them, and one very severely wounded. His march to the South was one of extraordinary difficulty, as his caravan consisted only of fourteen men, and the people were in places extremely unfriendly, and on one occasion attacked his porters. The future value of these little-known regions was shown by him to depend mainly on three factors—First, the natural wild resources, as rubber, palm oil, minerals, and ivory; secondly, the prospects of plantation by Europeans; and thirdly, the health of Europeans. The country between 3,000 and 5,000 feet had been proved to be valuable for plantations of coffee and tobacco. It is only in Africa above 5,000 feet that there is any possibility of a real colony being formed. The lecturer expressed his opinion that with the knowledge we have now of these parts, the Masai Highlands certainly appear to be quite healthy enough for Europeans to live and bring up children; but that so far there is no sufficient inducement for colonisation at present. Then, turning to the needs of Great Britain at the present time, he suggested that the three main requisites at present were—first, that our imports of food and raw material should come from our own Colonies; secondly, new markets; and thirdly, an outlet for our capital and population, both of which were unnaturally locked up in Great Britain. These new countries were, according to him, exactly adapted to answer those three urgent necessities.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1896#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.61, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE GOLD MINES OF THE GOLD COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Although a long period has elapsed since the riches of this portion of West Africa have been known to Europeans, it is only in the last few years that the nature of its auriferous formations has been at all understood.

After a hearty welcome by our host, we soon broached the object of our visit, and claimed the fulfilment of his offer.

Nothing would move him to go on the morrow, so we had to await the appointed time in much fear lest it was simply a put-off.

In half-an-hour the rain increased and for some hours it drenched us, whilst we ascended as rough a mountain track as you can well conceive. Towards mid-day we reached the place at which we had been stopped, and turned back on our journey over the mountains. Here our guide desired us to stay, as we were also so thoroughly drenched, but, with a recollection of the previous difficulties, I would on no account agree; and insisted on our passing on. We rested about twenty minutes, and made a start again, when the old chief stopped us and called our guide away to talk. In a little time our guide came trembling, and said it was no use trying to go on; we must go back. ""No, no,"" said my interpreter and myself simultaneously, ""we are not going back."" And after the interpreter telling the old chief that he had vexed us before and he had better not vex us again, we pushed our guide on, and tried to encourage him by the way. We walked at a rapid pace for about four hours more, sometimes passing straggling houses, but for the most part through wild uninhabited country.

F. Scott-Elliot, who accompanied the Anglo-French Boundary Commission to Sierra Leone, has prepared a report to the Colonial Office, on the botany and geology of that Colony. Mr. Scott-Elliot says that this country seems to be everywhere underlaid by a gneissose or granitoid rock, varying in appearance from a coarse red or gray granite to a foliated gneiss. This rock appears on the seacoast at Sierra Leone, and forms the tops of most of the higher plateaux: thus the Sugarloaf at Sierra Leone consists of a rock of this nature, and it also forms the broad watershed between Fulaba and Farana, which separates the Scarcies, Rokelle, and Niger drainage areas. This rock, though common and apparently fundamental everywhere, is not often seen on the surface. Almost the whole of the country between the sea level and 2,000 feet is covered by varieties of a reddish laterate or iron-pan, sometimes hard and barren, but usually porous, easily worked, and of a fertile nature. On the top of Mount Kofin he found a thick band of horizontal sandstones, which struck him as being similar to the so-called Nubian sandstones seen about Wady Halfa, on the Nile. There is also a very well-marked dolerite or basalt flow in the north-west corner of the English sphere of influence, traces of which were found at Wallia and Buyabuya, on the Scarcies River, and which forms a dyke twenty to thirty miles long, on the summit of the hills about Ninia and Duunia in the Talla country. In the immediate neighbourhood of this flow there are some much hardened slates or argillites, and the country is especially fertile where fragments of this dolerite are mingled with gneiss and sandstone. The dolerite itself is used by the natives as hones for sharpening knives, &c. The only mineral of importance is iron, of which the country contains a very large amount. There is a peculiarly rich belt of titaniferous iron ore in the hills behind Sierra Leone. Judging from the colour there would seem to be a very large amount of iron in the country. It is not at all unusual to find the smelting places of the natives in certain districts. In other respects the country seems destitute of mineral wealth, though Mr. Elliot could not speak with any certainty. The soil, so far as the Commission saw, could be roughly grouped into three classes. First, that of the plateaux and hills about 2,000 feet, or sometimes descending to 1,000 feet, which is due to the disintegration of gneiss or granite rocks. Second, the red laterite, which covers the lower hills from the sea level to 1,000 or 2,000 feet. Third, the alluvium, due either to the action of the mangroves along the coast, or to the rivers and streams inland.

The Phoenicians treated the part of Africa which they colonised as the British would, as the foundation of trade and commerce. The Phoenicians were followed, about 650 B.C., by the Greeks, who founded their first African colony Cyrene, on the coast of Tripoli. Then came the Carthaginians. They and the Greeks carried on a busy commerce all along the Mediterranean coast, far down to the Atlantic coast, to the mouth of the Red Sea. These were followed by the Romans, who continued an active career on the African coast until the decay of the Roman Empire.\n\nMr. Scott Keltie showed how little was known of the interior of Africa up to 150 A.D. by Ptolemy\'s map being thrown on to the sheet in the darkened theatre. This map, which was filled up haphazard fashion, gathered up, the lecturer said, all the knowledge of the continent which had accumulated during this long period of commercial activity — a knowledge which amounted to very little beyond the coasts and the Nile Valley. The next important period dealt with was the period of Arab invasion and the spread of the tenets of Mohammedanism — namely, from the seventh to the fifteenth century. In the early part of the fifteenth century commenced the ""glorious"" period of Portuguese activity, which lasted for some sixty years, during which the contour of the coast of Africa was completely laid down. This began the real modern partition of Africa, and the lecturer dwelt upon the effect which could be traced to Portuguese occupation of African territory — that occupation being marked by ruin rather than by enterprise. He rapidly traced the occupation of points of territory by Portuguese, Spanish, French, English, Dutch, Danish, and Germans, whose commerce was in ivory and slaves. He held that the opening up of the continent of Africa might be said to have begun with Bruce\'s travels in Abyssinia in the latter part of the eighteenth century. From that time until 1850 nearly the whole map of Africa became gradually filled up, and from 1850 down to the present day the southern half of the continent had received increasing attention at the hands of explorers until it also had had its main features laid down.

Existing climatic data permit only the most general conclusions about the nineteenth century: little more can be said than that the century did not witness catastrophes such as those of the middle seventeenth and eighteenth centuries or the Sahelian droughts of 1911-14 and 1969-73; that the early nineteenth century, despite the absence of severe drought except in the Chad basin in the 1830s, was drier on the average than the period 1600-1800; and that moist conditions returned between 1870 and 1895 but deteriorated towards the end of the century and culminated in the drought of the early twentieth century.$^{40}$ These general statements obviously mask a plethora of local and regional variation.

Little rain falls, and even that is extremely unevenly distributed in time and space, so that in the most arid parts of the desert some locations may not have had rain for ten years or more. The desert is driest in the central portions and especially in the eastern central desert, in present-day Egypt and eastern Libya. Three 'bridges' of higher than average rainfall traverse the central, dry portions of the desert from north to south, the first joining Senegal to Morocco slightly inland from the drier Atlantic coast, the second connecting the Niger bend to Algeria, and the third following the high ground bordering on the Red Sea.

Precipitation increases with altitude up to a certain height, and the landform of the Sahara has as many nuances as does its climate. After rains, formerly dry river beds or wädts may flow for hundreds of kilometres, and for great distances just under the surface of the sand. In some cases irrigated agriculture is possible because of the high water table. In areas of dunes called ergs the sand itself holds great quantities of moisture; dunes absorb almost all rainfall and give off very little water to underground aquifers. In addition, the sand loses moisture to the atmos› phere very slowly, since drifting exposes only the windward surface of the dunes. 2"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The nineteenth-century Islamic revolutions in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The setting for the drama that was to unfold in nineteenth-century West Africa was that corridor known to classical Arab geographers and historians as Biläd al-Südän (Land of the black people).

Furthermore, the region had become, since ancient times, an international market where local merchandise and foreign imports were exchanged.

It was the region where great states and empires rose and fell, a region that represented the earliest dar al-Islâm (abode of Islam) in West Africa.

Sedentary or semi-sedentary people have often assimilated nonkin who migrated to their territory, and in these societies residence in the same territory may replace kinship as a principle of association. Even societies that are organized according to descent may have leaders or councils at various levels in the segmentary structure or distributed throughout it; wealthy men may attract followers who are not kin; or alliances may contradict or partially offset the notion of kinship as a determinant of allegiance.\nAnother similarity among Saharan people was hierarchical social struc- ture, a consequence of the power of warriors to concentrate wealth so as to reinforce their own position of dominance.

Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.606, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Ethiopianism', 'content': ""In West Africa, however, the educated elite did not stop short at political action.

The pioneers of this revolution in West Africa were undoubt› edly James Africanus Horton (1835-83) and Edward Wilmot Blyden (18321912). Among the works of Horton on the themes in question were Political Economy of British Western Africa, with the requirements of the several colonies and settlements: An African view of the Negro place in Nature (1865); West African Countries and Peoples: A Vindication of the African Race (1868); and Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast (1870). In West African Countries and Peoples, Horton refuted the idea of inherent racial inferiority of the black man by arguing that the difference in the stages of civilization between whites and blacks arose 'entirely from the influence of external circumstances'. To those who moved from the assump› tion of racial inferiority of the black to the assumption that he would ultimately disappear from the face of the earth in the face of white power, Horton argued: we find that wherever the African race has been carried to ... they increase, no matter under what depressing and burdensome yoke they may suffer; from which it may be safely inferred that the African people is a permanent and enduring people, and the fancies of those who had determined their destruction will go in the same limbo as the now almost defunct American slavery. 40 Finally, in answer to the proposition that the black was incapable of improvement, he argued: 'Africans are not incapable of improvement, but that by the assistance of good and able men they are destined to figure in the course of time, and to take a prominent part in the history of the civilized world'.$^{41}$ Again in his Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast, Horton wrote in the Preface: Horton not only condemned racism but was also one of the earliest advocates of pan-Africanism.

Many European critics of colonialism, sympathetic to African protest, nevertheless also accepted that Africans had little in their 'traditional' patterns of thought which helped them to come to an effective or practical response to attacks on their way of life. The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ...

It was a beautiful and interesting sight, thousands of flying stars flying through the clear sky, all in the same direction, N.E. to S.W., horizontally, not very high over the earth. Their visible course varied from ten to forty degrees of length; the former only resembling a slight stroke of a match in a dark room, the latter partly attaining a great brightness, far exceeding that of Venus, and gradually dying away, but without any sound.

On the 17th of March last, a most destructive drought, which had continued for many months throughout the Accra districts—I do not here include the entire eastern districts, but the Accra districts only, situated between the rivers Sekenn and Volta—was happily broken up by a fine shower of rain, which was followed by other showers at intervals until the 13th of May. They then ceased until the 16th of June, when a light shower fell. We then had no more rain until the 31st of July, and then only a light shower. There has, in fact, been no proper rainy season in the Accra districts this year, and the consequence has been a failure of all the crops of corn, yams, cassada, ground-nuts, &c., which were growing near the Coast. This will probably occasion a great scarcity of food among the Coast populations about the end of the year.\n\nThis irregularity of seasons is doubtless connected with what may be termed our earthquake atmosphere, which evidently still continues to exist. There have been two very distinct shocks of earthquake here during the past three weeks; the latter shock occurred on Saturday morning last, the 1st inst.\n\nYou are doubtless aware that tropical Africa, or rather I should say torrid Africa, abounds in ants throughout all its forests and cultivated tracts, and that they construct monster ant-hills, rising frequently to ten or twelve feet in height, or even more, and having many of them a singularly castellated aspect. Since the great earthquake in 1862, which was so destructive to the houses in the Accra capital, these millions of ants have almost entirely disappeared from the western parts of the Accra districts—that is, they are not now found as usual on the surface of the ground, and are probably down some way under the surface. They partially appeared during some showers of rain last year, but they are now entirely out of sight; and the traveller may now walk for many miles without seeing one train of ants crossing his path. This singular fact has probably some connexion with our present earthquake atmosphere and influences.\n\nThe drought still continues, with the sun's rays extremely powerful and parching during the middle part of the day, and the nights unusually cool. Occasionally a strong breeze blows from the south-west, so intensely cold for this climate, that a fire becomes agreeable.\n\nIt is frequently the case that the latter rains commence here towards the end of September, and continue through October; should it so happen this year, it will be a great benefit to the country, and enable the farmers to grow a crop of corn, and other vegetable food; but should the latter rains also fail us as the former have done, there will necessarily follow a great scarcity of food, and much suffering among the people.—Yours sincerely,"", 'last_edit_date': '1866-09-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1866#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.624, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New Work by Dr. Africanus Horton, S.A.S.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Dr. Africanus Horton's work on the Climate and Meteorology of the West Coast of Africa has been published since our last number.

It is true that some of the officials that had been sent to the Gambia suffered much on account of the climate, but many of them (without disrespect) took advantage of the unfavourable report of the West Coast. We saw in the African Times of May 23rd, 1873, that Mr. Quin and others had an interview with the Earl of Kimberley about the affairs on the West Coast, but we were surprised to see that the Administrator, O\'Callaghan, ""had been compelled by ill health to resign."" We admit that Colonel Anton\'s health was totally ruined, which was the cause of his death; but if the life he led there had been closely watched, the authorities would not have come to the conclusion that he was affected by the climate. When the Administrator arrived here and saw the defenceless state of the Gambia, he thought of organizing a kind of Volunteer force; but this was without success. In fact, Mrs. O\'Callaghan was so very much dissatisfied and frightened at the place, that she would be extremely alarmed on hearing the report of a gun, and even the rumbling of carriage wheels. We were very much dissatisfied when we heard that his Excellency, who was stouter than when he entered the Gambia, was ordered home because of ill health, not knowing that he was looking out for another post. He even promised that he would report the state of the settlement on his arrival in England, that measures might be taken to rectify every defect in the place. We could show many instances to prove that our climate is not so unhealthy that Europeans could not live twenty-eight, thirty, forty-four, and even fifty-five years in it. Messrs. Goddard, Brown, Robertson, Chown, Quin, and Chief Justice Mantell are living testimonies of this settlement. The first of these gentlemen was a merchant who amassed a fortune; he lived in Bathurst a period of about fifty-five years, returned home, and died at the age of seventy-eight. The second, who is now in Bathurst, carrying on an extensive business, has been here for forty-four years, and his health, we venture to say, is improving every day. The third, who was the Colonial Surgeon and afterwards Secretary, resided in this settlement for thirty years, and has now retired to Scotland. The fourth, who was a merchant, took a residence in this place for twenty-five years, and returned home with a fortune. The fifth was of the same calling, resided here for the space of twenty-two years, made his fortune, and has taken his abode in England. The Chief Justice, also, stationed in this colony for twenty-eight years, is now holding a situation as a magistrate in England. Lawyer Montague, Smith and others are living testimonies of ""unhealthy"" Sierra Leone. There are others who might have been testimonies on behalf of the West Coast, but many of them died accidentally. We may therefore come to the conclusion that the climate on the West Coast is not altogether unhealthy.

But we have been subject to such misrepresentations when combating stereotyped misstatements as regards West Africa, that we will not allow any one to misunderstand us. The opinions we put forward with regard to the climate of West Africa have not been hastily or crudely formed, nor have they been adopted to serve some temporary or interested purpose. They are the result of evidence that cannot be disproved. They are promulgated by us to remove prejudices which war against our efforts for the advancement of civilization in Africa, and because we feel that they are pregnant with most practical results. We do not, for instance, pretend that the West African climate is not unhealthy. We admit that it is. But we as fearlessly contend that it is not one whit more unhealthy for Europeans than many of the West India Islands, or than Hong Kong, China, or India, &c. These regions are equally liable to visitations of epidemic disease as is West Africa, in the shape of yellow fever, dysentery, &c. We are, moreover, firmly convinced that if ever the day arrives when complete, and not mere partial statistical tables, are compiled, showing the mortality amongst Europeans at the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and even the new settlement at Lagos, the facts fairly and impartially revealed will demonstrate that at least a moiety of the deaths which occur amongst them are not the result of climatic disease, but are chargeable occasionally to accident; more frequently to a lamentable and wanton neglect of ordinary care and precautions; and too often to reckless indulgences, which will in any climate sap the springs of life, and ultimately destroy it. As additional evidences in support of these statements, take, for example, the records with regard to the numerous governors who have served, or are now serving, in West Africa. We find that in most instances they were and are men who had passed middle life before being called upon to administer those Governments, and were consequently far less able to bear up against attacks of fever. Yet, of the thirty-four gentlemen who have governed Sierra Leone from 1792 to 1864, seven only died there in that long period of seventy-two years. Of those seven, one was killed in action, another veteran most unwisely made fruit and vegetables his sole diet; and one of them had previously lived upwards of thirty-five years in the colony, dying at sea, not of disease incident to the climate, but of cancer of the stomach.

We make these remarks by way of introducing to more general notice the papers above noted, because they supply much valuable and novel information, not only regarding the diseases to which Europeans and natives are subject in West Africa, but because they furnish an interesting description of the topography of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.\n\nMr. Clarke is of opinion that the climate of West Africa, if fairly tested, can stand comparison in point of healthfulness with most of our colonies in the East or West Indies, where endemic and epidemic fevers, dysentery, with cholera to boot, prevail quite as frequently and fatally. There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years. Comparatively, their number is not small, comprehending persons of all classes—governors, civil and military officers, merchants, and missionaries, with their wives and families.

Yes, here is new evidence of the fact, that the denunciations hurled by the families of victims, and by journalists ignorant in these matters, upon the climate of certain portions of the globe under British rule or power, in which British soldiers, sailors, and civilians have to serve, ought rather to be heaped on the authorities who so unnecessarily and wantonly sacrifice the lives of their fellow-subjects and fellow-servants.

I could give you a list of a dozen or more personal friends, mostly traders, who have been on this Coast from ten to twenty years each, and are still strong, healthy men: it is true they have occasionally visited Europe during that time. Many young men shorten their lives by excess, carelessness, and exposure; *but I doubt if they would live long anywhere if they led such dissipated lives as they do here.* ""Climate"" is a common slang term for ""brandy,"" and is frequently employed ironically in that sense, because it is so much the fashion to attribute every death to ""that horrid climate,"" when those better informed know that a large proportion of Europeans hasten their own end by drink. One officer included among the victims of the Ashantee war was found dead in his bed, with a brandy bottle, nearly empty, under his pillow—at least, so ill-natured people said. Another victim of the said war died of epilepsy at Lagos, poor fellow! in fact, the ""war"" had to bear the blame of every death occurring among the troops at the time.\n\nThe much-abused traders, or ""palm-oil ruffians,"" as naval and military *gentlemen* politely term them after eating their dinners, drinking their wine, and perhaps winning their money, certainly undergo as many hardships and privations on many parts of the Coast as do their countrymen of the red coat and blue jacket; but by care and avoiding dissipation they manage to weather the ""climate"" for many years. I do not, however, wish to make any invidious comparison between the two classes; there are sober and steady, as there are dissipated and debauched, of each; how, then, is it the trader survives when the officer succumbs? Perhaps he who has escaped from the ""jaws of death"" (as I have done also several times) would say it is the consolatory hope of reaping ""pecuniary benefit."" It is at any rate somewhat strange that the traders who cannot run away from their business every time they are attacked by fever or dysentery should live, when the officer, who generally experiences little difficulty in getting invalided, should die. And I think this fact is a strong argument against those who abuse the traders and say they kill themselves with drink. One of the foremost in the rank of those who revile the traders was a certain ""young man about town,"" who came to ""flame"" in the ""virgin forest,"" ""kiss pretty savages,"" &c., and who experienced nothing but kindness and hospitality at the hands of the traders whom he met.

The walls of their dwellings are rarely, if ever, whitewashed, and are often crowded, ill-ventilated, and dirty. Most of the rooms are miserably small, dark, damp, and badly ventilated, especially those devoted to sleep. In their sleeping places the poorer classes, and many persons in better circumstances, keep all the dirty clothing not in wear either about their beds or hanging from the wall, scraps of food and putrid fish being strewed about or collected in corners. The lower rooms open into inner courts, where, in fine weather, the members of the several families meet, and where they often cook and eat their food. The houses of what may be termed the middling class are well furnished with European articles of cabinet furniture, with crockery, glass, and mirrors, while the walls are decorated with cheap prints. The wealthy native gentlemen (living in the seaboard towns) live in well-built houses, commodiously, and often elegantly, furnished; but few of them have fireplaces in the public rooms or bedrooms—a want which impairs health in a country exposed to heavy night-dews, and in some wet seasons to heavy falls of rain. The general custom on the Gold Coast is to burn charcoal in clay pots in the public rooms and bedrooms when the weather is damp or cold. From inquiries I have made, I find that twenty may be safely reckoned the average number of tenants living under one roof in the two-storied houses in Cape Coast, and it often happens that sober, decent people dwell in one apartment, and a drunken man in the next, for I regret to say that drunkenness is a wide-spread vice among the natives—a circumstance chiefly dependent upon the cheapness of the spirits imported from the United States, Holland, and the Brazils.""\n\nAnd again:—\n\n""The mass of the inhabitants bury their dead in the basement floor of their houses—a practice not confined to the pagan part of the population, but also practised by many respectable and wealthy families.

When the deceased is wealthy, valuable articles, as gold ornaments, gold dust, aggrey beads, are placed in the coffin, and the body is sprinkled with gold dust. These tombs in this way become family banks, and in the time of trouble the gold so deposited is applied to meet pressing claims or other family purposes.

The invasion of wetter, tropical Africa by cultivated crops was less successful, although the locally domesticated yam was rain-tolerant and grew well enough on the forest margins as did the West African variety of rice. Early in the Christian era plants more suited to equatorial Africa, the banana (especially its large non-sweet variety, the plantain) and the Asian yam reached East Africa and slowly spread westward.$^{36}$ But the conquest of the forest was a long slow process and agriculture and population grew slowly within its confines, so slowly indeed that up to the fifteenth century the forested northerly part of the Congo basin seems to have been sparsely occupied by hunters and food-gatherers and considerable areas are still occupied by these people. 37 In terms of demographic history, the important point is that the forest was the home of very few people five hundred years ago. The major exceptions were the fringes, the coast and the important inter-regional routes. For instance in Nigeria an example of the first is the lagoon area either side of Lagos, of the second is Old Oyo, and of the third is both Ife and Benin on the route which crosses the Niger at the lowest point where it is easily accessible and crossable before reaching the delta.

To take another Nigerian example, and a contemporary one, the opening up of the wet forest south of Ondo (and to the south-east of the massively crowded central Yorubaland) to intensive cultivation has largely been a product of the building of the road from Ijebu Ode to Benin in the early 1960s.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia: socio-cultural developments, 1915-35', 'content': ""the hardship and lash of slavery in the New World: Brought here the civilization, education and religion that were to be imparted to the natives and with these it was hoped that the two elements would build a great solidified and united nation ...

According to Logan, the pre-Aryan civilisation of Southern India had a partially Egyptian character. The oldest races, he asserts, were of a variable African type which spoke languages allied to the African. Egypt, and not India, is the common cradle of all we have in common, east, west, north, and south, all round the world. The languages, beliefs, rites, laws and customs went out to India, but did not return thence by means of the apocryphal Aryan migrations. The Indian affinity with our European folk-lore and fairyology is neither first nor final, \'tis but the affinity of a collateral relationship.

Scott Keltie, F.R.G.S., gave the first of a series of three lectures on the ""Geography of Africa, with special reference to the exploration, commercial development, and political partition of that continent."" The lecture was illustrated by maps.\n\nMr. Scott Keltie began by remarking that during the past six years we had seen the bulk of a great continent parcelled out among a few great Powers. That continent was no new discovery. It was not a new world like America or Australia. It entered into the oldest traditions and the most ancient history. Long, indeed, before Greece entered the field, while yet Europe was the home of wandering barbarians, long even before Abraham left his father\'s fields, before the Phœnicians had settled themselves on the Syrian coast, one of the most wonderful civilisations on record had begun to work out its destiny on the banks of that Nile, the mystery of whose source, so long sought for, had been solved only within present memory. It was not the present business to discuss the origin or trace the history of Egypt. It was enough that the continent on which the oldest, or at least one of the oldest, civilisations was born and was developed through thousands of years, was even now less known than a continent discovered only 400 years ago, and had only during the last few years been taken seriously in hand by the peoples who had the making of the world\'s commerce and the world\'s history. It was only just 400 years since Columbus stumbled upon the New World, and yet what was in brief the history of America? It was now the home of 130,000,000 of people of European origin. It was, indeed, another Europe. The first British colonial settlement was planted in Australia little more than a century since, and it was only fifty years since that the continents there had had a free hand. Now they had 4,000,000 of people of European origin, mainly of British descent, whose trade was of the value of £120,000,000 sterling a year.\n\nThis was to be contrasted with what had taken place in Africa. The lecturer then proceeded to trace the progress of the knowledge of the African continent among those whose interests and enterprise had extended beyond their own homes.

After the first violence to which fanaticism prompted, the Saracen sway assumed a milder aspect, and their princes cultivated the arts and sciences with a zeal which had expired among the effeminate descendants of the Greeks and Romans. Not only did they establish splendid literary institutions in Egypt, one of which at Alexandria is said to have had 600 professors, but even Mauritania, which seemed doomed to perpetual barbarism, became a civilised empire, and its capital, Fez, became a distinguished school of learning. They founded several flourishing kingdoms in those parts of the continent which Europeans vainly sought to reach, till they were recently explored by their enterprising countrymen. Of these states Shana (Kanoh of Dr. Barth) was the most prosperous, forming the great market for gold, in search of which merchants repaired from the remotest regions. Its sovereign was acknowledged supreme by all the neighbouring princes; while his court displayed a splendour hitherto unknown in those regions. The vicissitudes of fortune, however, have subverted the kingdom of Shana, and made it tributary to Timbuctoo, Kashna, and Socatoo. Dr. Barth, a few years since, found it a considerable town, with the name of Kano, manufacturing 600 thick cotton sheets a-year.\n\nTocrur was the centre of another kingdom. It was inferior to the other, but powerful. It carried on trade with people in the remotest west, who brought shells and brass in return for gold ornaments. Mention is made of cotton cloths also made here. This is most probably the modern Saccatoo, now the most important town in central Africa. Indeed, Major Denham, in an official document, called this the empire of Takror.\n\nKuku, to the east of Shana, forms another kingdom, on whose power and extent the Arabian writers largely dilate. The sovereign is said to have a large train, and the merchants to be very rich and accustomed to hold intercourse with the nobility. This country is evidently modern Bornou, from its capital, which still bears the same appellation.\n\nTo the south of Shana lay Wangara, a district said to abound in gold. This region is said to be intersected and overflowed by branches of the Niger, which impregnate the earth with the sand whence the precious metal is extracted. As soon as the waters have retired, the inhabitants eagerly dig the ground, and every one finds more or less, ""according to the gift of God.""', 'last_edit_date': '1866-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1866#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.612, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE PARTITION OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'most advanced of the Native States of the African continent, whose territory had been the prey of outside Powers, and he showed that the dawn of African exploration and partition commenced with the Phoenicians, who navigated the Mediterranean for an unknown period, and founded the city of Utica about 1,100 B.C., nearly 300 years before the foundation of Carthage. The Phoenicians treated the part of Africa which they colonised as the British would, as the foundation of trade and commerce. The Phoenicians were followed, about 650 B.C., by the Greeks, who founded their first African colony Cyrene, on the coast of Tripoli. Then came the Carthaginians. They and the Greeks carried on a busy commerce all along the Mediterranean coast, far down to the Atlantic coast, to the mouth of the Red Sea. These were followed by the Romans, who continued an active career on the African coast until the decay of the Roman Empire.\n\nMr. Scott Keltie showed how little was known of the interior of Africa up to 150 A.D. by Ptolemy\'s map being thrown on to the sheet in the darkened theatre. This map, which was filled up haphazard fashion, gathered up, the lecturer said, all the knowledge of the continent which had accumulated during this long period of commercial activity — a knowledge which amounted to very little beyond the coasts and the Nile Valley. The next important period dealt with was the period of Arab invasion and the spread of the tenets of Mohammedanism — namely, from the seventh to the fifteenth century. In the early part of the fifteenth century commenced the ""glorious"" period of Portuguese activity, which lasted for some sixty years, during which the contour of the coast of Africa was completely laid down. This began the real modern partition of Africa, and the lecturer dwelt upon the effect which could be traced to Portuguese occupation of African territory — that occupation being marked by ruin rather than by enterprise. He rapidly traced the occupation of points of territory by Portuguese, Spanish, French, English, Dutch, Danish, and Germans, whose commerce was in ivory and slaves. He held that the opening up of the continent of Africa might be said to have begun with Bruce\'s travels in Abyssinia in the latter part of the eighteenth century. From that time until 1850 nearly the whole map of Africa became gradually filled up, and from 1850 down to the present day the southern half of the continent had received increasing attention at the hands of explorers until it also had had its main features laid down. He referred in warm terms to the discoveries of Burton, Livingstone, and Stanley.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-04-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_05_1891#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.072, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Introduction and Progress of Mohammedanism in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Beyond the limits of their own empire the Romans had little communication with any people except the inhabitants of Fezzan and Nubia, and at a very late period with Abyssinia or the kingdom of Axum. Nor did Christianity seem to have extended her light far toward the centre, west or south of Egypt. Her benefits, spread over the north, disappeared here under the effects of disastrous wars. To Mohammedanism was reserved the task of effecting a change in Central Africa. The fanatic Arab mounted on the active dromedary, or embarked in light vessels, flew to plant the standard of his Prophet on the banks of Senegal and on the shores of Sofala. No people ever possessed such qualifications for conquering and preserving the empire of Africa. Among the Mauritanians and Numidians they found natural friends and brothers, and identity of manners, food, and genial climate. The fanatic Mussulman spirit astonished and subdued the ardent imaginations of the Africans; the simplicity of their creed suited their limited intellect, and easily connected itself with the superstition of fetishism, and the ideas which these people entertained of magic and enchantments. Civil slavery and despotic government suffered no change, except that the Maraboots, or Mussulman priests, and the shorifs, or descendants of the Prophet, formed in some of the states a species of aristocracy. Cannibalism was alone abolished. One event for a moment favoured the civilisation of the Moors—the expulsion of those of their number who had ruled in Spain, peopled Barbary, and even the oasis of the great desert with a more industrious and better-informed race than the rest of the Mohammedans. But unhappily for Africa, a handful of Turkish adventurers, vying with one another in ferocity and ignorance, established themselves on the coast of Barbary, subdued the Moors, and founded the barbarous governments of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, forming a deadly barrier to the civilised world, more efficient than Mohammedanism itself.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1866#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.61, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE PARTITION OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In concluding, he said that he had laid before them what had been done during the past 3,000 years by the various great Powers who had had dealings with Africa for its geography, commerce, and civilisation. Around its coasts had successively swarmed Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Vandals, Arabs, Portuguese, and various European nations. Until the Moslemised Arabs took it in hand there was no evidence that any enterprising peoples had crossed the Sahara, or, indeed, had ever gone beyond hail of the coast, except along the Nile Valley. It was only 460 years ago that Europe set herself to define the contour of the African coast. It was just about a century since Europe seriously set herself to the task of exploring the northern half of that continent and of discovering the course of the great River Niger. The Nile source was only reached some thirty-four years ago, and during the past thirty years more had been done to spread a knowledge of the continent than during the 3,800 years before. At last the great blanks had been filled up in all the main features. Only seven years ago the wholesale partition of the continent among the Powers of Europe had begun, and it would be instructive to inquire into the causes which had been at work to effect this action.\n\nAt the close Mr. Scott Keltie exhibited modern maps in contrast to the ancient ones, showing how rapidly of late years the knowledge of the Dark Continent had spread.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-04-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_05_1891#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.621, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Capabilities of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Dear Brother in the cause of God and humanity,—The elevation of Africa is near my heart, and anything that promises to aid in rescuing her from her long and deep degradation meets a warm response in my heart.

Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down. These things I have seen.\n\n3. And her minerals are rich and abundant. Gold and iron ore, the purest in the world, is very abundant in many parts.

Where the population was only sparse, that might be accounted for by the tribal warfare which prevailed, and which could be suppressed by the introduction of civilisation. What was wanted was that peace should be maintained, and trade encouraged, to raise the natives to a civilised condition. The native population was divisible into three great classes—the Arab, the Negroid, and the Negro. The Arab race they met from the Nile to the Zambesi, and in the Sahara, as well as about the Great Lakes. They were the merchants and the traders, while the Negroids were the occupiers and cultivators of the soil. It was singular that, while the Arab race had endeavoured to oust the British from the Soudan, they had assisted them at Zanzibar. It was difficult to deal with them, and it would not do to drive them out as the Moors had been driven from Spain. The best thing to do would be to make them useful in Central Africa, to deal with them as we found them, and to place in their way such commercial prospects that they might be induced to abandon the slave trade. If they once got the Arab to join them, they could easily put a stop to the butcheries of the negro races by each other. As to the Negroids, they were being gradually absorbed by the other two races. The most important race to the British Empire was the Negro, who was capable of being rapidly civilised. He could not raise himself unaided, and he still remained as he had been limned 4,000 years ago upon the Egyptian frescoes. Yet as soon as he was brought into contact with civilisation he took it up rapidly, and soon became a good clerk, an engineer, a cook, or domestic servant. The Negro was far less alien to our civilisation than the Chinaman, and in the course of about 300 years there would be very little difference between him and the European except the colour of the skin. They might be weaned from slave-dealing, man-hunting, the burning of witches, and the offering of human sacrifices, and he did not know of any African prince who could be accused of anything like the beheadings and the quarterings that took place in the reigns of Henry VIII., Mary, and Elizabeth, nor did he find that any native African priesthood had been guilty of one-tenth of the horrible cruelty which had been perpetrated in Europe under the name of religion.

If a great many of these albinoes were formed into a town, and propagation encouraged, a new race of people would be formed, which, but for the climate and domestic habits, would be as white as a Greenlander.\n\nWe suppose that of the early inhabitants of this globe one family, passing through the Isthmus of Suez, entered into Africa, another branch taking quite an opposite direction, and proceeding to the temperate zone, gave origin to a different and distinct race of men, who adapted themselves to the climates they inhabited, changing their tropical habits for others suitable to the climatorial influence of the temperate and polar zones; and thus, after the lapse of ages, forming the great Caucasian race. In like manner the Mongolian race has been also formed.\n\nThe difference in shape and peculiarity of configuration in the different races may be accounted for by the different domestic habits of each class of men, the manner in which their offspring are brought up, the degree of admixture between the different tribes and races, the difference in habitation, the degree of intellectual culture, the influence of the rites and ceremonies of the religious tenets which they hold, and last, but not the least, the different climatic influences which operate on each class.\n\nFrom the foregoing the reflective mind will at once perceive that the race which descended to Africa were subject to several vicissitudes, which had a most depressing effect on them, and which deprived them of that brilliancy which is shown by the other races, but who, after a change of their religion and the cultivation of their minds, endeavour to claim their position in the world's history. This displeases some of the Japhetic race, especially those residing in Africa, and they consequently use all their endeavours to crush them.\n\nIt can now be seen that, believing in the genuineness and authenticity of the most holy and most ancient Book, man, or the race which inhabits this globe, had one origin; that they were dark in colour, if not black; and that, having first peopled the track of land eastward of the Mediterranean, from their descendants, the Ethiopian, Caucasian, and Mongolian races proceeded."", 'last_edit_date': '1865-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1865#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.61, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}]",True

This process began with the accession of King Radama I, and was consolidated in the first half of the nineteenth century. The return of foreigners after 1861, and particularly the encouragement of foreign trade and cultural influences opened yet a new era for the Malagasy. The process of moder› nization involved embracing Christianity and instituting a series of reforms that were geared to mobilizing the human and natural resources of the country for greater development in the political, social and economic spheres. These reforms carried out by Malagasy leaders, particularly from the time of Radama IPs accession to the throne in 1861, were crucial in the evolution of Madagascar. In view of the persistent argument that Africa was colonized because of its poverty and lack of development, it is noteworthy that at least Madagascar, during the period under review, established important reforms which, as a British admiral observed in March 1881, had made the Malagasy 'a race fit to govern their land; and the fact obviated the necessity for the intervention of any outside nation'. 70 However, when the Scramble came, such developments did not shield Madagascar from the pressures of foreign intervention; in some ways, modernity had weakened the Kingdom;$^{71}$ in other ways, the reforms also strengthened the resistance that the Malagasy were able to muster."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.585, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Madagascar, 1880S-1930S: African initiatives and reaction to colonial conquest and domination', 'section_title': 'A country united by its submission to France and its opposition to colonial domination > From colonization to the dawning of the national movement', 'content': ""These economic changes and the political upheavals they engendered inevitably caused social and cultural transformations.

The first was the political evolution of the country and the diplomatic interaction between Madagascar and foreign powers, particularly Britain and France. Second, major changes took place in the social organization of the country, par› ticularly in the religious, administrative and economic fields. Political evolution consisted mainly of the consolidation of the Merina monarchy and the expansion of its authority to the rest of the island. The diplomatic relations that this monarchy maintained with both Britain and France became a cornerstone of the country's development. The changes that were effected in administration, particularly in the establishment of law and order, facilitated economic development. This was also a major factor in Madagascar's efforts to modernize itself and to resist foreign domination. The embracing of foreign religions was viewed as part of this process of modernization.\nA brief description of the country and its people may be necessary here. There are some eighteen ethnic groups in Madagascar of which the largest and, as it turned out, the most important in the nineteenth century, are the Merina who live on the central plateau of the island. This central plateau, known as Imerina (the country which one sees from afar), was the home of the Merina among whom there was a privileged class who came to rule the greater part of the island before it was colonized by the French. It is difficult to say what the population of Madagascar was during the period under review, but the British consul in Madagascar estimated it to be 5 million in 1865, of whom about 800 000 were Merina.$^{1}$ All the Malagasy groups speak the same language and have, with few exceptions, similar customs and religious traditions. Thus, despite the existence of regional differences, the Malagasy were, and have remained, one people, with one profound cultural and ethnic unity. 2"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.616, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': 'Nor is the \'traditional-modern\' polar model, with all its attendant implications of conflict and incompatibility, applicable to the entire spectrum of African experience of change under colonialism. There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure.

The students were joined by clerks and office workers and primary-school teachers.

Although the VVS was a clandestine organization, it expressed its opinions openly in the press by calling on the Malagasy to sacrifice themselves for their homeland, so that its people could advance and live in freedom and dignity. As the bearer of a national message, this secret society was an intolerable challenge to the administration, especially in wartime.

The bulk of the people were engaged in agriculture, primarily for the needs of their families, rice being the main food, especially on the central plateau of the island. The Malagasy had developed the planting of rice to such a high degree of specialization that one observer remarked 'that in few things is the industry and ingenuity of the Malagasy shown more than in the cultivation of rice.'64 Besides agriculture, the economy of Madagascar depended on the rearing of cattle, particularly among the Sakalava in the west and the people in the south of the island. Sheep and pigs reared on the central plateau, and fish, formed major food items among the Malagasy. The Merina were unable to control the trade on the west coast: in the southern part, they were virtually absent, and in the north-western part, they had to compete with the Antalaotra. On the eastern coast, however, they installed and controlled an efficient commercial network.\nThe Malagasy were experts in two main industries, spinning and weaving on the one hand, and mining and metallurgy, especially iron, on the other. They made cloth, and produced a variety of metal articles for their own use. These provided the basis for the technical education received from Europeans. We have already referred to the goods that were made at Laborde's factory at Mantasoa, about 35 km south-east of Antananarivo. Alfred Grandidier, the famous nineteenth-century French explorer of Madagascar, informs us that at Mantasoa: Laborde forged iron and made pure steel; cement, cannons and mortars; all sorts of arms and ammunition; tannery; glasses and earthenware; pottery; pots and plates; bricks and tiles; soap of all colours; candles, paper and ink; potash, alum; sulphuric acids; and, after 1843, raised Chinese silk-worms. 65 Many of these products ceased to be manufactured after Laborde left Madagascar in the late 1850s, but some of the men with whom he had worked were able to continue producing some of the goods necessary for their livelihood.

One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual.

In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

African dance, art, music and traditional religious systems held their own and such borrowings and adaptations as were made by Africans were not only selective but also, to borrow M. J.

Certainly, in these areas, many Christians did and still do retain their belief in their traditional gods.

Similarly, Oyo cultural influences found in eastern Yorubaland - worship of Sango, the spread of the men's loom, shoulder sling drums - must be considered not so much as evidence of Oyo hegemony before 1800 as of the nineteenth-century diaspora of the Oyo following the fall of the empire. 38 A similar influence from Benin, especially on court ceremonials, regalia and chieftaincy titles in Qwo, Ekiti, Akoko, Ondo, Ijesa - as among the Awori astride the present-day Nigeria-Benin border - showed the widespread effect of the theme of inter-group penetration and com› mensurate institutional adaptation.

Most of the caterpillars of the country cover themselves with silky envelopes, which protect them both from the inclemency of winter and the sudden showers of the summer season. Some are naturally covered from their birth with a thick mantle which grows with them, leaving only the head and legs uncovered. Others spin double and treble cocoons, and others again mix up various particles of plants with their silk, combining them artistically; and, lastly, there are some which spin a common nest, in which they live under a republican form of government, each individual spinning its own cocoon besides. The last number of the Bulletin de la Societe d'Acclimatation contains a curious paper on this subject by M. Auguste Vinson, of La Réunion. He states that the Hovas weave a kind of silk which they call landy; and is obtained from the worm that feeds on the leaves of the ambrevade, or Angola pea (Cytisus cajanus). This silk is heavy, and has no gloss, but is exceedingly strong. The natives sell the tissues they weave out of this silk very dear, and it is therefore only the rich who wear them. King Radama II., who dresses in the European fashion, wears trousers and a paletôt made of this silk, which, not being dyed, is of a grey colour, like unbleached linen. The wealthy are buried in shrouds made of this silk, and it is said that such shrouds entombed for centuries have been exhumed in a perfect state of preservation. The ambrevade being an indigenous plant of La Réunion,* this Madagascar silkworm might be easily introduced there. The insect is 45 millimetres long; its body is composed of 12 segments, and covered with black sharp horny points all over. The general hue is a chestnut brown, but the abdomen has a longitudinal rose-coloured streak between two other light brown ones. The cocoon is 70 millimetres in circumference, and 45 in length; it is very heavy, of a dirty grey colour, but interspersed with black bristles.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

Those who know anything of Madagascar history know the unpronounceable name of Andrianampoinimerina, who held sway from 1787-1810, and who brought much of the island to be subject to the Hova tribe. He had a favourite sister, Rahety by name, and it was at one time thought that her descendants might ultimately obtain the crown; but she gave birth to twins, and had no other issue. For fear, then, that the descendants of these two children should dispute as to their rights to the crown they were both put aside. In course of time one of these lines became extinct. As the late Queen lay on her death bed, very early in the morning of her death, a young girl of about twenty years was awakened out of her sleep in a house about a mile from the palace and taken at once into the presence of the dying Queen, who there and then named her as her successor, and exhorted her in some parting words to trust in the same God as she had trusted in. This young girl, Rajáfindrahety by name, was great-grand-daughter of the Rahety above spoken of. She was well educated in the schools of the Quakers in this city, and latterly in that of the London Missionary Society, and was, I am told, most promising and intelligent. There is another curious thing connected with it. Some three or four years ago she was married to a nephew of the late Queen. Little over two months ago, on May 7, her husband died. If this had not taken place it may be safely said that the girl would never have been Queen. The present Prime Minister would never have suffered any one to be Queen to whom he could not have had access, whether by night or day, and there is no doubt that very soon, even if it has not, as some say, already taken place, he will become the husband of the present Queen, and, unless prevented by the French, become far more powerful than he has ever yet been. Indeed, this is even now evident. For the first time in the history of Madagascar there has been not only no bloodshed, but not even commotion of any kind. The new Queen, under the title of Ranavalona III., has been accepted by the nation as their Sovereign.

The young unmarried ladies wore European dresses made in Spanish style. The daughters of Israel in Morocco, and especially in the northern parts, are very beautiful, and their complexion much fairer than one would expect. Many of them are well educated. Having chatted until five P.M., the ladies proceeded to another apartment to partake of green tea and sweets. At six the ladies made way for the gentlemen—the bridegroom being absent, according to custom, from the bride\'s house. The festivities were continued until eight, and the bride was then covered with the marriage veil, her head being surmounted by a white silk head-dress adorned with flowers. Her eyes were closed by her mother—custom observed, as a fair informant explained to me, \'por verguenza,\' otherwise the bride might feel bashful at meeting the gaze of the assembled company. After embracing her father, she was conducted to a spacious palanquin, and in this was carried, with her mother and sister, to her future home, where her intended husband awaited her. On arrival she was led to a seat on a daïs prepared in the apartment in which the ceremony was to be solemnised, her mother sitting on one side of her and the bridegroom\'s mother on the other.

THE COMMERCIAL OUTLOOK.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Commercially and industrially speaking, the coast of Madagascar may be divided into five great divisions. The first is the long stretch of east coast from Antongil Bay to Fort Dauphin, forming almost a straight line. It contains not a single really good natural harbour, nor a decently navigable river of any length, and most of its towns are only approached by dangerous roadsteads. From its geographical position it will easily be understood that its foreign element are mostly Mauritians. The natural resources of this coast have been to a great extent exhausted, and the prospects now lie principally in sugar-planting. The Mauritians are naturally acquainted with this industry, and there is a great future before them. Coffee is also a profitable undertaking, but it must not be planted at a lower elevation than 1,500 feet above the level of the sea. Spices of almost every kind can also be cultivated auxiliary to the sugar plantations. The second division is that called the North-east Coast, being that part between Antongil Bay and Cape Amber. It contains two or three harbours, but not very good ones. The forests here are much larger than in any other part, and consequently the natural supplies of India-rubber and gum-copal are still plentiful. This is the most thinly populated part of the island, but exceedingly fertile. Probably in a few more years the natural resources will be exhausted, and foreign residents will then have recourse to agriculture, with better results perhaps than can be obtained on any other part of the East Coast. The third division of the Coast is the North-west, from Cape Amber to Cape St. Andrew, and the part coveted by France. This part contains lignite deposits and valuable woods, and is full of good harbours. Its foreign element consists chiefly of Indians and Muslims, and a few French Creoles. The fourth division is the West Coast, properly called—i.e., from Cape St. Andrew North to St. Augustine South. Full of good harbours and navigable rivers, it is probably the finest part of Madagascar. The foreigners there are mostly Americans and Englishmen, who carry on a trade with the Cape and Natal. The fifth part is the Southern portion, from St. Augustine to Fort Dauphin, about which nothing is really known.\n\nIt will be seen, then, how little is yet known of the vast commercial resources of this island, and of the number of industries that may be opened. The trade of the last few months has been characterised by a little more activity, but at best can only be said to be very slack. The coast merchants are still prevented from exporting such articles as would afford supplies to the French armies, or were prevented up to a very short time ago. The wholesale trade in hides at Antananarivo has somewhat revived, but is far from satisfactory. Cottons are still high, and the American merchants are doing nothing.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-04-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1884#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.547, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Belgium and the New Congo State', 'section_title': '', 'content': '### WEST AFRICAN MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.\n\nA correspondent writes: In accordance with your request I send you the following explanations of some of the native manners and customs.\n\n1. **Marriage Ceremonies.**—The presentation of kola nuts in marriage signifies a wish that the couple may be united in one, even as the two divisions of the nut are united.

It might be said that we sold Egbo to them. This is true, but it was not for the purpose for which they are utilizing it. The weak and poor of our country have no protection now; whereas, formerly, the protection of property and person, the poor and the helpless, was sacredly regarded by our laws. And even when person and property were not considered safe enough, the late Consul Hopkins—the most generous-minded of all Her Britannic Majesty\'s representatives we have yet had—did much to ameliorate our condition, by an agreement which both European missionaries and merchants agreed to. Now our people are not only violating several articles of this compact, but the Europeans themselves, who signed it, assist in modifying the most stringent ones. The missionaries shut us out from the knowledge of things. It may be because we are Calabar; therefore we are not to be taught, and our children made happy by good instruction and better training. We doubt not that good people in Europe have our interest at heart. But, as the result of half European influence among us, we have become very degraded in morals; life and property are less safe than hitherto, and the weak and poor have no protection.

One might be surprised at the Consul\'s callousness, and ask, why was his attention not drawn to this treatment? The chief received this disgraceful treatment from his people simply for sheltering a poor, weak, and helpless woman who was shamefully wronged and maltreated by her divorced husband, and for endeavouring to redress her grievance. As the woman had appealed to the chief without getting any satisfaction, she was ultimately constrained to appeal to the Consul in writing ""knowing that, as an Englishman, and a representative of a country where the dignity of women is respected, he will go into the case, and mete out to the guilty one such punishment as his crime deserves.""

However, the textbook focuses more on cultural resilience and adaptation rather than explicitly linking these interactions to political legitimacy. In contrast, The African Times articles illustrate the involvement of both colonial officials and local populations in ceremonial events, such as the coronation banquet in Manjakamiadana and the review of the Houssa Armed Police in Lagos, reflecting a blend of colonial and indigenous practices. The presence of various social groups, including officials, clergy, merchants, and traders, underscores the maintenance of political legitimacy through ceremonial participation. The articles also highlight enduring cultural identity through traditional practices, such as the Egbo society in Old Calabar and marriage customs in West Africa, while acknowledging tensions and challenges to social cohesion, such as grievances against colonial policies and calls for changes in marriage customs among the Kaffirs.

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure. The point is that colonial Africans were probably not unaware of the elementary fact that accepting \'new forms [would] increase the range of alternatives\'$^{3}$ available to them.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': ""Though it has been correctly pointed out that it is difficult to group the different organizations into clear-cut categories, especially owing to their functional versatility, we shall here distinguish between three kinds. In the first group are those organizations which could be described as purely 'social', that is devoted to promoting conviviality and relaxation. These were made necessary by the absence from the towns of the traditional forms of amusement, relaxation and citizenship training - such as the masquerades, age-grade associations and traditional festivities. There was also the attraction of forms of modern European social life as advertised in the life of the European community in each colony. In this category were the football clubs, Scout and Girl Guide movements, debating societies and alumni associations.\nIn the second group are the ethnic unions. These were an extension of rural ethnicity to the urban areas. There were different hierarchies of them - village, clan and ethnic unions. These had two main functions. One was to help the individual who had migrated newly to the town to adjust as smoothly as possible to the conditions of urban life. Thus when a migrant first reached the town, he usually made his first contacts with members of his village or clan union who would help to find him accommodation, to introduce him to employers of labour or master craftsmen to teach him modern skills. They also taught him how to comport himself in the city. Through such associations members got help when in difficulty. They could get loans to continue their business if they sustained crippling losses. Funeral, marriage and other expenses approved by the association could also be met with loans or donations from the group as the case may be. ' ° The other function of the ethnic unions was 'to provide a channel for progressive public opinion at home', especially through maintaining an organized link between the sons at home and the sons abroad. To do this they had to take an interest in the political and social development of their homes. At first this won the associations the opposition and obstruction of suspicious colonial officials. In south-eastern Nigeria, for instance, where by the 1930s the colonial power was still toiling to entrench the idea of native authorities, the formation of these unions caused uneasiness in official circles.

Similarly, Oyo cultural influences found in eastern Yorubaland - worship of Sango, the spread of the men's loom, shoulder sling drums - must be considered not so much as evidence of Oyo hegemony before 1800 as of the nineteenth-century diaspora of the Oyo following the fall of the empire. 38 A similar influence from Benin, especially on court ceremonials, regalia and chieftaincy titles in Qwo, Ekiti, Akoko, Ondo, Ijesa - as among the Awori astride the present-day Nigeria-Benin border - showed the widespread effect of the theme of inter-group penetration and com› mensurate institutional adaptation.

At the other extreme were the Kololo immigrants, who established their ascendancy over the Manganja, but were totally absorbed into the sub- ordinate society.$^{91}$ Between these two poles were the more common examples of cross-fertilization leading, in some cases, to the formation of syncretic cultures. Even the vanquished Kololo left their impact on the Lozi, who adopted their language and important governmental institutions.$^{92}$ Within the Mpezeni kingdom, on the other hand, all the political elements of the new society were of South African derivation while non-political cultural elements such as land inheritance, marital patterns, female circumcision and language were heavily influenced by the indigen› ous Nsenga tradition.$^{93}$ This bifurcation is not surprising since the Mpezeni kingdom was controlled by political and military institutions designed to ensure the pre-eminence of the Nguni. Spatial and demographic con› siderations seem initially to have determined the extent of cultural bor› rowing within the Mbwela Nguni state; in the core of the kingdom where the Nguni were more numerous, the Tonga and Tumbuka adopted most aspects of the alien culture, but towards the outlying provinces the rate of borrowing diminished proportionately. This general pattern is complicated somewhat by the Nguni adoption of Tumbuka as the national language and the subsequent Tumbuka cultural renaissance, which suggests that many of the subject people only superficially adopted Nguni culture. 94 Although a discussion of the effects which the Mfecane had on the existing patterns of social stratification is conspicuously absent from the literature, fragmentary evidence suggests the growth of new classes within the Nguni kingdoms. During the expansive phase, a military aristocracy consisting of the regimental commanders and their principal subordinates emerged. Their power was based primarily upon the tribute and plunder which they acquired - especially the herds of cattle and captives, some of which they redistributed to their followers.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

They related to the social innovations that colonialism had introduced into the Somali social fabric. Colonial forces had, in fact, destroyed the traditional social and political institutions and imposed their own. They introduced in all parts of Somalia a centralized system of administration that vested all effective powers in the hands of colonial administrators, and gave no Somali any position of command except at the very lowest level. Colonial appointed chiefs, known as akils in the British Protectorate and capos in Italian-ruled Somalia, operated in an advisory capacity only, and as vehicles for colonial directives to the people. This was indeed a wide departure from the traditional free local institutions and the nomadic way of life to which the Somali people were overwhelmingly dedicated. With their fierce sense of independence and traditional disdain for all foreign elements, especially white Christians, the Somali people were bound to resist this radical innovation.\nBefore the colonial era, the Somali were not subject to government imposts other than qadi fees and import and export duties. But the colonial powers campaigned to mobilize and exploit all Somali resources - human and material - using their newly-appointed chiefs who had no regard for traditional authority. Direct taxes were instituted for the first time in Somaliland. While in Italian Somalia this took the form of an annual hut tax, in the Protectorate the British imposed taxes on lifestock. Moreover Somali labour was forcibly recruited for colonial enterprises. The French recruited 2000 Somali to work for them as manual labourers during the First World War. Of these, 400 were killed and another 1200 were wounded.$^{32}$ Italian administrators sent out frequent expeditions to provide the required labour for their plantations in Somalia. These Somali recruits were grouped according to their ethnic origins and forced to live in colonial villages on the consortiums.

Hence, champions of African nationalism in the inter-war period (wanasiasa as they are known in Swahili) have been referred to as being primarily panAfricanists rather than nationalists in the European sense. The point was that nationalism was taking a reverse course to the expression of the same phenomenon in Europe. Contrary to what happened in Europe, the state was created before the cultural nations that would make it a meaningful political community were welded together. It is in this sense that one should take James Coleman's observation that: ... the drive behind African nationalism in many instances is not the consciousness of belonging to a distinct politico-cultural unit which is seeking to protect or assert itself, but rather it is the movement of racially-conscious modernists seeking to create new political and cultural nationalities out of the heterogenous people within the artificial boundaries imposed by the European master ... '\nWe must recognize that colonialism, as a system of relations, rests upon some kind of racialism, and that since development in a colonial situation is a product of interactions between the colonizer and the colonized, racial consciousness is basic to the growth of nationalism as a search for sovereignty and independence.\nThat African nationalists are regarded as 'modernists' is a reflection of the fact that they were operating within an externally defined setting which imposed alien systems of values, norms, and definitions of political and social developments to which they had to subscribe as a condition for success. That nationalism in Africa is a dynamic, ongoing phenomenon is clear from the extensive literature on themes like nation-building and irredentism.

This was the signal for a demonstration of the most extraordinary character. The whole company rose _en masse_, shouted, screamed, jumped and yelled as only Africans can, and then the dancing began afresh and became general. The King-elect was attired in a robe of bright-coloured cloth, an admiral\'s worn-out hat, with a white feather sticking in it, covering his head. He carried a silver spear, and a live fowl, tied by the leg to a long string which his majesty held, fluttered on the ground before him. A brush of peacock\'s feathers, some five or six feet long, was suspended from his back to represent a tail. Some of the native costumes were ludicrous in the extreme. Discarded naval and military uniforms were the favourites, on account of their bright colours. Big negroes wore little coats, the sleeves of which did not reach further than their elbows, and they were tied with string in front to draw them close to the body; others again, of small stature, wore large coats, and the result was often that, when the collars were turned up, very little of the wearer\'s inside could be seen.

Its members are selected with very great care, and the main object of the organization is understood to be to obtain justice in their dealings with others.

About eleven o\'clock every night a horn is blown, which sounds all over the town, and on hearing this an ""Egbo man,"" with a bell tied to him, and with a number of followers attending him, starts to scour the whole place, and if anybody, be it man, woman, or child, is found abroad at that hour, they receive prompt punishment, and very often most serious personal injury is thus inflicted. As with secret societies in England, the Egbo men have their strict rules and regulations; the meetings are conducted with closed doors, and each member is sworn not to divulge anything of the proceedings. When the Egbo man referred to appeared at the dance, the upper portion of his body was encased in armour, and his legs were covered with elaborate bead-work; he wore a mask to conceal his features, and had a bunch of feathers behind him as a tail, to which was attached his bell, the sound of which, when he makes his nightly journeys, is so terrifying to the inhabitants.

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world.

There are some eighteen ethnic groups in Madagascar of which the largest and, as it turned out, the most important in the nineteenth century, are the Merina who live on the central plateau of the island. This central plateau, known as Imerina (the country which one sees from afar), was the home of the Merina among whom there was a privileged class who came to rule the greater part of the island before it was colonized by the French.

In Imerina, the vastly increased number of schools and the whole› sale recruitment of junior civil servants gave rise to dismay both in the ranks of the former oligarchy which had been deprived of its power by the conquest and among the new elite trained in the colonial schools, who gained the impression that they had been 'deliberately debarred from positions of responsibility by the colonial system'. 25 Thus, colonial oppression affected all the different levels of Malagasy society, even though its forms differed in the different regions, and it provoked different reactions."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Madagascar, 1880S-1930S: African initiatives and reaction to colonial conquest and domination', 'section_title': 'A country united by its submission to France and its opposition to colonial domination > From colonization to the dawning of the national movement', 'content': ""From the administrative standpoint, the colonial venture broke down the long-established political framework. In Imerina, GalliØni abolished the monarchy on 28 February 1897 and the privileges of the aristocracy on 17 April. Elsewhere, however, he did not abolish the different dynasties, at least not de jure. On the contrary, he started out by attempting, as the Minister had instructed him to do, to combat the Merina hegemony and to embark on the 'politique des races' which had earlier been tried out in the Soudan (French West Africa) and Indochina. Former sovereigns or their sons were accordingly brought into the administration as 'native governors', while 'internal protectorates' were created among the extensive kingdoms in the west and south-west. This system did not prove satis› factory, however, and from 1905 onwards the number of Merina assistants was increased to a disproportionate degree, since the Merina were regarded as being more suitable material for 'progress and adaptation' than the other peoples. Finally, GalliØni introduced French settlers (colons) and Asian immigrant workers into the new colony which greatly alienated the indigenous people. GalliØni's 'Franco-Merina synthesis' was extended to cover the entire island, its key features being the fokonolona, the village communities, considered as having collective responsibility for their affairs, and the corvØe or forced labour system, which was legally designated as the 'provision of services' in 1907 and was brought into general use between 1908 and 1915.$^{23}$ This entailed the defacto abandonment of the 'politique des races', the abolition in 1909 of the two regional schools on the coast, one at Analalava on the north-west coast and the other at Mahanoro on the east coast (the third was in Antananarivo) which had been set up by GalliØni as breeding-grounds for potential civil servants, and the phasingout of the 'internal protectorates'. The finishing touches were put to the territorial unification of Madagascar with three measures. The first was the standardization of the administration (between 1927 and 1932, three attempts were made to define the boundaries of administrative districts). The second was the widespread introduction of administrative fokonolona as the medium for the exercise of authority.

The Queen and the Andafiavaratra clan in particular and the oligarchy in general could adopt this attitude of resistance to foreigners because, despite sporadic revolts, they were in control ofthe most important provinces, whose economy they controlled, including a monopoly on the beef trade. In this lies their determination to continue to promote Western education and establish industries to produce those goods which they needed but which could not now be imported from outside. In maintaining commercial contacts with the outside world, the Queen used the services of a French national called de Lastelle, who was established at Tamatave, and an American national called William Marks at Majunga. With the support of de Lastelle, sugar plantations were established on the eastern coast, and a factory was installed at Mahela producing sugar and rum.31 The Queen engaged Jean Laborde, a French adventurer, who arrived in Antananarivo in 1832 'as a kind of general superintendent of works'. He first established a factory at Ilafy, 10 km north of Antananarivo before moving to Mantasoa, on the edge of the eastern forest in a region rich in running water but where it was difficult to get the Malagasy to work willingly. At Mantasoa, with official backing, he established an industrial complex employing some 20000 workers. This produced various goods ranging from guns and cannon to glass and soap. Perhaps Laborde's greatest and most lasting creation was the wooden palace of the Queen, later enclosed in stone by Cameron, which now dominates Antananarivo. De Lastelle and Laborde became Malagasy citizens and were incorporated into the ruling oligarchy. 32 Queen Ranavalona continued the expansion which Radama I had begun and consolidated her administration in the conquered territories. The equipment of her army necessitated the prosecution of external trade to obtain ammunition and the encouragement of gun production at Laborde's factory. She levied special taxes for the support of the wars. The town of Fianarantsoa was created in 1831 as a regional capital, and the province of Betsileo was reorganized.

The tragedy of the gifted poet from Madagascar, Jean-Joseph RabØarivelo (??-i937) who committed suicide through his - it was believed - failure to resolve this internal wrench in his colonial psyche, was a dramatic example.

The bulk of the people were engaged in agriculture, primarily for the needs of their families, rice being the main food, especially on the central plateau of the island. The Malagasy had developed the planting of rice to such a high degree of specialization that one observer remarked 'that in few things is the industry and ingenuity of the Malagasy shown more than in the cultivation of rice.'64 Besides agriculture, the economy of Madagascar depended on the rearing of cattle, particularly among the Sakalava in the west and the people in the south of the island. Sheep and pigs reared on the central plateau, and fish, formed major food items among the Malagasy. The Merina were unable to control the trade on the west coast: in the southern part, they were virtually absent, and in the north-western part, they had to compete with the Antalaotra. On the eastern coast, however, they installed and controlled an efficient commercial network.\nThe Malagasy were experts in two main industries, spinning and weaving on the one hand, and mining and metallurgy, especially iron, on the other. They made cloth, and produced a variety of metal articles for their own use. These provided the basis for the technical education received from Europeans.

By 1827, more than 4000 Malagasy could read and write in their own language.$^{18}$ In the field of technical education, the British missionaries also made significant contributions. They sent some young Malagasy either to England or Mauritius for technical education; and at home introduced many technical skills and ideas such as carpentry, building, tannery, the art of modern tin-plating and weaving. The most outstanding missionary who assisted the Malagasy in technical education was James Cameron; he arrived in Antananarivo in 1826 and, except for the few years he spent in exile, remained there until his death in 1875. One of the reasons why the missionaries were so successful was the role played by missionary wives in facilitating contact with Malagasy households, especially the aristocratic ladies, to whom they offered the rudiments of household instruction and provided services such as those of seamstresses. 19 The most important technical assistance that Radama required was a modernized standing army on the British model. He recruited an army of about 15 000 men, equipped with good English guns from the Napoleonic Wars and even some light cannon. They were trained mainly by English instructors, the most important being Hastie and Brady. The resulting army was much better and more effective than those of his adversaries on the island, To sustain professional spirit, Radama I introduced a system of army ranks within the army, based on numbers of'honours', one honour for a private, and up to ten honours for a general.

The Catholics were very active in the Betsileo country and among the subject peoples, who developed a kind of people's Christianity alongside the official religion.

W. Ellis, who delivered them, together with your letter, dated March 26, 1862, to his Majesty within a day or two after their arrival at the capital. The excellency of the materials, and skilful workmanship of all the articles, together with the abundant and appropriate fittings of the canteens, render them, in his Majesty\'s estimation, exceedingly valuable; and, as he observed after inspecting them, such as would greatly diminish the inconveniences of travelling in a country like Madagascar, where the accommodations of more civilised countries cannot be obtained. The expression of kindly interest in Madagascar, and of friendly wishes for its prosperity, from gentlemen engaged like yourselves in large commercial transactions, is peculiarly gratifying to his Majesty, as he expects much benefit to his people from commercial intercourse with English and other nations. His Majesty directs me to inform you that it is his earnest desire to encourage art, science, commerce, education, and, above all, the religion of the Bible, among all classes of his subjects, as the most effectual means of promoting—with the blessing of God—the prosperity of his country. —I have the honour to be, gentlemen, your friend,', 'last_edit_date': '1863-03-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1863#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MADAGASCAR AND ITS PEOPLE', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""A lecture was given, on December 13, on this subject, at the Memorial Hall, Farringdon-street, by Mr. Abraham Kingdon, who has for seven years resided in Madagascar. The chair was taken by Admiral Gore Jones, late special Envoy from Her Majesty to the Queen of that country, Sir H. Verney, M.P., who had been announced to preside, being unable to attend in consequence of having met with an accident a few days ago. The Chairman said he had to state with regret that the Malagasy envoys who had been expected were prevented by the important business of their mission from being present. He spoke highly of the progress which the Hovas had made in civilized arts, and said the governing class in Madagascar were of extraordinary intelligence. The husband of the Queen, who was her Prime Minister, was one of the cleverest men he had ever met. During the ten years of the present Queen's reign that great statesman had abolished the idols, slavery, and trial by poison, and, with the Queen, had publicly embraced Christianity, their example carrying over a great part of the nobles and the people. The religious progress of the people had been so rapid that the work of the missionaries was now chiefly educational. It was a pity that any disturbance should have come to the present state of things—(hear, hear)—for wherever the Hovas went they protected commerce. England had to a great extent brought about the existing condition of Madagascar, and Englishmen were therefore very anxious that the country should not go back. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Kingdon, in the course of his lecture, said the Malagasees had a country full of resources, but, in the face of the threats which had been used to them, they were afraid to open it up.—A vote of thanks was passed to the Chairman, in responding to which he spoke of the second Malagasy envoy as a gentleman possessing a thorough knowledge of English, and as having at home an excellent library of standard English works, every one of which he had read."", 'last_edit_date': '1883-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1883#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.615, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Madagascar', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""The stage or platform was occupied by members of the Royal Family on one side, and foreign guests on the other.

When the Protestant places of worship were opened, there was great astonishment at the number of Christians who presented themselves after their long concealment under most dreadful persecutions.\n\nBy last advices three Roman Catholic priests and four sisters of charity were likewise there; and six priests, with four lay assistants, left Aden in the steamer, on Dec. 12, to reinforce the mission.\n\nThe report made to the Governor of Mauritius by the embassy he sent to the new King of Madagascar is very interesting and important. We will preface a few extracts by one from the instructions given by the Governor to the embassy:—\n\nI may here repeat what I have already amply explained, that there is a clear understanding between the English and the French Governments, that no diplomatic step whatever, that may alter the present relations and state of things with Madagascar, is to be taken by either of these countries, without the full knowledge and consent of the other. With this fact in mind, all approach, or appearance of approach, to that point must be carefully avoided, in act and word, by all members of this mission.\n\nThe following from the report seems to dispose of the falsehoods of the French press about Prime Minister Lambert:—\n\nAlthough there is every disposition on the part of the King and his Government to welcome Europeans, and treat them with respect and kindness, there is yet no truth in the report that the King has sought their official counsel, and has appointed one among the European residents to fill an important executive office. Such a step would be entirely opposed to the spirit of the Madagascar Government.\n\nIn reference to the general joy manifested at the presence of the English, it says:—\n\nWe need not look for an explanation of this feeling. The missionary work, initiated thirty years ago, will sufficiently account for it. Nearly all the arts with which the people are acquainted were taught them by the missionaries, and your excellency will see with astonishment with what patience their workmen carry out any given task, and often with implements ill fitted for the performance of it.

The present Queen accepted these as the condition of her accession. The paragraph which we published last month from the French papers was one calculated to cause some inquietude, except that, as our friends of the London Missionary Society justly observe, ""Every communication since the death of the late King, coming through the French medium, has proved to be either greatly exaggerated or wholly unfounded. That a revolution so recent, so sudden, and involving the assassination of Radama, who had been greatly beloved by large classes of the people, should be followed by temporary disorder and acts of hostility on the part of outlying tribes, was naturally to be expected. Such events, we have every reason to believe, have actually occurred. The Sakalavas, for instance, have always been forward to assert their independence, and at least a part of that tribe appears to have seized the opportunity to make inroads and commit acts of plunder upon the property of the Hovas.""\n\nIn the last letter received from the Rev. Mr. Ellis (the only dependable authority), dated July 2, these acts of hostility are alluded to, and it would seem that the danger had passed away, and that representatives from the different native tribes were then in the capital, professing their allegiance to the Queen.""

The affairs of the kingdom constitute now the business of the Government, in which Christians and Hovas are combined, promptitude and activity are everywhere apparent, and all parties are more careful in their public conduct. This state of things is not unfavourable to the Christians. The hereditary policy of the Hovas is \'Things as they have been;\' \'The wisdom of our ancestors cannot be surpassed.\' But so many innovations have turned out improvements and benefits, that the aim now seems to be to adopt what is good in the new, while retaining what they can of the old.

Besides India, we have sections devoted to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South and West Africa, the West Indies, Burmah, Ceylon, Malta, Cyprus, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, North Borneo, and the Falkland Islands; so that the peoples and the goods of all quarters of the world are brought together at South Kensington. And we are sure that our visitors, on their return home, will greatly interest their stay-at-home friends and neighbours when they attempt to convey to them even a faint idea of the extent and resources of the British Empire.\n\nIn our last number we were enabled to lay before our readers a list of the gentlemen who have been associated together in carrying out the arrangements for the proper representation of the West African Settlements; and in the section devoted to this subject will be found many objects of interest serving to illustrate the natural productions of this portion of the world and the mechanical skill of the people.

There is one superb necklet of gold and precious stones which is deserving of special mention. Many of these ornaments form part of the tribute paid by the King of Ashanti after the war of twelve years ago. Besides these valuables, the Gold Coast exhibits some fine specimens of native cloth, woven and dyed, besides stuffed specimens of brightly painted birds and butterflies, and a large collection of miscellaneous articles of native production.

His name at the head of the Exhibition will prove attractive, and the exhibits of himself and his officers, will certainly be interesting.\n\nThe entrance to this Exhibition is through a palisade formed of tree stems, the door lifting up inwards, and so arranged that those inside may see whether the approaching stranger is a friend or foe. Inside one enters the camp of an explorer: the tent, the table, camp stools, cooking utensils, observing instruments, bales of goods, and the other baggage with which an African explorer must encumber himself. The camp is pitched in the midst of some extraordinary scenery. On one side it looks out upon the houses of Bagamoyo and the sea beyond; on the other side there is the Congo rushing over Stanley Falls, while round the corner is the Aruwimi forest, with Mount Ruwenzori in the far distance. Passing through the encampment, one finds himself face to face with a bust of the Queen, opposite which is a full-length portrait of the King of the Belgians. Near these are two excellent portraits of Mr. Stanley, with a variety of articles, against a background of tastefully arranged and appropriate drapery. Madagascar grass mats drape the pillars, while here and there will be seen some wonderful grass fabrics, soft as velvet, with patterns of ingenuity. These are from the Kasai river, the very heart of the Congo and are of purely native manufacture. Some 200 years ago, when the Dutch frequented the West Coast, they found a people who wrought grass into similar textures; but these people have been driven into the interior, and are now found in the region of the Kasai tributary of the Congo.\n\nWhen the visitor passes through the encampment he finds himself in the heart of Africa. At first one feels bewildered amid the display of spears and daggers, axes, bows and arrows, shields, implements and utensils of brass and iron, fetishes, drums, tom-toms, stringed and other musical instruments, ornaments of gold, copper, brass, and others too numerous to mention; but he must be sure to study the historical series of maps which shows the progress of our knowledge of Africa, from the earliest period down to the present day.\n\nTwo of the maps are of special interest at the present time. One is a Portuguese map of the seventeenth century, in which the ""Empire of Monomotapa"" is represented as extending across the continent.

Mr. Ellis, who writes on the 16th May, says:—\n\n""The King was addicted to many superstitious notions about dreams and spiritual agencies, habitually enforcing any argument with the expression that he believed it, for it was right, because \'God told him so.\' Any account of supernatural appearances or phenomena had a peculiar charm for him, much more so than any direct reasoning upon cause and effect.""\n\nThe persons interested in the continuance of heathen customs took advantage of this.

The subjects of this disease pretended to be unconscious of their actions; to be unable to refrain from leaping, running, dancing, &c. They also saw visions and heard voices from the invisible world. One of these visions, seen by many, was the ancestors of the King, and the voices they heard announced the coming of these ancestors to tell the King what he was to do for the good of the country. Subsequently a message was brought to him as from his ancestors, to the effect that, if he did not stop \'the praying,\' some great calamity would soon befall him. To the surprise of his best friends, the King was exceedingly interested in this strange movement, seemed to believe the pretended message from the world of spirits, and encouraged the frantic dancers, who daily thronged his house, and declared that the disease would continue to increase till \'the praying\' was stopped. It is generally reported that these movements were prompted by the guardians of the idols, and promoted by his own Mena maso,* who bribed parties to come as sick persons in large numbers from the country, in order to continue the delusion.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1863#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""MADAGASCAR'S QUEEN"", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A Reuter despatch from Antananarivo says: The coronation of the new Queen of Madagascar took place on Nov. 22.

Most of the caterpillars of the country cover themselves with silky envelopes, which protect them both from the inclemency of winter and the sudden showers of the summer season. Some are naturally covered from their birth with a thick mantle which grows with them, leaving only the head and legs uncovered. Others spin double and treble cocoons, and others again mix up various particles of plants with their silk, combining them artistically; and, lastly, there are some which spin a common nest, in which they live under a republican form of government, each individual spinning its own cocoon besides. The last number of the Bulletin de la Societe d'Acclimatation contains a curious paper on this subject by M. Auguste Vinson, of La Réunion. He states that the Hovas weave a kind of silk which they call landy; and is obtained from the worm that feeds on the leaves of the ambrevade, or Angola pea (Cytisus cajanus). This silk is heavy, and has no gloss, but is exceedingly strong. The natives sell the tissues they weave out of this silk very dear, and it is therefore only the rich who wear them. King Radama II., who dresses in the European fashion, wears trousers and a paletôt made of this silk, which, not being dyed, is of a grey colour, like unbleached linen. The wealthy are buried in shrouds made of this silk, and it is said that such shrouds entombed for centuries have been exhumed in a perfect state of preservation. The ambrevade being an indigenous plant of La Réunion,* this Madagascar silkworm might be easily introduced there. The insect is 45 millimetres long; its body is composed of 12 segments, and covered with black sharp horny points all over.

THE COMMERCIAL OUTLOOK.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Commercially and industrially speaking, the coast of Madagascar may be divided into five great divisions. The first is the long stretch of east coast from Antongil Bay to Fort Dauphin, forming almost a straight line. It contains not a single really good natural harbour, nor a decently navigable river of any length, and most of its towns are only approached by dangerous roadsteads. From its geographical position it will easily be understood that its foreign element are mostly Mauritians. The natural resources of this coast have been to a great extent exhausted, and the prospects now lie principally in sugar-planting. The Mauritians are naturally acquainted with this industry, and there is a great future before them. Coffee is also a profitable undertaking, but it must not be planted at a lower elevation than 1,500 feet above the level of the sea. Spices of almost every kind can also be cultivated auxiliary to the sugar plantations. The second division is that called the North-east Coast, being that part between Antongil Bay and Cape Amber. It contains two or three harbours, but not very good ones. The forests here are much larger than in any other part, and consequently the natural supplies of India-rubber and gum-copal are still plentiful. This is the most thinly populated part of the island, but exceedingly fertile. Probably in a few more years the natural resources will be exhausted, and foreign residents will then have recourse to agriculture, with better results perhaps than can be obtained on any other part of the East Coast. The third division of the Coast is the North-west, from Cape Amber to Cape St. Andrew, and the part coveted by France. This part contains lignite deposits and valuable woods, and is full of good harbours. Its foreign element consists chiefly of Indians and Muslims, and a few French Creoles. The fourth division is the West Coast, properly called—i.e., from Cape St. Andrew North to St. Augustine South. Full of good harbours and navigable rivers, it is probably the finest part of Madagascar. The foreigners there are mostly Americans and Englishmen, who carry on a trade with the Cape and Natal. The fifth part is the Southern portion, from St. Augustine to Fort Dauphin, about which nothing is really known.\n\nIt will be seen, then, how little is yet known of the vast commercial resources of this island, and of the number of industries that may be opened. The trade of the last few months has been characterised by a little more activity, but at best can only be said to be very slack. The coast merchants are still prevented from exporting such articles as would afford supplies to the French armies, or were prevented up to a very short time ago.

Such changes as were introduced in the cultural field, such racial discrimination as was practised, and such condemnation of African culture as was preached even in the heyday of colonialism, were all confined primarily to the coastal areas and the urban centres, and never penetrated into the rural areas where life ran gaily on very much as before. African dance, art, music and traditional religious systems held their own and such borrowings and adaptations as were made by Africans were not only selective but also, to borrow M. J. Herskovits' terminology, 'additive' and not necessarily 'substitutive'. 56 Thus, in the rural areas and even to some extent in the urban ones, new beliefs, new gods, new utensils, new artefacts and new objects were added to the old ones. Certainly, in these areas, many Christians did and still do retain their belief in their traditional gods. Indeed, in the field of religion, if anything, it was the European religion that was rather Africanized as is obvious from the rituals, hymns, music and even doctrines of some of the syncretic and millenarian churches and not the other way round. What is even more important, the ground that was lost even in the urban centres in the field of culture has virtually been regained. Today, African art, music and dance are not only taught in educational institutions of all kinds but are now in boom in Africa and gaining recognition in Europe.

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure.

Some of the twenty-four songs he had collected in this way he sang at concerts where they were crudely described as \'kaffir songs\'. 5\nThe \'kaffir songs\' which Mr Swift rendered to elegant European gather› ings in the salons of Durban were of course contemporaneously rendered in environments of the most profoundly contrasting physical, spiritual, economic and social significance. For the Kuyu people (Central Africa), similar songs would be an invocation of the life-force of the community, such as the rituals of planting and harvesting, death and fertility. (It may of course be safely assumed that few Europeans ever succeeded in collecting the truly sacred songs of such peoples.) But the role and social function of music is what is of fundamental interest here, for it is through music, more than any form of art, that the lived cultural reality of the peoples is most readily grasped.$^{6}$ When the Kuyu, for example, performed their dusk-to-dawn sequence of song, dance and symbolic mime in the funeral ceremonies for a famed woman farmer, who was regarded as being exceptionally proficient in the cultivation of manioc (cassava), we are brought into a process of affirmation of life continuity, and even the practical evocation of economic survival for the living. The mime and lyric are consciously directed to transmitting her magical touch with plants to the living; an explosion of voice and motion simultaneously induced a catharsis for the entire community, purged them of their grief and strengthened them for the continuing struggle for survival.

The West African coast truly dramatizes the situation, shifting forms and local› ization under the double assault of Islamic structures and Christian evangelizing, the latter being in turn supported by the influence of returnee slaves in Sierra Leone and Liberia, who brought with them the entertain› ment forms of their countries of exile, their manners, values, costumes, and idioms. 11 Throughout the nineteenth century, theatrical professionalism was a way of life in the old Oyo empire in Nigeria, representing the evolution of secular theatre from masked representation during the funeral rites of a king.

Part of the consequences of the violent movements of the Shona peoples between the Cape and Central Africa is that it is now difficult to say how much of their musical instrumentation - and indeed the social functions of their music - were carried into or came from the neighbouring countries of Mozambique, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), Tanganyika (now Tanzania), the Congos (now Zaire and Congo), and Uganda where the practice was widespread, into Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) where the majority of the Shona gradually became concentrated at the turn of the century. (See Fig. 8.1.) What is beyond dispute, however, is that the mbira culture became a unifying bond among the scattered peoples and survived their constant and intensive fragmentation.\nMbira music was considered by the Shona a gift of their great common ancestral spirit Chaminuka who appears to have been a living person, a king in the early part of the nineteenth century. The music entered wholly into social life, penetrating it so thoroughly that it became indispensable to the various activities of healing, weddings, funerals, field labour, birth, initiations and a host of other social undertakings. The mbira instrument itself was held 'capable of projecting its sound to heaven and linking up with the world of spirits' and therefore, in effect, linked the activities and the thoughts of the living with the presence of their ancestors.\nThe performers were both settled and itinerant; they did not always wait upon invitations, although notable mbira players have been hired from distances of hundreds of miles either for their sheer artistic reputation, or because their style of playing was considered best suited to a desired end - usually the successful possession of a medium. It can be observed that a culturally cohesive community was maintained in this way, across geographical boundaries. The night-long bira ceremonies which moved early into the possession of the medium, thereafter into the purely social pleasures of dancing, singing, poetic (including comic) recitals and mimicry, have been aptly described as 'a long, communal journey through the night'.

One of the best-known movements which used both religion and magic to resist colonial rule and oppression was the Majï Majï movement in German East Africa during the first decade of the twen› tieth century.$^{8}$ (See Fig. 7.1.) Even though the movement failed, it served as a demonstration of the fact that unity could be achieved in African traditional religion in the face of European pressure and that African traditional religion was not a fragmentary force confined to limited localities. Besides, the movement provided the seed for African nationalism which was later to germinate and blossom into the struggle for independ› ence and its final achievement in the 1960s.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The imposition of European colonial rule on Africa was not merely the forceful establishment of European political, economic and social power on colonial possessions.

A gunboat, with Mr. Consul Hewett on board, proceeded there lately, the object being the coercion of Ja Ja, principally because Ja Ja is becoming too civilized for the European traders in his river. The Opobo, which is supposed to be one of the many outlets of the great Niger, is a deep wide river, but it has a nasty bar at its mouth, which at times breaks heavily, and is, consequently, exceedingly dangerous.

Two native processions, headed by their bands, appeared on the scene; one of these was the Accra Rising Reserve Corps, the other the Band of Hope Lodge. Accra was nearly hidden in smoke, and it was feared the natives would expend their ammunition before the event of the day came off—a fear that was afterwards quickly dispelled.\n\nThe first company to arrive was that from the village of Teche, distant about fifteen miles, who, with their King at their head, banners streaming, war drums beating, and rifles waving, advanced at the double from eastward, and took up their position opposite Government House. They were accompanied by a number of women, who, with calabashes on their heads, filled with water, and branches of trees in their hands, sprinkled the refreshing liquid about, and urged on the men with shouts, yells, and laughter.

An editor informed me that a friend of his who visited the Centennial advised him that he saw the gold trinkets from the Gold Coast, but he was told that those trinkets were made by the white settlers on the Gold Coast. I beg to deny this assertion _in toto_. In the first place, there are no white settlers on the West Coast of Africa, beginning from ""St. Mary\'s Bathurst, Gambia,"" to ""St. Paul de Loanda."" The few Europeans and Americans on that Coast are either Government officials, missionaries, or merchants. The large assortment of gold trinkets that are in the main building at the Centennial are as follows: Gold ear-rings, gold drops, gold bracelets, of various designs; gold hair-combs, gold crosses, gold brooches, in shapes of butterflies and other designs; gold rings, with the twelve signs of the Zodiac and numerous other designs; gold beads, gold studs, gold links, gold chains, gold necklaces, gold guards, gold dust, and other gold trinkets too numerous to mention; and these gold trinkets were made by the native Africans, some of whom cannot speak a word of the English language. In style of workmanship these trinkets are unequalled by anything made by civilized craftsmen the world over. Certainly there is nothing in this line in the Centennial that may be placed beside them; and when it is considered that they were wrought with rude tools, that the artizans were native men, unskilled in civilized art; that they and their fathers from time immemorial have ever lived on the Gold Coast, that they are the manufacturers of the largest assortment of trinkets in the Centennial,—then it seems to me that these men,—the ""Ashantees,"" the ""Accras,"" the ""Fantees,"" the ""Denkras,"" the ""Wassaws,"" the ""Assins,"" &c.,—should not be deprived of the meed of praise which belongs to them, but should receive the just reward for their great genius and their native art. I therefore, as an African, of which I am proud, having been born, bred and educated on that Coast, feel called upon to make this explanation. On several occasions while visiting the Centennial, I spent some time in explaining to the ladies and gentlemen who crowded around me that these trinkets were made by the native Africans, and I took great pains to impress upon their minds the capability and ingenuity of the native Africans. I would like very much that the words West Africa should be placed under the words Gold Coast, for many persons will think that the Gold Coast is in Australia or California, and thus deprive Africa of her just merits. Give to all nations, tribes, and people what is due to them.

In the Lagos section are arranged many of the curious articles brought by Mr. Joseph Thomson from the Niger in his recent journey up that river. The brass-work especially deserves attention; solid brass anklets, formidable stirrups, armlets, brass figures of various kinds; the Koran printed on silk from Nupé; and a curious cowrie box. The specimen of ample robes from the Niger ought to encourage Manchester manufactures, while the numerous photographs exhibited by Mr. Thomson are highly instructive. The plan of Lagos looks well on paper. The Shea butter from the Niger seems to be growing in importance as an export. In the cloths from the Gambia European influence is markedly evident in the patterns. The tea exhibited does not look particularly inviting; even if the climate were suited for its culture, we doubt if there is enterprise enough in the colony to devote to it the care necessary for its preparation for market. Specimens of Gambia rubber are plentiful, while Captain Moloney's natural history collection does him great credit.

We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.608, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Progress on the West African Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The African rivers situate in the Bight of Benin, commonly known as the Oil Rivers, have been placed under the protectorate of Great Britain. The protectorate, announced at Bonny, in December last, by Admiral Sir Walter Hunt Grubb, extends from the right bank of Benin river to the Rio del Rey, thus including Brass, New and Old Calabar, Bonny, Opobo, and other important trading stations.\n\nTwo series of considerations, the internal and external, have combined to render action imperative, and a retrospective view may not be uninstructive. Since the abolition of the export of slaves, these localities have been the sites of trading stations, palm oil being the chief article of export. The traders have been, with few exceptions, British, and the capitalists mostly Liverpool merchants. The natives allowed trading hulks to be anchored and commerce conducted on payment of fixed sums, known as ""comey."" Bonny, Brass, and Old Calabar are among the oldest of these trading ports, the native chiefs being also the native traders. They possessed numerous slaves who were sent with merchandise to the interior markets to collect oil, which was brought to the stations and sold to the whites. Among the Bonny chiefs was the father of Ja Ja, late King of Opobo; his son was brought up to the management of the business, and on his father\'s death he succeeded to his position. Of his enemies the most powerful was Oko Jumbo, who lost no opportunity to humiliate him. The Europeans could only let matters take their course; they regretted constant fighting of Oko Jumbo and Ja Ja, but the relations between the Europeans and natives being strictly commercial, nothing could be done.

It is about 102 years old, thus considerably younger than the Gambia, which almost ranks with Newfoundland as being one of the very first British possessions abroad. Sierra Leone, however, has not much to show for its century of British rule. Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary. Here at present the great Mahommedan Chief Samadu is the actual ruler, and has created one of those African empires which are easily reared by successful robbers with extravagant bloodshed and widespread depredation. Samadu has several times fought the French on the Senegambian frontier, but of late he is said to have concluded peace with them. The productions of Sierra Leone are those of true Western Africa, and the colony is rich and well-favoured in vegetable wealth. It exports palm oil, palm kernels, rubber, gum, camwood, besides skins and benniseed and ground nuts.\n\nLiberia is British in language, and to a great extent in such culture as it possesses, although it enjoys an independent Government. But its native inhabitants, the Kru-boys, are under the delusion that they are British subjects ""of a sort,"" and do not admit any political connexion with the Americanised negroes who claim to govern them. On the east of Liberia, between the frontier and the west boundary of the French Gold Coast, is the Ivory Coast, about 100 miles in extent, and one of the last portions of the African coast, which remains unclaimed, unprotected, and unannexed by any European Power.

The walls of their dwellings are rarely, if ever, whitewashed, and are often crowded, ill-ventilated, and dirty. Most of the rooms are miserably small, dark, damp, and badly ventilated, especially those devoted to sleep. In their sleeping places the poorer classes, and many persons in better circumstances, keep all the dirty clothing not in wear either about their beds or hanging from the wall, scraps of food and putrid fish being strewed about or collected in corners. The lower rooms open into inner courts, where, in fine weather, the members of the several families meet, and where they often cook and eat their food. The houses of what may be termed the middling class are well furnished with European articles of cabinet furniture, with crockery, glass, and mirrors, while the walls are decorated with cheap prints. The wealthy native gentlemen (living in the seaboard towns) live in well-built houses, commodiously, and often elegantly, furnished; but few of them have fireplaces in the public rooms or bedrooms—a want which impairs health in a country exposed to heavy night-dews, and in some wet seasons to heavy falls of rain. The general custom on the Gold Coast is to burn charcoal in clay pots in the public rooms and bedrooms when the weather is damp or cold.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

According to Logan, the pre-Aryan civilisation of Southern India had a partially Egyptian character. The oldest races, he asserts, were of a variable African type which spoke languages allied to the African. Egypt, and not India, is the common cradle of all we have in common, east, west, north, and south, all round the world. The languages, beliefs, rites, laws and customs went out to India, but did not return thence by means of the apocryphal Aryan migrations.

In former times sufficient attention was not always given by the authorities to the suitability of candidates for employment in the minor posts in these then much despised West African possessions. But all this has greatly changed. The growing importance of the West African trade, and the general éclaircissement which followed the operations of the Ashanti War, have brought about a different spirit in the administration of these colonies, and the present colonial service in West Africa is not inferior to any other branch of the service in other parts of the world, and of late has furnished a considerable proportion of remarkable men who have distinguished themselves on the West Coast of Africa, and have been raised to posts of great influence and distinction elsewhere. I think, however, that decidedly more might be done to encourage such work as I have referred to in Lagos, namely, a thorough and scientific examination of the natural history and ethnology of these lands, so that we can be better guided in our administration of them, both by increasing our knowledge of their natural resources and by becoming more acquainted with the character of the races whom we are to rule. Especially should the learning of native languages be fostered among colonial officers. This movement has been already begun on the Gold Coast by Sir Brandford Griffith, and in Lagos by Captain Moloney, but I do not think any official steps have been taken in the matter. In nearly all the great divisions of Africa there is some lingua Franca—some widespread language of general use among native traders, or the ruling caste, which would be understood everywhere, from Benin to Old Calabar, and up the Niger to its confluence with the Benue; the Yoruba tongue, which is prevalent throughout Logos colony and right away to the kingdom of Nupe; the Hausa language, which is a good deal spoken in the Gold Coast colony, and which is one of the leading tongues of the Niger basin; the Mandingo, which is widely spread as a commercial language over the Sierra Leone colony; and the Wolof, which is much spoken on the Gambia. In the learning of each one of these languages in their respective spheres of influence colonial officers should be encouraged by small bounties or some palpable reward. These languages are simple in construction, and are illustrated by grammars and dictionaries published by the various missionary societies.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.614, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In all the coast region between the Gambia and the Cameroons the most extravagant development of tropical vegetation is seen. The great future wealth of the interior plateaux will certainly lie in their mineral deposits, the riches of the West Coast region lie in its numerous and valuable vegetable products, of which the most striking are palm oil, and ground nuts, benniseed, shea butter, rubber, gums, spices, cotton, dyes, and valuable timbers, among which ebony occupies a prominent place. With regard to animal products, I might mention ivory and monkey skins. Whereas some of the great races of the interior speak languages which connect them with the Hamitic and Semitic families. The native inhabitants of the West Coast are all that there is of most typically Negro in character; yet I do not mean they are races of particularly low development; on the contrary, the typical Negro is a fine specimen of man, and is by no means as low in his mental state as the races of Polynesia and America. I may cite the Kru tribes of that portion of West Africa which is known as Liberia, a country inhabited by an industrious, energetic, hardworking, stalwart population of free men. An element of heterogeneous ex-slave settlers among the tribes of the coast may be found in some parts of the Colonies of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos. These people represent the Nemesis which invariably follows national crimes. We and our American children indulged to a greater extent than any other European nation in the African slave trade, and, as our wrong-doing was violent and exaggerated, so to a certain extent was the abrupt reparation which followed. Although I would not minimise the work done by our blockade on the West Coast, the abolition of the slave trade was more effectually brought about by the abolition of slavery in the United States of America. One result of our suppression of the slave trade in West Africa has not been altogether advantageous. I refer to the Slave Colonies established at Sierra Leone, and at Fernando Po and other points on the coast. It may be taken that the slaves exported from any district are the least worthy people in it, and the result is that a large proportion of this population is descended from the sweepings of West Africa, and has not yet passed through sufficient generations to eliminate the ancestral badness of its progenitors. So, although here and there a negro has shown what the race can attain to under favourable circumstances, still the bulk of the ""S\'a Leone"" people who are scattered up and down the coast are of an undesirable character, and the cause of indiscriminating blame on the part of superficial observers which is most unjustly laid on the shoulders of the entire population of West Africa; whereas many of these races are superior in intelligence, enterprise, and integrity to any of our negro fellow-subjects in South Africa or the West Indies. What admirable recruits to civilised society can be obtained from many of these people may be instanced by such men as Bishop Crowther, Archdeacons Johnson and Crowther, Samuel Lewis, and other divines and lawyers and officials in West Africa, who are on a par with well-educated white men, and in some cases superior in intelligence and acquirements to the whites with whom they come in contact. It is absurd, however, to regard the Negro race, as a whole, on the same average level as the European—they are far below us. Take them in their native wilds, and they are what we were before Julius Caesar landed in this country; indeed, in many cases they are not 2,000 years behind us, but 10,000. They are in the condition of some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and Gaul, and Spain, whose history we can dimly spell out from their implements and scattered remains, who were undoubtedly cannibals and probably naked, and leading a brutish life. Yet we can in a few years drag them from the condition that prevailed 2,000 years before Christ into the year of grace 1889. We can take a cannibal from the Upper Cross River, and transport him to the centres of civilisation in England or America, where everything represents the utmost result of our present development; but what will be usually the result both with the individual and the race? The savage mind will be unable to grasp and assimilate one-third of the wonders presented to his consideration, and will probably even suffer from the shock. We cannot expect the negroes of West Africa to become all at once intelligent, self-governing people. For many years the white races must be their guardians and educators, and we must educate the negro by force if necessary, leaving him to understand us afterwards, when we have raised him to a condition to do so. This, then, is our mission in West Africa: to instruct the natives that idleness is the eighth deadly sin; next, to so instruct the native as to the existence of the resources of this country; and, lastly, to educate him in the principles of civilised society, and so assimilate his views with our own that he and we may be bound together with the ties of commerce and Empire.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}]",True

In Bunafu, not only was there a sense of government and authority, some of the migrants came with traditions of structured hierarchical political systems from which they were fleeing, but which they still drew upon in the rivalries that accompanied the emergence of a new authority system in Bunafu.

Ekpe may be considered to have been an asset in the political system of Calabar in that it united all the free men of wealth and influence in a common organization. But its discrimination against the large body of men of slave origin and the poor led to the social disturbances of the mid-nineteenth century, which Dike has referred to as slave revolts.\nThe association of plantation slaves known as the Bloodmen came into being specifically as a pressure group to prevent the sacrifice of slaves at the deaths of kings and lineage heads.

However, the association did not become a revolt for the emancipation of slaves, or even for the seizure of political power from the Ekpe.

If successful, he thus acquired title to an office which he used to integrate himself into a political system.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways.

Now, from what I have seen on the West Coast I am perfectly certain that on the Tanganyika, and in the Rubeho Mountains, beside; in Katanga, whence I saw gold brought, the precious metal may be found.'}, {'id': 5908, 'article_title': ""Central Africa and Mr. Stanley's Expedition"", 'full_section_title': ""Central Africa and Mr. Stanley's Expedition"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1889#article-8', 'issue_date': '01_10_1889', 'content': '\n\nMr. Ward, in the course of his lecture, explained that he first went Africa in 1884, when he entered the service of the King of the Belgians. The first year and a-half he spent in travelling among the tribes of the Lower Congo. He applied himself to learning their language and to obtaining information about their customs and superstitions. They proved to be most ignorant and most superstitious. They lived in small villages scattered about the country, and in no single instance was a ruler to be found with more than a few hundred subjects. The greatest obstacle to progress and enlightenment in this portion of Africa was the charm doctor. After spending some months in becoming acquainted with the language and manners of the people, he was, in 1886, transferred to the command of the station at Bangala. It was here that Stanley had his severe fight on his great journey across the continent, and it was in March 1887, when proceeding down country from Bangala, that he met Stanley. He had broken camp one morning early and was marching along when in the distance, coming over the brow of a hill, he saw a tall Soudanese warrior bearing Mr. Gordon Bennett\'s yacht flag. Behind the soldier, and astride a magnificent mule, came the great explorer. Following immediately in his rear were his personal servants, Somalis with their braided waistcoats and white robes. Then came Zanzibaris with their blankets, water-bottles, ammunition coats, their rifles on their backs, and innumerable straps and leather belts around their bodies; Wagawali porters bearing boxes of ammunition, to which were fastened axes, shovels, and hose lines, as well as their little bundles of clothing, which were invariably rolled up in old threadbare blankets. Stanley, whose name in Africa is Bula Matidi—the stone breaker—saluted him cordially and dismounted. ""Take a seat,"" said he, pointing to the bare ground. They squatted down, and Stanley producing a silver cigar case, given him, he said, by the Prince of Wales the night before he left England, they both smoked the cigar of peace. He had already rendered Stanley a service by obtaining some 500 carriers to transport his baggage, and he now offered himself as a volunteer in the expedition. Stanley made little difficulty, and set him at once to work, arranging a meeting at Stanley Pool later. Passing along the procession, he became further acquainted with the constitution of Stanley\'s cavalcade. At one point the whale boat was being carried in sections, suspended from poles, which were each borne by four men. Donkeys laden with sacks of rice were next met with, and a little further back were the women of Tippoo Tib\'s harem, their faces concealed and their bodies draped in gaudily coloured clothes. Here and there was an English officer. A flock of goats next came along, and then the form of Tippoo Tib came into view as he strutted majestically along in his flowing Arab robes and large turban, carrying over his right shoulder a jewelled hilted sword, the emblem of office from the Sultan of Zanzibar. Behind him followed several Arab sheikhs, whose bearing was quiet and dignified.'}, {'id': 6727, 'article_title': 'Liverpool and West Africa', 'full_section_title': 'Liverpool and West Africa', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1896#article-12', 'issue_date': '02_03_1896', 'content': '\n\n""Dear Sir,—I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th inst. respecting the King of Benin. My experience of him and his people since 1858 has always been of the same nature—a desire to be in touch with the white trader, but also a determination to keep him away, as far as residency goes, from his own capital. On my arrival in Benin River in 1858 to relieve Mr. Snape, agent for Messrs. Charles Horsfall & Sons, of Liverpool, I found he had just returned from a visit to the King. The account of his reception then coincided exactly with the formalities still observed, and the vestiges of human sacrifices were perhaps even more visible than at present—crucified bodies mutilated (as usual amongst all the African tribes associated with the palm oil trade), living and dead young females fastened up in high trees to propitiate the gods for rain. Photographs of such scenes were published a few years ago in The Daily Graphic, taken on the spot. Human skulls and bones lined the main street of the city, all acknowledged to be the result of sacrifice. The observances in regard to an interview with the King were the same as described in a small book herewith, descriptive of an agent\'s, of Messrs. Stuart & Douglas, journey thereto (Mr. H. C. Clarke). The King was very pleased to accept the presents given to him, and made all sorts of promises in regard to opening up trade, but always with one understanding. All trade must be done at Gwato, and no one to be allowed to approach the city without due notice being given. In 1859-60, Mr. R. C. Henry, a Liverpool merchant, formerly agent for Messrs. Thomas Harrison & Co., tried to establish a factory at Gwato, but after the first month or so what little trade there had been fell off, presumably because presents were not continually being sent to the King. At last Mr. Henry\'s agent (Mr. H. C. Clarke) was withdrawn. In 1889 the next attempt was made by a Mr. Punch, who made frequent journeys to the city, establishing business at Gwato. Trade went on briskly for a short time, so much so as to induce Messrs. Miller Bros. & Co., of Glasgow, to erect a factory at Gwato also, and a moderate amount of trade was continued, but at last fell off as before. In all the cases traders were told that the King and his people interfered, not wishing any trade to be done direct with the white traders; all must go through his own or his \'traders\' hands, thereby making profitable trade impossible. There is a certain tree grows there called \'the king\'s tree.\' By placing a branch or slip of this tree across any path, it is death for any Native to use that path. So the Natives are prevented from coming direct to the factories, consequently they cannot trade but through the King and his people. Many Europeans, H.M. representatives, consuls, vice-consuls, and traders, &c., have been visitors to the King in very recent years, all bringing accounts of the visible signs of sacrifices and cruelties still practised. Stronger means were intended to be resorted to for opening up this country when I left Old Calabar in 1895, for it is evident that it cannot be done without force or the practice of human sacrifice abolished.—Yours, &c., (Signed) T. S. Forshaw.""'}]","[{'document_title': 'OLD CALABAR.—ELECTION OF A NEW KING. CEREMONY AND FESTIVITIES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'rose and went through a somewhat similar performance. Prince Duke then joined the chiefs, and they all advanced to the seat occupied by Consul Hopkins, who, with his wife and several Europeans, was present as the representative of the Queen. The ""music"" ceased, and perfect quietness reigned while the chiefs presented the Prince to Mr. Hopkins as the future King of Old Calabar. This was the signal for a demonstration of the most extraordinary character. The whole company rose _en masse_, shouted, screamed, jumped and yelled as only Africans can, and then the dancing began afresh and became general. The King-elect was attired in a robe of bright-coloured cloth, an admiral\'s worn-out hat, with a white feather sticking in it, covering his head. He carried a silver spear, and a live fowl, tied by the leg to a long string which his majesty held, fluttered on the ground before him. A brush of peacock\'s feathers, some five or six feet long, was suspended from his back to represent a tail. Some of the native costumes were ludicrous in the extreme. Discarded naval and military uniforms were the favourites, on account of their bright colours. Big negroes wore little coats, the sleeves of which did not reach further than their elbows, and they were tied with string in front to draw them close to the body; others again, of small stature, wore large coats, and the result was often that, when the collars were turned up, very little of the wearer\'s inside could be seen. During the progress of the dancing a good deal of commotion and some terror was caused amongst the natives by the sudden appearance of one of the members of a secret society known as ""Egbo men."" This is a society to which at present only two white men are known to belong, all the rest being natives. Its members are selected with very great care, and the main object of the organization is understood to be to obtain justice in their dealings with others. If a member has a transaction with a native, and the latter fails in any momentary obligation he may have incurred, the matter is mentioned before the heads of the society, and the offender is seized and imprisoned until the amount is paid. About eleven o\'clock every night a horn is blown, which sounds all over the town, and on hearing this an ""Egbo man,"" with a bell tied to him, and with a number of followers attending him, starts to scour the whole place, and if anybody, be it man, woman, or child, is found abroad at that hour, they receive prompt punishment, and very often most serious personal injury is thus inflicted. As with secret societies in England, the Egbo men have their strict rules and regulations; the meetings are conducted with closed doors, and each member is sworn not to divulge anything of the proceedings. When the Egbo man referred to appeared at the dance, the upper portion of his body was encased in armour, and his legs were covered with elaborate bead-work; he wore a mask to conceal his features, and had a bunch of feathers behind him as a tail, to which was attached his bell, the sound of which, when he makes his nightly journeys, is so terrifying to the inhabitants. After his disappearance from the scene, the natives resumed their dancing, which was kept up till nightfall, when they all retired to another enclosed space, where the ceremony of burning an effigy of Satan brought the day\'s rejoicings to an end.', 'last_edit_date': '1879-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1879#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.604, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'A Royal Monument in Dahomey', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Whydah, Dahomey, June 30, 1868.\n\nSir,—I went up to Abomey in January last, to witness the erection of a monument which the king was going to make for his father. It was thus: He built three round houses in one of the palace-yards, named Commasie. They were each ten feet in diameter; one was for his deceased father, one for the supposed deceased friend of his father, and one for the late king's mother, who died before him. The following tools and materials were given by the king for making the monument: 2 gold pickaxes, 2 silver ditto; 2 gold hoes, and 2 silver ditto; 2 gold trowels, and 2 silver ditto; 2 copper hoes, 2 brass ditto, and 2 iron ditto; 2 iron pickaxes, 2 copper ditto, and 2 brass ditto; 1 gold-gilt watering-pot, and 1 silver-gilt ditto; 24 puncheons of rum; some gold and silver coins; some coral and other kinds of beads; some pieces of silk damask (these were torn into small pieces); and the blood of forty human beings caught by the king in his wars. All these implements were equally divided between the two prime ministers, Mingah and Maywoo, for mixing the swish, and during the mixing he threw into the mixture two boxes of gold-dust, the coral and other beads, the silk pieces also, and the blood of the human beings. This work occupied about a week. The coverings were silk, bamboo mats, and grass; and three ornaments—one like a vessel, one like an eagle, and one like a large umbrella tree—were put on the top of the three circular houses which we call monuments. At the front eight posts and cross-sticks were erected, and skulls and coral and other beads were hung on them. Smaller posts, similarly ornamented, were at the sides. On the day of the dedication almost everyone in the kingdom made presents to the king—gold coins, cowries, cloths, bullocks, sheep, goats, ducks, fowls, pigeons, palm-oil, &c. This also occupied about a week, and at the close of the presents the king produced six ornaments, some made in Europe and the others in Dahomey, in the form of hand lanterns, which were then shown to the assembly, the king saying that he had made them for his good father, who left him a large property to enjoy his kingship with. Three weeks after this he went on a war expedition, to some place of which we, the residents, are ignorant. He returned home unsuccessful, and of course, not being content at having come back empty-handed, made another expedition to five small places, which he broke, and caught all the people and brought them to Abomey. Now, lately, on the 20th inst., he made the gun custom, which ended yesterday. On this occasion all the captains swore in the large market that they would go to Abeokuta in four months' time and fight against the people there, and break the place, and catch every soul, and show them that the king has braver warriors yet than those whom the Abeokutans defeated in the last war.

An editor informed me that a friend of his who visited the Centennial advised him that he saw the gold trinkets from the Gold Coast, but he was told that those trinkets were made by the white settlers on the Gold Coast. I beg to deny this assertion _in toto_. In the first place, there are no white settlers on the West Coast of Africa, beginning from ""St. Mary\'s Bathurst, Gambia,"" to ""St. Paul de Loanda."" The few Europeans and Americans on that Coast are either Government officials, missionaries, or merchants. The large assortment of gold trinkets that are in the main building at the Centennial are as follows: Gold ear-rings, gold drops, gold bracelets, of various designs; gold hair-combs, gold crosses, gold brooches, in shapes of butterflies and other designs; gold rings, with the twelve signs of the Zodiac and numerous other designs; gold beads, gold studs, gold links, gold chains, gold necklaces, gold guards, gold dust, and other gold trinkets too numerous to mention; and these gold trinkets were made by the native Africans, some of whom cannot speak a word of the English language. In style of workmanship these trinkets are unequalled by anything made by civilized craftsmen the world over. Certainly there is nothing in this line in the Centennial that may be placed beside them; and when it is considered that they were wrought with rude tools, that the artizans were native men, unskilled in civilized art; that they and their fathers from time immemorial have ever lived on the Gold Coast, that they are the manufacturers of the largest assortment of trinkets in the Centennial,—then it seems to me that these men,—the ""Ashantees,"" the ""Accras,"" the ""Fantees,"" the ""Denkras,"" the ""Wassaws,"" the ""Assins,"" &c.,—should not be deprived of the meed of praise which belongs to them, but should receive the just reward for their great genius and their native art. I therefore, as an African, of which I am proud, having been born, bred and educated on that Coast, feel called upon to make this explanation. On several occasions while visiting the Centennial, I spent some time in explaining to the ladies and gentlemen who crowded around me that these trinkets were made by the native Africans, and I took great pains to impress upon their minds the capability and ingenuity of the native Africans. I would like very much that the words West Africa should be placed under the words Gold Coast, for many persons will think that the Gold Coast is in Australia or California, and thus deprive Africa of her just merits. Give to all nations, tribes, and people what is due to them. As a native of Africa, I return my sincere thanks to his Excellency Governor Strahan, C.M.G., Governor-in-Chief of the Gold Coast Colonies, for his activity and energy in having that part of Western Africa represented in this great ""World\'s Fair.""—Yours,', 'last_edit_date': '1876-10-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1876#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.607, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Native African Customs.—Advantages of British Protection', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Sir,—At Aburi a woman was murdered some four months ago, and nobody knew who was the culprit. The relations of this woman, who were of another town, Mampong, urged the King of Aburi to find out the murderer, else they would come and fight with the Aburi people. To find that person out they made shea butter hot and put it into a wooden bowl. A silver ring, which they put into the hot oil, had to be taken out first, by a representative of every family. The one whose hand was swollen was considered guilty, and that family brought to the ordeal man by man. It happened that the king's family was pointed out, and that four or five men of this family had swollen hands. They, of course were considered guilty. There was an order made before they tried this ordeal that nobody was permitted to rub himself with lemon juice. Now, there was a man who said, that in the night before the ordeal somebody had rubbed him with lemon juice; he did not know who it was, and could not help it. This was suspicious, and being closely questioned, his answers were not satisfactory. At length it turned out that he was the murderer, and not those men pointed out by the ordeal. He confessed his guilt to the missionary who visited him, and showed the place where he did it, and where a few bones were found, all\n**75**\n\n---\n\nthat remained from the poor woman.

Behind is a fine specimen of one of Mr. Du Chaillu\'s gorillas. The main exhibits in the lower gallery are arranged geographically in the numerous panels around the walls. On one side spears are the most conspicuous objects, and the variety of type is quite striking. We have spears from Somaliland, the Masai country, the Congo, Uganda, Swaziland, the Nyassa region, the Tanganyika region. Nearly all of these spears, as well as the other exhibits, have been collected by explorers whose names are famous, men like Livingstone, Speke and Grant, Stanley and Thomson, Johnston, and many missionaries; the officials of the Congo Free State, and others. Very varied are the types of axes, many of them of elaborate form. Bows and arrows are not numerous; but shields are plentiful and varied, and it is of interest to note that the Zulu shield extends to the latitude of Zanzibar, where we find a tribe long settled there, and yet retain many of the old Zulu customs. Some of the personal ornaments are most extraordinary. There are anklets like enormous brass plates, with a hole through the centre; others made of bars of copper, each over a pound weight.

The news of this commencement of hostilities was announced on the 28th, and followed by ten days\' festivities and fetish observances. At daybreak each morning the women paraded the town for a couple of hours, with three streaks of white paint down their foreheads, and howled for their husbands. The shout was anything but musical. They then retired for a few hours, and came out in full numbers about ten a.m. Then indeed was there a sight worth seeing. Each absent warrior had a representative in the person of his wife, or of a female slave dressed in male attire. The canoe-man\'s wife came out with a paddle; the bushman\'s with a long knife, the carpenter\'s with a saw, and the chieftain\'s with a birch broom to denote authority. A dreadful-looking woman, with a paper cocked hat on her head, and a cat-o\'-nine tails in her hand, was pointed out to me as \'Captain Glover;\' another, slightly less dreadful, as \'Mr. Goldsworthy.\' Lieutenants Larcom and Moor, Captain Sartorius and Mr. Blissett, appeared amongst the number. It was informed by Mrs. Addo, the hotel-keeper, that her slaves were dressed to dance for the officers of the expedition, as it was unlucky not to have some person specially appointed to appeal to the fetish for you. The enormous array danced for hours through the town, shouting songs of war and prayers for the defeat of the Acoosas and all their other enemies, going through the motions of trampling down the foe and cutting their throats, and finally supplicating the fetish for the return of their husbands and masters. So excited were they, that the perspiration poured off them; but they never once ceased dancing and shouting; their enthusiasm lending a wild melody to their notes of war or prayer. They kept excellent time withal with the war drums beaten by old women and young girls. Some of the cries they uttered are not within the compass of a white man\'s voice, and bore more resemblance to those of wild beasts. Woe betide the unfortunate man found lurking in the town when this procession comes round; his shoulders would soon feel the weight of the cat, and the paddles, and other weapons. The women drive every man to the war, and are more effectual than any police in clearing the town of any loafers.

The right honourable gentleman and yourself may not fully comprehend the meaning of this important point in the memorial, and be led to inquire what are the good effects which have been produced by those societies. I will explain. Between 1837 and 1841 the sitting magistrates at the Gambia were wearied with one complaint and one plea throughout the rainy seasons, when business is half closed, and no employment can be found for the lower class of workmen, such as labourers, &c. These men must live, and when they could not obtain their living honestly, they procured it by dishonesty, going about stealing from the merchants\' stores, &c., and when taken before the magistrates they pleaded not guilty, giving as their poor, groundless reason, ""that they were in want, and, having nothing to live upon, as there was no work to do in the rains, and no merchant willing to give them credit, they were obliged to rob."" The magistrates then saw the real wants of the people, and consulted a Wesleyan missionary (now in England) to see if he could manage some means of restraining those lawless characters. The rev. gentleman then called on one of his local brethren to see what could be done. They concluded to form a ""Workmen\'s Club"" for assisting each other throughout the rains. The local brother mustered the whole of his tribe and explained to them in their own language the shame and disgrace some had brought on themselves, &c. He then showed them the necessity for a Workmen\'s Club, for assisting each other in time of need. The proposal was unanimously voted; and thus the first Eboe society started in the year 1842. It consisted of both males and females, and up to this day a male member pays 1s., and a female 6d. per month. At the close of every meeting the members were warned to be honest, and informed that should they require any necessary assistance the club will be ready to meet their wants. In the course of two years the practices complained of were totally forgotten.

Most of the rooms are miserably small, dark, damp, and badly ventilated, especially those devoted to sleep. In their sleeping places the poorer classes, and many persons in better circumstances, keep all the dirty clothing not in wear either about their beds or hanging from the wall, scraps of food and putrid fish being strewed about or collected in corners. The lower rooms open into inner courts, where, in fine weather, the members of the several families meet, and where they often cook and eat their food. The houses of what may be termed the middling class are well furnished with European articles of cabinet furniture, with crockery, glass, and mirrors, while the walls are decorated with cheap prints. The wealthy native gentlemen (living in the seaboard towns) live in well-built houses, commodiously, and often elegantly, furnished; but few of them have fireplaces in the public rooms or bedrooms—a want which impairs health in a country exposed to heavy night-dews, and in some wet seasons to heavy falls of rain. The general custom on the Gold Coast is to burn charcoal in clay pots in the public rooms and bedrooms when the weather is damp or cold.

When the deceased is wealthy, valuable articles, as gold ornaments, gold dust, aggrey beads, are placed in the coffin, and the body is sprinkled with gold dust. These tombs in this way become family banks, and in the time of trouble the gold so deposited is applied to meet pressing claims or other family purposes.

Of all the peoples of Kenya, they put up the strongest and longest military resistance to British im› perialism; it began in the 1890s and did not end until their leader was murdered by the British commanders in 1905, on his way to the negotiations which had been treacherously arranged. That event weakened Nandi resistance and eventually led to the British occupation of their territory.\nThat the Nandi resisted the British for over seven years was due to the nature of their society. Nandi society was divided into territorial units called pororiet. Warriors from each unit were responsible for the defence of the territory. For this reason, the warriors slept in a common hut. This was the nearest thing to a standing army. These territorial armies came together under the leadership of an orgoiyot, or traditional leader. It was he who decided when the army would go on a raid. The armies were linked to him through a personal representative who sat at each territorial council. Because territory rather than clan was the centre of Nandi social life, this meant that clan rivalry was absent. The result was a cohesive society, and it was this cohesion that gave the society military superiority over its neighbours. Maison writes that 'It is surprising that so small a tribe as the Nandi was able to terrorize much larger peoples and to continue to do so almost with impunity for several decades.' 11 Given the social cohesion of the society as well as the confidence of the warriors both in themselves and in their leaders, it is not surprising that they became a military power to reckon with. Their military successes led them to believe that they were superior to other people, white men included. As G. W. B. Huntingford noted, 'The Nandi thinks himself at least the equal, if not the superior of the whiteman; and any estimate of the changes brought about by the impact of our civilization must be considered in the light of this fact'.$^{12}$ The Nandi successfully resisted this occupation for over seven years, then, because of the success with which the society had been knit together as a fighting force."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.573, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Back-to-Africa movements > The Afro-Brazilians', 'content': ""Trade between the two seaboards, apart from its importance as such, led to the emergence of an African bourgeoisie made up of former slaves from Brazil and Cuba.

Bringing with them their technical know-how, a few outstanding builders created residential districts in Porto Novo, Whydah and in particular Lagos, where the Brazilian Quarter$^{18}$ was built. Here, to this day, in what is now Tinubu Square and in Campos Square, storeyed houses reminiscent of those of Bahia can be found, as well as large buildings such as the Catholic cathedral of Lagos or the mosque erected in the town centre.

The invasion of wetter, tropical Africa by cultivated crops was less successful, although the locally domesticated yam was rain-tolerant and grew well enough on the forest margins as did the West African variety of rice. Early in the Christian era plants more suited to equatorial Africa, the banana (especially its large non-sweet variety, the plantain) and the Asian yam reached East Africa and slowly spread westward.$^{36}$ But the conquest of the forest was a long slow process and agriculture and population grew slowly within its confines, so slowly indeed that up to the fifteenth century the forested northerly part of the Congo basin seems to have been sparsely occupied by hunters and food-gatherers and considerable areas are still occupied by these people. 37 In terms of demographic history, the important point is that the forest was the home of very few people five hundred years ago. The major exceptions were the fringes, the coast and the important inter-regional routes.

In these states, age-mate initiation, although practised, was not exploited as an instrument for incorporating youths from conquered communities. These states were not essentially militaristic or expansionist. The campaigns they fought were either considered defensive, or essential for defining or delimiting the geographical boundaries of the state, or imperative for acquiring wealth in cattle. The founders of these states put much emphasis on strong defensible positions. Moshoeshoe built his capital on a flat-topped mountain (ghobosheane), Sobhuza located his capitals in inaccessible mountain areas, while Sebetwane chose the Kafue flood plain with its treacherous islands, a location that proved disastrous to unsuspecting enemies.\nThese defensive kingdoms did not maintain standing armies. Initiation age-mates functioned as military units in times of war. The kings inter› married extensively with their subjects to forge closer ties, especially with leading families, both in the core group and among the newly incorporated communities. Cattle were needed in order that they might be loaned out (the mafisa system) to favoured citizens or even whole chiefdoms. Consultation and local autonomy were much used to keep the disparate elements happy. These defensive states also attracted missionaries and strove hard to acquire guns and ammunition for defensive purposes. Even the conquest states ultimately admitted missionaries.\nAll these Mfecane states were founded on kinship as the basic social matrix on which the state was finally shaped. So was the institution of kingship. Both conquest and defensive states exploited the first-fruits ceremony as a ritual to stengthen the monarchy. With the evolution of the African state system of the Mfecane period the importance of kinship ties gradually gave way to service, functionality and territoriality. Some states, like the Kololo, insisted on a language policy for the whole kingdom. Others, like the Ndebele, did not impose a language policy but proficiency in the language of the rulers could be a golden key with which individuals could unlock doors to the corridors of power.

Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history.

To do this it is estimated that we shall require 300l.; a sum beyond what we can expect to raise among the native converts. Churches are not built by the Church Missionary Society; missionaries are obliged to obtain aid for such erections where they can. The native Christians have largely contributed to the restoration of the mission compound both in labour and material, and have restored the schoolroom so that it can be used as a temporary place of worship; more we cannot at present expect from them, especially as war and blockades have impoverished the country. The church was furnished with a turret clock, a bell for the clock, and another for calling the congregation together, and a harmonium, raised by subscriptions here, all of which have been destroyed; the communion plate was the only thing saved.

That on the 30th January, 1877, a conflagration of the nature above described took place, commencing from Ebute Ero district, where it broke out, and terminating at the Breadfruit district, occupying not less than three hours in continuous whirling flames, during which time a large number of houses, including churches and public buildings, and property, as also seven lives, were destroyed.\n\n3. That on the eventful occasion it was thought necessary that some steps should be taken, and that representation be made to the Governor, with a view to the devising of some scheme or plan whereby the frequent occurrence of fire might be checked. In pursuance of the resolution formed, an interview with His Excellency Sanford Freeling, C.M.G., Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Gold Coast Colony, was sought for and obtained, during his visit to this place, by a number of respectable gentlemen who waited upon him at Government House.\n\n4.

Efforts are made to improve, but not such as could be desired, from this cause. The system of building in large compounds is connected with the laws and superstitions of the country; a general change and improvement in house building will go hand in hand with changes in Government and religion. It would be very desirable, however, for Europeans to introduce better roofing materials. Now iron will not do unless it could be effectually lined by some non-conductor of heat and sound. A lining is again attended with this evil, that the space between becomes the resort of vermin. Some other material should be obtained; tiles would be better than iron, and good clay can be found everywhere; but there is no workman skilled in tile making to teach the natives, and no European has yet seriously attempted to introduce the art. A native, who returned from the Brazils, made a few and covered his own house in a rough way. He died without communicating his art to others. A great impediment exists in the fact, that it is apparently an easier and more genteel employment for lads to become clerks, or to do a little trade on their own account, than to engage in mechanical employments. The ease with which credit is obtained, which is again the result of large profits, produces a host of petty traders, who end in becoming hopelessly involved in debt, giving the white merchant reason to call the people dishonest. We have heard of industrial schools, but experience proves that it is far easier to teach reading and writing, and less expensive, than mechanical arts. It is quite a question ""whether skilled labour should not in good policy take the lead, and reading and writing follow after; if not in point of time, yet in point of importance.

This was absolutely necessary. Lagos is becoming a place of considerable trade. Our merchants' stores there are generally filled with valuable goods and produce. To insure these is out of the question; and every possible precaution ought to be insisted on by the Governor and Council to diminish the mercantile risk. Some of our friends have, we regret to say, had storehouses destroyed in the late conflagrations; but happily, the losses sustained by them, though vexatious, are not of a serious nature, all the principal stores having escaped; and if the proper measures be now adopted, as a consequence of these fires, the losses sustained in them will not be regretted.\n\nWe hope and believe that everything possible will be done for the embellishment as well as the security of Lagos.

Without this there can be no real security. Gunpowder is largely imported. It has been, and still is, lying about in stores and outhouses in all directions. The danger of such a course is obvious. It might have done very well when Lagos was nothing but an agglomeration of barbarian huts. But now that it is rising in wealth and importance—now that some of the merchants' stores contain many thousand pounds worth of produce—now that it is a seat of British authority—so improvident a system ought not to be tolerated.

Young, who lost everything, the Wesleyan chapel at Ogbe, but the house was saved; the house of Mr. Monday was burnt; Mrs. Gbambalas\' house was saved, but the thatch over the walls enclosing the premises was burnt. The fire passed over Shokore, a rapid stream in wet weather, but now dry, and ignited the extensive premises of Mr. Ribeiro, Madam Tinabu, Mr. Savage, and that of the West\n\nAfrican Company. The iron house of the West African Company was no protection; by some means the property stored inside caught fire and was entirely consumed. The large hydraulic cotton press of the West African Company, just completed, was destroyed, together with their oil and cotton. A quantity of oil belonging to Capt. Davies and Mr. H. Robbin was saved, from being stored at some little distance off and in the open air. Among the Sierra-Leone people who suffered were Mr. Savage, who is said to have lost 30,000 gallons of oil, Mr. Peter Rae 9,300 gallons of oil, Mr. Jas. George 4,560 gallons of oil, and 12 kegs of powder, Mr. J. Holloway 1,300 gallons of oil, and 319lbs. of cotton, Mr. C. N.

During the month of open river the West African Company sent down 700 bales of cotton and large quantities of oil, all of which, as well as the other 3,500 bales of cotton and quantities of oil, also sent down at the same time by other parties, would otherwise have been consumed.\n\nWe cannot conclude this notice without saying how much we sympathise with those whose property has been thus destroyed.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-03-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1865#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.609, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CAMEROONS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We learn from Cameroons, under date of Nov. 29, that the mission house erected by the Rev.

A meeting has subsequently been held, and a heavy reward offered for the discovery and apprehension of the offender or offenders. The escape of the occupants of the house is nothing short of miraculous; as, had the discovery of the fire, which had been applied to the thatch of an outbuilding immediately adjoining the house, taken place even five minutes later than it did, the whole of the roof would have ignited, and the woodwork being very dry, would have burnt with such rapidity, that many lives, especially of native children, of whom there were thirty or forty in the house, must have been lost.

I have proposed to him an iron roof to be covered with slate, to which he replies that he would immediately take to it, if he only could be sure that lightning would not harm the building. In this he is quite right. We have fearful thunderstorms on the mountains, and the large trees, acting as conductors, have nearly all disappeared. Now the question is, will not such a large quantity of iron attract the electric fluid, and act as a conductor to the destruction of the building? Will lightning rods do their work sufficiently to keep the building safe? Will not, if a thunderstorm come during a service, the danger increase that people might be struck? To decide these questions we should have something like statistics, which perhaps those could furnish who are constructing such buildings. Military engineers could, perhaps, give explanation.

A recent strike of the police force was caused by an endeavour being made to compel the police to perform fire brigade duty in addition to their ordinary avocation. Recently, on a fire occurring in the Hausa quarters, great difficulty was experienced in getting the engine out of the Custom House building, and in the interval no fewer than thirty-six houses were burned down. It was then decided to remove the fire engine to the public works, where it could be got at any moment. The authorities also considered that the police ought to perform the fire brigade duty, and for this they agreed to give them extra pay in the shape of overtime. The police objected to the overtime, and as the result refused to perform duty. There was no alternative but to get them arrested by the Hausas. After imprisoning the ringleaders, an arrangement was come to by which the police are to act as a reserve fire brigade. Fifteen men are detailed weekly for the duty, to be succeeded the following week by fifteen others. The fact, however, of the police objecting to obey orders gave the authorities the impression that they could not be relied upon, and on this account the desire for the return of the 300 Hausas sent down to the Gold Coast from Lagos was expressed.—The work of constructing the new railway was stopped when the Loanda passed. This was on account of the rains, but there had also been a number of deaths.

Mr. W. Shalford, M.Inst.

This steady extension of European contacts and influence inland included not only guns and powder, but also railways, telegraphs, agricultural and mining machinery, the print› ing press, technical education and, above all, finance capital. These new developments created opportunities, but also challenges and dangers. Among the most novel and interesting features of African history during the period were the initiatives and reactions of African rulers and advisers in the face of these opportunities and challenges. It would appear that in most cases the approach of the Africans was not simply one of blind imitation or wholesale substitution but rather one of adaptation and syn› thesis. Instances of this process of modernization in Africa are legion. 56 Egypt built its first printing press at Büläk, Cairo, in 1822; the first printing press was established in Portuguese Luanda in 1841; the first modern mines were opened in Algeria in 1845 and in the Gold Coast in the 1870s. Some of the states, such as Ethiopia and Tunisia, embarked on public works; nearly all the Barbary states, as well as Egypt reformed their monetary systems. Other states, such as Egypt, set up textile and cotton mills, saw mills, glassworks and paper mills, all during the reign of Muhammad 'AIL But more interesting and of far-reaching consequence was the moder› nization process in the military sphere. In the face of steady European encroachment, many African states, especially in North and West Africa, modernized the organization, training, equipment and recruitment of their armies. As will be seen in later chapters, Morocco, for instance, set up at Fez an engineering school to train artillery men, surveyors, and car› tographers and sent soldiers abroad for training.

Similarly, Oyo cultural influences found in eastern Yorubaland - worship of Sango, the spread of the men's loom, shoulder sling drums - must be considered not so much as evidence of Oyo hegemony before 1800 as of the nineteenth-century diaspora of the Oyo following the fall of the empire. 38 A similar influence from Benin, especially on court ceremonials, regalia and chieftaincy titles in Qwo, Ekiti, Akoko, Ondo, Ijesa - as among the Awori astride the present-day Nigeria-Benin border - showed the widespread effect of the theme of inter-group penetration and com› mensurate institutional adaptation.

But the march of events is developing the interesting fact that there is a career before this people which no other people can enter upon. There is a peculiar work for them to accomplish, both in the land of their bondage, and in the land of their fathers, which no other people can achieve. With the present prospects and privileges before his race - with the chances of arduous work, noble suffering, and magnificent achievement before them - I would rather be a member of this race than a Greek in the time of Alexander, a Roman in the Augustin period, or an AngloSaxon in the nineteenth century. 46 It was also Blyden who in his famous speech to the American Col› onization Society in May 1880 gave great publicity to the phrase 'Ethiopia Stretching Out her Hands Unto God' and equated Ethiopian with African; and it was he who first used the term 'African personality' in his lecture delivered on 19 May 1893 in Freetown when he described the African Race as 'a Great Race - great in its vitality, in its power of endurance and its prospect of perpetuity'. He continued: It is sad to think that there are some Africans, especially among those who have enjoyed the advantages of foreign training, who are so blind to the radical facts of humanity as to say, 'Let us do away with the sentiment of Race. Let us do away with our African personality and be if possible in another Race ... Preach this doctrine as much as you like, no one will do it, for no one can do it, for when you have done away with your personality, you have done away with yourselves ... the duty of every man, of every race is to contend for its individuality to keep and develop it ...

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure.

They also set themselves the task of refuting and disproving racist ideas and practices in a series of articles, pamphlets, books and speeches, and it was this that gave rise to the second of the unique processes of the period, namely, the intellectual revolution and the accompanying birth of African racial consciousness, pan-Africanism and the concept of the African personality. The pioneers of this revolution in West Africa were undoubt› edly James Africanus Horton (1835-83) and Edward Wilmot Blyden (18321912). Among the works of Horton on the themes in question were Political Economy of British Western Africa, with the requirements of the several colonies and settlements: An African view of the Negro place in Nature (1865); West African Countries and Peoples: A Vindication of the African Race (1868); and Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast (1870). In West African Countries and Peoples, Horton refuted the idea of inherent racial inferiority of the black man by arguing that the difference in the stages of civilization between whites and blacks arose 'entirely from the influence of external circumstances'. To those who moved from the assump› tion of racial inferiority of the black to the assumption that he would ultimately disappear from the face of the earth in the face of white power, Horton argued: we find that wherever the African race has been carried to ... they increase, no matter under what depressing and burdensome yoke they may suffer; from which it may be safely inferred that the African people is a permanent and enduring people, and the fancies of those who had determined their destruction will go in the same limbo as the now almost defunct American slavery. 40 Finally, in answer to the proposition that the black was incapable of improvement, he argued: 'Africans are not incapable of improvement, but that by the assistance of good and able men they are destined to figure in the course of time, and to take a prominent part in the history of the civilized world'.$^{41}$ Again in his Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast, Horton wrote in the Preface: Horton not only condemned racism but was also one of the earliest advocates of pan-Africanism.

In Yorubaland, for example, there was a remarkable interpØnØtration and mixing of the several sub-ethnic groups. Here the most spectacular effect was produced by the Oyo, whose diaspora began in the first two decades of the century when the forces of instability were unleashed on the capital of the old empire. By 1830, the main centres in which Oyo migrants settled had included Ibadan, Ijaye and present-day Oyo town, north of Ibadan. However, it was Ibadan imperialist expansion between the 1840s and 1860s that led to the full flowering of the Oyo diaspora. As a result, several Oyo communities moving in from the north-west were established among the Igbomina, Ijesa, Ekiti, Akoko, Ondo, Ikale and Ilaje sub-culture areas of eastern and south-eastern Yorubaland.$^{36}$ Conversely, eastern Yoruba groups such as the Ekiti and Ijeça came as captives or freedmen to Ibadan and several other settlements in Osun, Ijebu and the Egba areas in the west and south.

In the area of Old Qyo, which exemplified the huge loss of population involved, established towns includ› ing the ancient Oyo city itself, Igboho, Ikoyi, Igbon, Iresa and Oje were destroyed. Beyond that, other Yoruba towns destroyed included Sabe, Ketu, Owu and a whole series of Egba and related Remo communities.

The coast and its immediate hinterland, which in c. 1800 was generally sparsely populated, became an area of teeming population at the close of the period.\nIn the Aja-speaking area, the general direction of population movement was south-eastward. In the nineteenth century, Aja refugees from the Werne river valley and the Porto Novo region swelled the ranks of related communities that had earlier settled in the adjacent parts of the presentday Lagos State and Ogun State of Nigeria following the Dahomeyan conquest of the coastal Aja states of Aliada and Whydah in 1724 and 1727 respectively.$^{27}$ This extension of the Aja culture area eastwards was a significant contribution of the nineteenth-century wars to ethnic interpenetration in the area under study."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The new changes resulted from a combination of factors, including the nineteenth-century wars which, as in Yorubaland, had the effect of ren› dering the coastal areas relatively safe and attractive to migration from the hinterlands in which most of the fighting took place; the sea-borne trade which was rendered permanent by the transition from slave to 'legitimate' trade, thereby conferring a definite economic advantage on the coastal regions; and the steady growth of European interest, which enlarged the traditional role of selected coastal towns such as Lagos, Porto Novo and eventually Cotonou to take on new and increasing responsibilities not only as ports but also as political capitals of emergent colonial states and their independent African successors.\nIn all these changes, however, the economic factor would appear to have been the most dominant, especially with reference to the European presence. Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

Within two generations, there developed a network of social and cultural relation› ships through which goods and services circulated with remarkable efficiency. New migrants like the mukama Womunafu and his entourage brought a stock of goods, skills and new technologies; the demand for specialized goods like ironware, especially farming implements, pottery and salt led to occasional fairs to which people brought their surplus produce such as barkcloth, skins and live animals in exchange; others took their produce to the locations of known specialist craftsmen like blacksmiths, fishermen and potters. Similarly, goods and services circulated through payments for rituals and worship, or in payment of bride price and other social dues, and even in raiding, stealing and kidnapping. As Cohen has put it, his study \'offers a series of images of a regional economy of the unadministered zone in the early nineteenth century structured not upon the ""channeled effect"" associated with international and interregional trade but structured, rather, upon a remarkably extensive and thickly knit network of circulation, distribution and redistribution."" 9 The nineteenth century brought changes, new pressures and oppor› tunities even for the people in Bunafu, as in other places. As the family expanded, land hitherto regarded as marginal began to be cultivated. New crops hitherto regarded with caution were experimented with and some became new staples. The \'economic horizon\' of the villagers expanded as the trame strengthened the links that stretched from the villages to the coastal ports and overseas markets. Expansion of trade brought social and political changes. Initially, it tended to strengthen the position of chiefs who found it easier to accumulate wealth from taxing trade in salt, iron and copper, not to mention ivory, beeswax and palm oil, than from tribute in agricultural produce and customary labour. At the same time the profits of trade could not be so easily monopolized. Several individuals moved away from their customary locations to seek their fortunes, and social mobility was thus facilitated. But these changes were slow and represented not so much innovation as expansion of tendencies and patterns already evident by the eighteenth century.

They tend to be theoretical and ideological, contributing more to the debate about underdevelopment than to an understanding of the historical development of African agriculture in the early nineteenth century.

There are only a handful of studies based on empirical data that show how particular agricultural communities in different parts of Africa functioned and developed in the early nineteenth century. They do not yet provide a basis for regional surveys of African agriculture, let alone a continental synthesis. However, they do provide necessary insights for re-examining the main characteristics of the agricultural base of African societies and the factors of historical change operating within them."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 122, 'article_title': 'Commodore Wilmot’s Visit to Dahomey', 'full_section_title': 'Commodore Wilmot’s Visit to Dahomey', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1863#article-1', 'issue_date': '23_03_1863', 'content': 'We are sorry to announce that we have not received any written details of Commodore Wilmot’s visit to Abomey.

Coffee Binfoo must remember, when we had occasion to warn him we sent direct to him; and when we found that R. B. N.

Now, if Mr. N. Walker takes lease of any portion of that Attawa-Assie property, he does it to his great risk, as we have distinctly given him to understand that owing to his conduct we will not allow him an inch of that property.

Some of the children had their heads shaved, and their bare polls were smeared like their faces, breasts, and arms. The female Fantee is not sparing of her charms. This was a custom held in honour of a man who had died several months ago, leaving much property to his relatives. In gratitude for this, they had worn mourning for the deceased for a long time, and now they appeared in chalk and white raiment as a formal sign that the period of mourning was at an end. Part of this ceremony consisted in carrying a live child in a coffin. After all this, they went down to the beach and bathed. Abstinence from bathing on alternate days is one of the mourning customs here, and the women now bathed to show that the time of abstinence was over. It may sound heartless to find food for amusement in the funeral customs of people, but a man cannot be expected to feel more affected than the mourners themselves, and many of the girls who parade the streets in procession, with much howling and clapping their hands, break into a smile if they catch the eye of a white man as they pass. Some few of the near relations manage to pump up tears, but it is clear that the sobbing is done with an effort. In plain fact, it is quite out of the question to expect a negro to be otherwise than happy when he is enjoying rum and row combined.\n\nPerhaps, next to a negro funeral, the most comical thing is a negro letter.

At Bendi, too, is held a sort of fetish court of appeal, to which Natives of the coast towns and of the interior repair for settlement of their differences.

Before the annexation of Lagos to the British Crown, Abeokuta had become remarkable among the African countries for the great and rapid increase of its production and trade. Abeokuta was immeasurably the largest exporter of cotton in native Africa; her palm oil trade with Lagos was considerable, and other commerce prospered. With the annexation of Lagos to Great Britain, we looked naturally for a still greater increase of production and trade; and we have no doubt that such results would have been obtained but for the native wars, which have so interfered with agricultural pursuits, and the differences with Lagos on the part of the Egbas, which had their origin principally in those wars.

In former times sufficient attention was not always given by the authorities to the suitability of candidates for employment in the minor posts in these then much despised West African possessions. But all this has greatly changed. The growing importance of the West African trade, and the general éclaircissement which followed the operations of the Ashanti War, have brought about a different spirit in the administration of these colonies, and the present colonial service in West Africa is not inferior to any other branch of the service in other parts of the world, and of late has furnished a considerable proportion of remarkable men who have distinguished themselves on the West Coast of Africa, and have been raised to posts of great influence and distinction elsewhere. I think, however, that decidedly more might be done to encourage such work as I have referred to in Lagos, namely, a thorough and scientific examination of the natural history and ethnology of these lands, so that we can be better guided in our administration of them, both by increasing our knowledge of their natural resources and by becoming more acquainted with the character of the races whom we are to rule. Especially should the learning of native languages be fostered among colonial officers. This movement has been already begun on the Gold Coast by Sir Brandford Griffith, and in Lagos by Captain Moloney, but I do not think any official steps have been taken in the matter. In nearly all the great divisions of Africa there is some lingua Franca—some widespread language of general use among native traders, or the ruling caste, which would be understood everywhere, from Benin to Old Calabar, and up the Niger to its confluence with the Benue; the Yoruba tongue, which is prevalent throughout Logos colony and right away to the kingdom of Nupe; the Hausa language, which is a good deal spoken in the Gold Coast colony, and which is one of the leading tongues of the Niger basin; the Mandingo, which is widely spread as a commercial language over the Sierra Leone colony; and the Wolof, which is much spoken on the Gambia. In the learning of each one of these languages in their respective spheres of influence colonial officers should be encouraged by small bounties or some palpable reward. These languages are simple in construction, and are illustrated by grammars and dictionaries published by the various missionary societies.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.617, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Hausa Language and People', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Rev. C. H. Robinson then delivered a most interesting address as to the progress he had already made in acquiring the Hausa language, and his plan of operation in the future. He said the great reason why this work had not before been undertaken was the fact that the country was cut off from civilisation by the two great barriers of the Sahara and the Niger, the latter necessitating the missionary passing through a long belt of malarial country. The language was spoken by no less than 15,000,000 people, and while recently staying in Tripoli he had gathered that there were large colonies of these people in all the North African towns, and there was a constant stream of pilgrims from Hausaland passing across Central Africa on their way to Mecca. It was impossible to estimate the number of these pilgrims, but it was not uncommon to see as many as a thousand coming to Tripoli in a single day. These Hausas were far from being uncivilised savages, and they lived in comparatively well built towns, one of which had a wall around it of fifteen miles, and had a population of over 100,000, with very considerable manufactories for making Native cloth. As compared with all other Natives of Central Africa, they were a very highly educated race, and a large proportion of the children were taught to read and write. This had only lately been discovered, but it was found that they had an alphabet of their own, though borrowed from the Arabic, while there was also a considerable amount of Native literature in existence. They valued books very much, their wealth in some cases being reckoned by the number of books they possessed, and under no circumstances would they destroy a book or piece of writing which they could understand. They wrote and read something like the Chinaman, but it appeared that they only valued manuscript works, and looked upon printed Arabic as unreal, so that probably it would be found necessary in first introducing books into the country to either have them lithographed or printed with some kind of type which would very much resemble ordinary writing. They were only nominal Mohammedans, the greater part having become so in the early portion of this century. They were very anxious to learn, and willingly read every book that was put in their way. It was a satisfactory feature, too, that religious fanaticism was unknown amongst this great people. They were going up the river Niger as far as its confluence with the Benue, and then up part of the latter, striking out for the town of Karno. They intended to stay in that place for about six months in the direct study of the Hausa people and language, for they were anxious to collect Native traditions and specimens of Native literature, in order to try and discover the origin of the language and of the people themselves. The fact that the Hausa language was so intimately connected with Arabic would make the work much easier, and they also intended to visit several other towns in the country. On their return they would travel through the Sahara, as the route was very interesting, though monotonous, and was considered the most healthy.', 'last_edit_date': '1894-07-13', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1894#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.624, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Languages of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The volumes lately published by Mr. Robert N.

Some have the entire New Testament, as the Herrero, the language which serves the Rhenish Society, north of Bushman-land. Others have as yet only smaller portions. Probably no other African language attracts more attention now than the Swahili, of which the missionary Krapf left an elaborate dictionary, and of which Mr. Cust expresses the opinion that it ""is, and is destined to continue, one of the twelve most important languages of the world, with reference to the vast area over which it is the lingua franca.""—Foreign Missionary.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1887#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.619, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LAGOS, ABEOKUTA, AND IBADAN.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'But, returning to the subject of direct and unfettered communication between Lagos and Ibadan, we ask whether the facts stated in ""D.

The civilization, the Christianizing, the development of the resources of the populous and productive interior, must depend greatly on these. Roads, roads, roads, and the navigation of rivers, is still our cry, and still our demand for Africa. Much might be done from Sierra Leone; much from Cape Coast, Accra, and other towns on the seaboard of the Gold Coast; and much, we hope and believe, will ere long be done from Lagos. We know how to estimate, alas! but too well, all the difficulties that oppose and impede. But we know that the interior of those countries cannot be civilised, or obtain the development of their resources, without such aids; and as we believe that Christianity and civilization will prevail there, we feel assured that those aids will sooner or later be enjoyed. Yoruba has advantages over many other portions of Western Africa. She possesses a good and strong breed of horses, and we may certainly be pardoned, even by the greatest anthropological hater of Africans, for an earnest desire to have palm oil and cotton drawn to the coast by these instead of being borne day after day in journeys of from four to ten days on the heads of women, who may be carrying at the same time an infant at the breast.

The Archibongs, before leaving for the markets, obtained from Orok, its keeper, a composition made of rotten eggs and dirty water, on pretext that they wanted it for the Eyambas. You may imagine superstitious Orok\'s horror when he heard that they sprinkled the potent liquid round their houses and on the streets to protect them from his wiles. Orok can never walk the Mbiam streets for fear of being struck down dead. Archibong Edem promises to continue a barbarous, oppressive heathen. If his slave-women do not go to the old mission church, they are fined; and if his slave-boys attempt to teach themselves the alphabet, they are also fined. The poor oppressed slaves long for the day of liberation, which, it is to be hoped, is not far distant. A heathen of the Archibong type, because one of his people would not go to the old mission church, but to Mr. Ross\'s, compelled him to carry thirteen cannon balls, one piece of flint, and two guns, through the town for half a day in drenching rain. The poor fellow often fell to the ground under his heavy load. We do not hear anything about electing a king by the chiefs, who are still divided amongst themselves as to the individual on whom they should confer this honour. It is well known that Orok still thirsts for the honour, although he has been made a fool by the European traders, when, two years ago, they induced a rum-seller\'s clerk, the then Acting Consul, to put a tinselled hat on his head for a crown, and, to complete the farce, invited a missionary to bless him, who shortly before implored heaven not to make him king. Orok since that time is inwardly angry with Makara for having made a fool of him, and is not so ready to take their advice. Knowing, as I do, what kind of advice white men and some missionaries give Orok, and what example they set before him, I wonder he is not worse. Orok lately asked his servant, ""How can Makara take Sacrament, and then come to my yard and commit sin?"" Orok, five weeks ago, restored 80l. he had extorted from Anquai by oppression. If from principle, well; if not, not so good.

Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

The immaterial part of man (the soul) survived him after death, while the material part (the body) disintegrated after death. Death therefore did not end life; it was an extension of life. The dead remained members of society and there was believed to be a community of the dead alongside the community of the living, and there was a symbiotic relationship between the two communities.

For society was based more on obligation than on individual rights and an individual assumed his rights in the exercise of his obligations, which made society a chain of interrelationships. Furthermore, human life was viewed and understood as a cycle of birth, puberty, marriage and procreation, death and the afterlife.

Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses.

The music entered wholly into social life, penetrating it so thoroughly that it became indispensable to the various activities of healing, weddings, funerals, field labour, birth, initiations and a host of other social undertakings. The mbira instrument itself was held 'capable of projecting its sound to heaven and linking up with the world of spirits' and therefore, in effect, linked the activities and the thoughts of the living with the presence of their ancestors.\nThe performers were both settled and itinerant; they did not always wait upon invitations, although notable mbira players have been hired from distances of hundreds of miles either for their sheer artistic reputation, or because their style of playing was considered best suited to a desired end - usually the successful possession of a medium. It can be observed that a culturally cohesive community was maintained in this way, across geographical boundaries. The night-long bira ceremonies which moved early into the possession of the medium, thereafter into the purely social pleasures of dancing, singing, poetic (including comic) recitals and mimicry, have been aptly described as 'a long, communal journey through the night'.

As to the condition of the great majority of the inhabitants, no language can convey an adequate idea of the state of filth, squalor, and positive barbarism in which they are immersed. No attempt seems to have been made on the part of the Government to improve their condition. I do not attribute blame to any one in particular, and I hope your lordship will not consider that I intend to make any personal animadversions. The difficulties in the way, however, as far as I can see, are simply of a pecuniary nature. The available funds have been insufficient, hitherto, to allow any material progress being made. The Government grant of 4,000l. a-year is scarcely sufficient to pay the civil staff required here. The revenue, I believe, is now very small. Thus between both sources just enough is got to keep Her Majesty's servants here with *fine titles*, &c., but without money to make any public improvements or really to do any good. Surely it would be worth while for the Government to give an extra 2,000l. a-year to be applied solely for improving the place and civilising the people. The authorities here are, I believe, considering some means of raising additional revenue in the settlement, by imposing a duty on the retail of wines and spirits, and rendering it necessary for the keepers of houses in which these things are sold to take out licences. Advocates and attorneys have also now to take out licences, for which they have each to pay five guineas a-year. This will not bring in much, I should think—but every little counts; while, for other reasons, this measure seems to have been desirable. It is also proposed to make some change as regards native burials. The natives here are in the habit of burying their dead within their houses. You may imagine what a nice place the centre of a cemetery must be to live in in a hot climate like this, and I can say that we are at the present moment doing nothing else. Nor is this the fault altogether of the natives. I understand that they would willingly conform to any rule we may make to prohibit them doing so for the future, and that they do so now principally for the want of some safe and proper place of burial elsewhere. As to the Colonial or Government Burial-ground, it is in the very centre of the town, and to windward of the best part of it, as animadverted on by Dr. Clarke. It is not longer than an ordinary country churchyard, and it is at present so full, that they are burying persons only three feet deep. I hear that there is some intention of issuing an order that in future all persons must be buried in a new burial-ground, which was purchased some time ago, and which has not yet been consecrated. Contrary, however, to the express recommendation of Dr. Clarke, this also is to windward of the town. It is small, and, I fear, would soon be filled up; and a proper cemetery ought to be made to leeward. I hear also that the military authorities are going to build a military hospital near the present Parade-ground.""}, {'id': 405, 'article_title': 'GENERAL OBSERVATIONS', 'full_section_title': 'GENERAL OBSERVATIONS', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1864#article-16', 'issue_date': '23_07_1864', 'content': 'We publish on another page a paper printed and circulated by the Church Missionary Society, with the object of obtaining contributions to the ""West African Native Bishopric Fund.""

K. Lynch, of Bagdad, who many years since organised a company which runs steamers on the Euphrates, and conveys the mails between Bassorah and Bagdad under a subsidy from the English Government, gives evidence as to the nature and progress of the trade of the country. ""When we first established trade on the Euphrates,"" writes Mr. Lynch, ""we put on one steamer, and thought that would be sufficient. Afterwards we were obliged to put on another, and since that time the Turkish local government have put on four, and I believe that they will all have sufficient to do. Bagdad is supplied with English manufactures direct from London to the Persian Gulf, and from Bussorah to Bagdad. As a return traffic from the North from Moosul we get galls and wool, from Persia we get tobacco and cotton, and from around Bagdad towards Bussorah we get wool, cotton, rice, and dates, which are exported in large quantities to England. I look upon the establishment of a railway in those countries as the commencement of a kingdom.

The southern part of the new burial-ground has no wall, and the Hon.

The Secretary of State\'s despatch, dated January 15, 1874, distinctly states that all the graveyards are to be closed; but the Council here says only the old one at present. Why not close both at the same time, if they are to be closed? and if because no new cemetery is made in which to deposit the dead, why do not the Government allow both to be used, or to remain open until a new cemetery be made, and when closed, both to be closed at the same time; not to close the best and leave the worst!

We were staying at the private residence of Captain Mansell, who is head of the Mounted Police Force, resident in the Reserve. We arrived on Thursday, February 7, but, as it was raining and a heavy mist falling, we saw nothing that day, but in the evening heard a great deal of singing at the kraal where the King died, which is only a few hundred yards from Captain Mansell\'s. On the 8th, at half-past eleven a.m., we called on Mr. Osborne, the British Resident (who lives about midway between Captain Mansell\'s and the kraal), asking if he had any objection to our visiting Cetewayo. His reply was, \'Provided our visit was not a political one, he could have no objection.\' We then proceeded to the kraal, meeting outside, firstly, Umdabuka (Cetewayo\'s next brother), then Mahanana, Shingana, and Dabulamanzi, all sons of Panda. They evinced some curiosity as to who we were, and as to the object of our visit; but upon my informing them that I had seen their King at the Cape, and later on in England, they were satisfied, and then informed us that Cetewayo was bathing at a stream hard by, but that, as he took a long time in performing his ablutions, we had better return in the afternoon. They were certainly the four largest men we had ever seen together, whose weight (I should think) could not be under eighteen stone each. We left at one p.m. precisely, and returned to the hospitable quarters from whence we came. At four p.m., Captain Mansell, Messrs. Acutt, Addison, and myself, drove to the military camp, about a mile and a half distant, beautifully situated on the Eshowe heights. At a quarter-past five p.m., whilst watching the British officers play polo, Nkosana, one of Cetewayo\'s favourite chiefs, who accompanied him to England, came to the Resident, asking for a doctor, as he said the King was ill. The military doctor, Captain Liddel, and Mr. Addison started as soon as possible. We left at half-past six p.m., intending then to make our call upon the King, but were met at a distance of a quarter of a mile from the royal residence by Dr. Scott and Captain Liddel, returning, who informed us that \'Cetewayo was dead, and must have been so two hours, for the body was nearly cold, and the doctor gave it as his opinion that the cause of death was fatty degeneration of the heart.\' Instead of the sounds of mirth and revelry which met our ears the night before, we heard nothing but hideous shrieks of woe and discord from the numerous relatives and inhabitants of the kraal. The usual ceremony of transporting the hut for burning, and carrying away the earth on which it stood, was performed on Saturday, the 9th, and we were present at it. This was the hut in the Police Fort which was occupied by Cetewayo previous to his departure for the kraal where he died. Superintending this ceremony was his favourite chief, Incozane, who recognized me, and, after taking a pinch of snuff, conversed freely. He informed us that Cetewayo had merely had a slight bilious attack the day before his death, and that on his return from bathing he lay down, and never awoke. This is nearly all that is likely to interest you, excepting that I may add, the coffin was in the course of construction, when we left, from some packing-cases of Captain Mansell\'s, the only timber to be found at Eshowe, the dimensions of which were, height 3ft. 3in. by 3ft. by 3ft. This extraordinary measurement of a coffin is accounted for by the fact that the natives bury their dead in a sitting position.'}, {'id': 5858, 'article_title': 'A Terrible Story from the West Coast', 'full_section_title': 'A Terrible Story from the West Coast', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1889#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_07_1889', 'content': 'The British & African Steam Navigation Company\'s Royal Mail steamer Congo has recently brought to England a most revolting story of barbarism and brutality.

There traders were aware that for a short time after the old King\'s death the ""Iu Iu"" rites were performed; but they thought that these were over. But they found to their horror that the ""Iu Iu"" ceremonies were at their highest when they entered Eboe Town. These rites had been in operation for about two months, and already about forty people had been slain to appease the ""Iu Iu"" gods. The old King was then lying in a grave which had been dug for him. The hole was large and deep. Lying in the same grave were nine of the King\'s youngest wives, and their deaths had been brought about in the most cruel manner. Each of them had her wrists and ankles broken, so that they could neither walk nor crawl. In this state, and suffering the most excruciating pain, the unfortunate creatures were placed at the bottom of the grave, seven of them lying side by side. The body of the King was laid on them in a transverse direction; the two remaining women were laid down by the side of the King, lying exactly like the Monarch\'s body. No food or water was given to the poor creatures, who were left in that position to die. It is said that death did not, as a rule, take place for four or five days.

This is the second event of the kind which has happened within a very brief period, though in the previous case the loss of life was very much less. Particulars of the catastrophe have reached Liverpool, from which it appears that a train travelling from Emposi to Matadi with a number of Europeans and Natives in it collided with a waggon containing fifty-four boxes of dynamite and eighty-two barrels of gunpowder, which was to have been attached to the rear part of the train. A fearful explosion followed. The report was heard down at Matadi, and for many miles along the banks of the river. The car with the explosives had disappeared, and in its place was a huge excavation like a ravine, the rails of the line being twisted into all shapes. The engine itself was turned completely round and destroyed, while piled on top of it were the carriages containing most of the passengers. The officials from Matadi, hearing the terrific noise and guessing its cause, made all speed to the spot. The British & African Steam Navigation steamer Lualaba was also lying at Matadi, and Captain Murray with his officers and the ship’s doctor, hastened to the scene of the catastrophe. The only doctor of the place was in the train, and he was seriously injured. The surgeon of the British steamer rendered all assistance in his power, and the wounded and the dying were carried to a temporary hospital. Three of the white officials were killed outright, whilst a fourth—M. Legene, the head of the Société Anonyme Belge—succumbed to his injuries on the following day. From the bodies and the portions of the human remains collected after the disaster it was computed that about twenty blacks and four whites had been killed by the explosion, but on a count being made next day twenty-six others were missing, and it is feared that these had been hurled into the Congo and been carried away. The people of Matadi were most thankful for the efforts of the English crew, the doctor of the steamer being particularly energetic in rendering medical aid to the sufferers.

Miss Kingsley stated that after reaching Old Calabar she proceeded to the French settlement of Gaboon, and made it known that she wished to explore the gorilla country, in the interior of the Gaboon territory, and also to go up the Ogowe River to N\'Djole, a distance of 206 miles. After much difficulty she got together a canoe\'s crew of eight natives, and started for the rapids. The canoe journey was a long one, and nearly a dozen times the craft was upset and its occupants were thrown into the water. The current was strong, and Miss Kingsley had several narrow escapes, being saved more than once by clutching the rocks in the rapids, and by holding on to them until the Natives righted the canoe. It was remarkable that none of the crew lost their lives; but once one man was missing for a few hours after a capsize, and was found perched on one of the pinnacled rocks in the rapids.\n\nMiss Kingsley had the most remarkable adventures in the Fangwe country, while travelling overland from the Ogowe River to the Rembwe.

As the little band approached each town its progress was constantly impeded by man-traps; at almost every town the Fangwes stopped the expedition, and wanted to eat the three Fangwe elephant-men. They said they had no ""palaver"" with Miss Kingsley, but they must have the Fangwes, as they were enemies. Miss Kingsley had guaranteed the elephant-men\'s safety; so, sometimes, by persuasion, sometimes by threatening the tribesmen with punishment by the French, and sometimes by a little present, the men were each time saved. Miss Kingsley did not come across one burial-place in the Fangwe country; but she found that in most of the native mud huts, pieces of human beings were being kept, just as civilised people keep fresh meat and other eatables in their larders.\n\nMiss Kingsley saw many large gorillas, but these invariably made off on the approach of the band.

Unfortunately, owing to obstructions placed in the way by the said King, we were unable to procure carriers and had to wait several days at Gwatto. Mr. Blair, as perhaps you will remember, fell ill, and the visit had to be abandoned, and we returned to the river. About two years later, accompanied by Mr. Bey, of the firm of Bey & Rimmer, of Hamburg, and Mr. H. Farquhar, then agent for Messrs. A. Miller Bros. & Co., I visited Benin city. We took our own carriers, so were in no way dependent upon the King. Just outside the city we had to pass through a common about a mile long by about 200 yards wide. In this place we found a number of dead bodies quite close to the footpath. They had evidently died a violent death, as their heads were, in some cases, severed from their bodies, and in others the skulls were smashed in. We did not linger to examine many, as the stench was overpowering; in fact, even the Natives had to put cloths to their noses while passing through. A little further on we came across the body of a woman crucified and placed upon sticks about fifteen feet from the ground. Upon inquiring the meaning of this we were told that it was usual to crucify a virgin in time of drought, and an old woman when they had too much rain. These are facts that can be verified, as Dr. Hanley visited the city some years after and photographed some of these sights and had them published in one of the London illustrated papers. A little further on we saw a sort of platform slightly inclined and fixed between trees and about twenty feet from the ground. Upon this were quite a number of bodies and skeletons in all stages of decomposition. This, I believe, was also photographed and published by Dr. Hanley. During our stay (three days) in the city we had several messages, supposed to come from the King, to the effect that as the chiefs were out killing we were on no account to allow our black carriers outside the compound after dark, and strongly advised us, the whitemen, to remain in also, it being the custom that promotion from rank to rank is attained by killing a certain number of men. This is accomplished by way-laying after dark. It is also the custom for the King to kill yearly a large number of slaves to celebrate the anniversary of his father\'s death.

This evil custom is but too well known of by the educated natives of Accra, men who think themselves better than the other classes in the town; and it is strange that these educated natives should have so long kept silence, and not said a single word in the public papers against the atrocious evil and fetish customs which disgrace their town and country. May I ask, do these scholars patronize civilization and colonization as Lagos and Sierra Leone did? I answer, they do not; because they will not point out or will not speak to the authorities or in the public papers of the great obstacle (foolish heathenish customs, custom for deaths, fetish dancing in public streets, &c.), which prevents the progress of the inhabitants in civilization. If the educated natives do really know what civilization and colonization are, they should help the authorities to root up heathenish and foolish customs, the only canker which destroys the promising tree.\n\nThere are certain fetish men and women at Accra whose constant duty from time to time, and up to the present date, is to peep into every individual house and amongst every individual family for women who departed this life in the struggle of childbirth. As soon as these fetish men see or hear of the event they lose no time, but hasten into the house at night about twelve o\'clock and demand the remains, and carry them into an open field, and there cast the body, without burying it, for the wild beasts to eat. Is not such a custom an atrocious thing? Is it not a crime that deserves heavy punishment? After these wretched and barbarous fetish men and women have mercilessly performed this so-called duty, they call on the relatives of the deceased for all the property which pertained to her, whatever it may be, and convey it to the house of the head fetish man. Having done so, the fetish men and women bring fetish water, as they call it, in a wooden bowl, with certain kind of leaves, into the house of the deceased woman, and sprinkle the household and the bereaved husband, and the priest pronounces them ""unclean."" By this word ""unclean"" the whole of Accra consider this individual family as people who are accursed, for a space of three successive weeks. During these weeks the accursed families, as well as the husband of the deceased woman, are not allowed to go out; neither are they allowed to salute anyone; they do not go into any house, neither do any of their kinsmen or kinswomen go to them.

C. Phillips, Native Missionary at Ode Ondo, in the Ijesha country, gave, in a very interesting sermon preached at the Breadfruit Church, the following important information: That in consequence both of the constant teachings of missionaries and of the treaty recently concluded by our Government with Ondo, public opinion there has greatly improved in regard to immolations of human beings at the funerals of the great and opulent to which the Ondos have been particularly very much addicted; that he had no reason to doubt the sincerity of their promise to give them up altogether; that even before the arrival of Consul Hewett there in November, 1880, and the formation of the treaty, some persons of consequence and influence might have been heard charging their friends never to practice human immolations at their death; and that the king of Ondo has exercised considerable self-denial and magnanimity in consenting to their abolition as they had been a very rich source of revenue to him, since for every person thus slain a slave was to be given him.\n\nThere are, however, two periodical public and central human sacrifices for the whole country, which Ondos are very reluctant and much afraid to give up. One of them is offered sometime between July and August to Esu, the Devil, the author of all ills, whose anger and cruelty they dread, and whom they would conciliate. Another is offered sometime between September and October, as we afterwards learnt, to Oramafe, the divinity at Ife, the cradle of the human family, after the Yoruba tradition, who gives to the earth its fatness. This is a thanksgiving offering for the blessing of harvest which he gives. Yam being amongst Yorubas, and especially among Ijeshas, the staple food, the sacrifice and offering is made during the yam harvest, and the divinity to whom it is presented is represented in the shape of a yam, made of brass. Some chiefs have counselled their abolition, but the priests, Babalawos, to whom this service is a source of gain and influence, are very actively opposed to it, and would not sanction it. The power of the priesthood in heathendom here is by no means to be despised. The people are certainly priest-ridden. Some chiefs, who have shown themselves amenable to good influences, have counselled the abolition of those sacrifices, and some concessions have been made to missionary teaching, treaty stipulations, and the desire of those chiefs by the employment now only of criminals condemned to death for crimes of which they have been guilty for this service.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1882#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.575, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethnology of the Congo', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A meeting of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland was held recently, when Mr. H. H. Johnston read a paper ""On the Ethnology of the Congo and South-western Africa."" Mr. Johnston stated that the coast of Africa, between the Senegal and Mossamedes, afforded the best ground for studying the negro and collateral races. Round about Mossamedes there were found Bushmen and Hottentots, and the latter had amalgamated to some extent with native tribes. They were distinguished by the clicks in their tongue, the Bushmen perhaps the most archaic, having eight, the Hottentots four, and the others two. When the Hottentots invaded the Mossamedes district great consternation was caused among the native tribes; but they had settled down quietly, and they suffered terribly from disease in the rainy seasons. Outside their own territory it was not probable that they would give much trouble. In most of the tribes the women had to do all the hard work, and were in consequence stronger and more muscular than the men. In one instance the women had it all their own way, and they alone had the privilege of anointing their bodies, but as the unguents they used were rancid butter and disagreeably-smelling herbs, their presence to strangers was made insupportable. One remarkable fact was that there was no great despotic chief ruling vast numbers of these people, each petty chief owning sway only over a comparatively small population. The Bantu tribes, who inhabited the Congo district, might be divided roughly into two classes, one of a low type, living next the coast, and one very much higher, inhabiting the parts in the upper reaches round Stanley Pool. The former were small and ill-made, and the latter well-built and courteous in their demeanour. The villages between Vivi and Stanley Pool had a very prosperous appearance. Here also the women did all the trading, haggling over their wares with extreme vigour, while the men were the ornamental part of the race. When any disputes arose between buyer and seller, they were referred to the market arbitrator, who invariably fined both parties so heavily that his interference was very seldom invoked. Among the Inkimbi there were some curious superstitions and ceremonies. If any person died, some one who was supposed to have caused it was compelled to drink a decoction of poisonous herbs with the view of making him vomit the evil spirit within him which had caused the mischief. They had also a kind of freemasonry among the males with certain passwords and signs. The initiation into this select body consisted of three stages. During the novitiate, which lasted six months, was taught the sacred language, which no woman was ever allowed to learn, and which no stranger had yet been able to investigate. It was probably some original archaic form of the Bantu tongue preserved among the select class, just as in other countries, Sanskrit, old Slavonic and Latin were used. Among several tribes phallic worship prevailed very largely. When a great chief died, four slaves were generally put to death, so that their spirits might go to wait upon their master, and in the burying place of any one of any consequence there were always placed a quantity of cloth, plates, knives, &c., so that the individuals might be prepared to commence life anew. The people generally were very superstitious, and had but a vague and shadowy idea of another life.

Some of the children had their heads shaved, and their bare polls were smeared like their faces, breasts, and arms. The female Fantee is not sparing of her charms. This was a custom held in honour of a man who had died several months ago, leaving much property to his relatives. In gratitude for this, they had worn mourning for the deceased for a long time, and now they appeared in chalk and white raiment as a formal sign that the period of mourning was at an end. Part of this ceremony consisted in carrying a live child in a coffin. After all this, they went down to the beach and bathed. Abstinence from bathing on alternate days is one of the mourning customs here, and the women now bathed to show that the time of abstinence was over. It may sound heartless to find food for amusement in the funeral customs of people, but a man cannot be expected to feel more affected than the mourners themselves, and many of the girls who parade the streets in procession, with much howling and clapping their hands, break into a smile if they catch the eye of a white man as they pass.

Their heads were, of course, hanging downwards. The men were there left to die. The traders, as they proceeded along, were unwilling witnesses of a frightful sacrificial execution. They saw a number of natives in a group, and went to the spot to see what was taking place. To their horror they saw a native tied by the feet and neck. The rope to the neck was thrown over a tree in one direction, and the rope attached to the feet was tied to a tree in the opposite direction. The ropes were then drawn tightly, and when the body was distended to its utmost length, another native with a hatchet struck the neck, and severed the head from the body.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.576, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Belgium and the New Congo State', 'section_title': '', 'content': '### WEST AFRICAN MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.\n\nA correspondent writes: In accordance with your request I send you the following explanations of some of the native manners and customs.\n\n1. **Marriage Ceremonies.**—The presentation of kola nuts in marriage signifies a wish that the couple may be united in one, even as the two divisions of the nut are united.

Egypt, and not India, is the common cradle of all we have in common, east, west, north, and south, all round the world. The languages, beliefs, rites, laws and customs went out to India, but did not return thence by means of the apocryphal Aryan migrations. The Indian affinity with our European folk-lore and fairyology is neither first nor final, \'tis but the affinity of a collateral relationship. Egypt supplied the parent source, the inventive mind, the propagating migratory power. In Egypt alone we shall find the roots of the vast tree, whose boughs and branches have extended to a worldwide reach.""\n\nA critic observes, ""The author makes Africa the birth-place of us all. In the far off past a Central African race got on to the Nile in its upper course, and gradually descended towards the Delta, halting in Æthiopia, but finding it impossible to stop on account of the pressure of population behind. Thus the Central Africans became Æthiopians, and the Æthiopians became Egyptians ... all the ends of the earth became peopled from Africa!!!""

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure.

The Christian churches organized their own concerts, schools were drawn into the concert rage - prize-giving days, visit of the district officer, Queen Victoria's birthday, etc. The black missionaries refused to be outdone - the Reverend Samuel Ajayi Crowther was a famous example; a black prelate prominent in the patronage and encouragement of this form of the arts, while the Reverend James Johnson turned the famous Breadfruit Church in Lagos into a springboard for theatrical performances. 1 $^{6}$ The Brazilian returnees added an exotic yet familiar flavour, their music finding a ready echo in the traditional melodies of the west coast and the Congo whose urban suppression had not occurred long enough for such melodies to be totally forgotten.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

African dance, art, music and traditional religious systems held their own and such borrowings and adaptations as were made by Africans were not only selective but also, to borrow M. J.

Despite the break imposed by the practice of slavery, African culture survived and, what is more, created a new culture."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': 'Literary culture in the Western Sudan', 'content': ""We have already commented on some devices employed by the 'autoch› thones' against the mechanisms of cultural negation employed by European colonialism; the Islamic culture, in the proselytizing polity of the Dyula, was to encounter the same resistance.

The result was that in some aspects of the life of a colony such as the purely secular the two systems could work hand in hand, while in some others they would work independently and, sometimes, at cross purposes.\nOne other social impact of foreign rule which was noticeable quite early in the colonial period was the general depression of the status of Africans. Colonialism superimposed on the pre-existing class structure of the continent at least an extra layer of leaders and pacesetters. In East Africa where it encouraged Asian immigration, colonialism in fact superimposed two classes. In each colony Europeans had the monopoly of political, economic and educational power, except in East Africa where a fraction of the economic power fell into the hands of Asians. In this situation the Africans became the underprivileged and looked up to the Europeans, and at times to the Asians, for leadership and example.\nThis structure of social relationship was shored up with a bogus racial theory which sought to arrange the different branches of the human family in a hierarchical order of civilization with the Africans (the Negroes) occupying the bottom of the ladder while the Europeans (whites) occupied the top. In Southern Africa, in particular, where white settlers found themselves locked in conflict with numerically superior Bantu peoples, the racial theory was especially stringent, with the authority of the Holy Bible being wrongly used to reinforce the presumed social implications of pseudo-Darwinism. For the Negroes in particular the theory postulated a degree of cultural barrenness which made it necessary and possible to explain their history and social evolution in terms of the Hamitic impact.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The impact of Africa', 'content': 'Where they could - and where they had no other recourse - Africans and Afro-Americans adjusted to the conditions in which they found them› selves. In a milieu of cultural symbiosis, Africans contributed almost as much to the rest of the society as they accepted from it. Of course, the more they needed and the less they found, the more they became creative as the patois speech pattern of the previously French eastern Caribbean islands and the papiamento of the previously Dutch Antilles reveal. Cre› ativity became especially necessary where a small number of Europeans lived among a large number of Africans as was the case in many colonies of exploitation such as Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Saint-Domingue. Where the European population failed to comprise a critical mass, the Africans had to build a society from a diverse collectivity of individuals who had little more in common than their skin colour and their servility. The adoption of their customs and behaviour by the non-African sector indicated the measure of their success.\nAfricans did not always conform to the society into which they were thrust. For centuries marronage, or the flight from the slave system, existed as an integral aspect of slavery.$^{53}$ In Brazil, the north-east witnessed the establishment of the quilombo of Palmares which lasted almost a century and which was eliminated only with the largest military force ever mounted in the Americas by the Portuguese and Brazilians. Maroon towns existed for equally long periods in Esmeraldas in Ecuador and in parts of the Blue Mountains and the Cockpit Country of Jamaica. Marronage manifested not only the wish to be free, it was an eloquent and visible condemnation of the system of slavery by Africans.\nBy the time African slavery was eliminated in the Americas, the position of the African sector had worsened dramatically from what it had been a century before. The political and economic reconstruction that followed the Civil War in the USA accompanied a movement of legal discrimination and social and economic exclusion of the non-white sector, characterized by segregated institutions, lynchings, and overtly racist societies and organ› izations, which combined until the middle of the twentieth century.$^{54}$ The general conditions experienced by black Americans then compared with those prevailing today in a more extreme way in South Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'The persistence and transformation of African cultural values in Latin America and the Caribbean', 'content': ""The distribution of each group by social category, regardless of other indicators such as schooling, should then be studied, and this will provide a basis for analysing changes in the position of the population of African origin. This approach was used by Octavio Ianni and Fernando Henrique Cardoso$^{69}$ to study the process by which former slaves entered the free labour market and, subsequently, their integration into the urban economy.\nThis type of analysis makes it possible to evaluate the extent to which the population of African origin is integrated in the economic systems and societies of South America. However, it leaves on one side the continuing prestige of African cultural values in the New World, although of course one may hold the view that this can only be measured by using a racial criterion or that it is not an important variable.\nHere there are two conflicting schools of thought. The position taken by M. J. Herskovits$^{70}$ regarding the 'reinterpretation' of African culture as reflected in continuing cultural elements, provoked the black North American sociologist, E. Franklin Frazier$^{7}$ ' to draw attention to the central problem of integration in society as a whole. As Frazier saw it, Herskovits' theory could lead to the conclusion that the persistence of African cultural values might be regarded as evidence supporting the racialist argument that blacks cannot be assimilated. In the United States, on account of various factors including the work of the Protestant churches, the former slaves lost most of their traditional African cultural values and became part of the Anglo-Saxon cultural world.\nThe parallel between North America and South America and the Caribbean in terms of the African presence and particularly of African cultural values is not conclusive, for the situations were very different in view of the different ways in which the former slaves became 'integrated' in those regions, even from one country to another.\nFrom the cultural standpoint, whereas in the United States conversion to the Protestant religion led to the forsaking of cultural traditions and to the emergence of a new outlook, in Latin America and the Caribbean African cultural values persisted to varying degrees or underwent a process of transformation.\nMethodologically, two forms of presence should be distinguished: the cultural presence of Africa and the Negro presence in the physical sense.

African sailors were also common by this time in the merchant service, though more so in Portugal than in France or Britain. Another significant, if smaller, group was made up of students, who began to arrive in Europe in significant numbers by the middle of the eighteenth century and, in increasing numbers, throughout the nineteenth century. In an era in which commercial contact between Europe and Africa was increasing, it was an obvious advantage to African traders to be literate in a Western language and to have some acquaintance with European accounting practices. Many of these students therefore came to Europe through the good offices of European slave-traders operating in Africa and studied under their care in the principal slave-trade ports like Liverpool or Nantes.\nStill another peculiarity of the African communities in Europe was the fact that they were overwhelmingly male. This fact had two important implications. The African community was not self-sustaining. It had to be, and was, constantly replenished from overseas. This is not to say that the Africans had no sexual relations with European women, but the products of these relationships tended to be culturally European rather than African. After a few generations, the African physical appearance tended to disappear into the general European genetic pool.\nSome Africans also found their way into Eastern Europe, in spite of a more attenuated maritime contact with tropical Africa itself. There, the main line of entry was by way of the Ottoman slave trade, which was not mainly a trade in North Africans, but included sub-Saharan Africans drawn across the Sahara to Ottoman-associated ports like Tripoli, or brought north down the Nile from what is now the southern Sudan.$^{32}$ In a few instances, small pockets of African culture persisted in parts of the Ottoman empire into the twentieth century, such as a small Hausa-speaking com› munity in what is now Yugoslavia.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 178, 'article_title': 'NATAL.', 'full_section_title': 'NATAL.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1863#article-11', 'issue_date': '23_06_1863', 'content': 'By the Cape Mail we have news from Natal to the 3rd April.

Coffee, Cotton, and all other products, look most promising, and a generally good yield is anticipated. Cotton, Flax, and other textile fabrics, are occupying attention in the colony. The average yield of Sea Island cotton will, it is said, be about 400lbs. of ginned cotton per acre. It is also now affirmed that cotton planting and sugar planting may be carried on successfully together, because at the time when labour is most wanted in the cotton fields it is least needed in the cane fields. Several patches of cotton, of a few acres each, are to be seen this year. But unless the Kafirs take to labour in the cotton fields, the labour question will be the great difficulty.

Miss Eunice Williams having been under the care of Mr. and Mrs. F. FitzGerald, who reside there, and having thus become known to, and intimate with their friends, the news of her approaching marriage with Mr. Taylor had spread throughout the district. The fact that the wedding was to take place at St. Mary\'s Cray Church on the 14th June, and that the wedding breakfast would be given at Mr. F. FitzGerald\'s, having become generally known, a deep feeling of interest in the approaching ceremony seems to have pervaded a large portion of the neighbouring community. The coming event became a general topic of conversation, and the intended bride, even in walking through the street of the village, had to listen to the intelligence of her being the young lady whose time of maiden victory was near at hand. As the appointed day approached, and the necessary preparations for the ceremony and festivities became noised abroad, the interest in the event increased around the centre of the circle of attraction. Friends of the family, and of the bride who resided with them, became eager to obtain a view of the wedding dresses, the superb bridal cake, and other objects which have peculiar attractions in the eyes of the fairer portion of creation; and the affectionate sympathy of friends was shown by appropriate contributions of the choicest flowers they possessed, and the offer for use of whatever they could furnish to augment the resources of the establishment. In the variable climate of England, the weather is always cause of solicitude, and the state of barometer and thermometer was eagerly watched, amid the general expression of hope that the sun would shine forth in unclouded beauty. These hopes were happily realized. The auspicious day had arrived, and it proved to be all that could be desired by those who have faith in the time-honoured prognostication, ""Happy is the bride that the sun shines upon."" The morning was as bright, the day throughout as fair, as the most flattering of soothsayers could have predicted. The fine peal of bells at the village church gave early notice that public expectation was not to be disappointed; and as soon as nine o\'clock, the approaches to the edifice were thronged by an eager multitude, who watched with interest the placing of the matting over which the bride was to walk from her carriage through the long churchyard, and the crimson cloth which extended from the portals of the building to the communion table. As many of the wedding guests, all English friends of the bride, were to come from London, the authorities of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway had kindly placed at their disposal a saloon carriage for their conveyance, and allowed an otherwise through train to stop at St. Mary\'s Cray Station. The bridal carriages were there in waiting to receive them, and convey them direct to the church, which they reached at eleven o\'clock, to the great gratification of the on-lookers, whose expectation was further stimulated by the speedy arrival of the carriage containing the bridegroom and his best man, Julius Heck, Esq., a young English gentleman, whose extremely fair, bright complexion contrasted strongly with his own. The four young bridesmaids soon appeared: Miss Lottie Heck, Miss Ellen Cole (of Sierra Leone), Miss Welch (daughter of the esteemed Vicar), and Miss FitzGerald, in ethereal dresses, two of pink, and two of azure blue. Following these were four young female domestics, the attendants of the day, all neatly, prettily, and uniformly dressed, bearing baskets with flowers, to strew the path of the bride. Expectation was now at fever-height. The bells were ringing out their merry peal; hundreds of faces, all beaming with good wishes, shone on the bride as, accompanied by Mr. FitzGerald in her carriage, she descended the village street. There was but one expression of feeling as, stepping from the vehicle, she proceeded, leaning on the arm of Mr. FitzGerald, through the churchyard and up the aisle to the centre of the church, where the happy, expectant bridegroom was awaiting her, and that expression was ""admiration"" of her beautiful dress and faultless bearing, and the peculiar elegance of the entire bridal train, thus rewarding the anxious and loving care of Mrs. FitzGerald. The organ pealed forth its notes of welcome, the bride took her station beside the bridegroom, and the three surpliced clergymen who were to officiate—the Rev. Andrew Welch, Vicar of St. Mary\'s Cray, assisted by the Rev. Henry Johnson, of Sierra Leone (a fellow-townsman of the bride and bridegroom, and, like them, a native of Africa), with the Rev. Professor Hechler (formerly in Lagos, and lately tutor to the grandson of the Emperor of Germany)—were immediately at their post. Mr. FitzGerald gave away the bride. The Vicar conducted the most important portion of the service, receiving the appointed responses of the bride and bridegroom, superintending the placing of the ring on the bride\'s finger, and pronouncing them to be man and wife. The bridal party then advanced to the communion rails, where the nuptial benediction was pronounced by the Vicar, and the concluding portion of the service read by his reverend brethren. Being a choral service, the bridal hymn was sung by young fresh voices; the happy pair received the congratulations of their numerous friends, and as they marched down the church aisle, and through the assembled crowd outside, their path was strewn with flowers by many willing hands. It was calculated there were at least 1,500 persons in the church and churchyard. A photograph from Mr. Harman, of Bromley, was waiting at Richboro\' Lodge to photograph the wedding group before breakfast, which followed in due course; and, all accustomed wedding formalities being fulfilled, the newly-married pair took their departure at three p.m. for Brighton, *en route* for Paris; bells still pealing merrily, and the carriage, with the grouping guests making their farewell greetings, being photographed at the final moment. We may add, that never did bride and bridegroom receive more sincere congratulations than those offered to Mr. and Mrs. W. R. Taylor. The demeanour of the bride had been so uniformly winning, her amiability so natural, that all her English acquaintances, whether schoolfellows or those with whom she associated during the school vacations, became her friends—some most warm and loving ones; and the result was an assemblage of English ladies and gentlemen to do her honour, that gratified the heart of the Editor of the *African Times*, whose efforts have for many years been directed to raise the status of Africans in European society, by stimulating them to make themselves worthy of it. The bonds of affection that united the bride with so many of the wedding guests, placed all on the same footing within their magic circle, and a social triumph for Africa was thus secured which will not soon be forgotten.'}, {'id': 3182, 'article_title': 'Marriage', 'full_section_title': 'Marriage', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1876#article-23', 'issue_date': '01_08_1876', 'content': ""**MARRIAGE.**\n\n**COOPER—WILES.**—Married, on the evening of the 31st of May last past, at the large and commodious dwelling house of the bride's father, in Ashmun-street, by the Rev.

The very atmosphere was electric with the most wonderful schemes—religious, philanthropic, and commercial—for the exclusive benefit of the negro. From platform and pulpit rose a clamour of voices, in which was heard the popular watchwords of the day—civilisation, progress, the good of the negro, legitimate commerce, conversion of the heathen, and other high-sounding phrases, all having relation to the good things to be done for the African. The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation. They never heard now of the trader who went to Africa with the merely selfish object of making his fortune. Each and all became pioneers of civilisation, thinking only of the native first and self afterwards. They spoke as if the good to the native had been enormous, and that their intercourse with him had been a benefit and blessing. They pointed with pride to their sacrifices in the suppression of the slave trade, to their West Coast settlements as centres of secular light and leading; to their missionary stations as stars twinkling in the night of heathendom; to the returns of their trade with every entrance to the heart of Africa, as showing the spread of their beneficial influence. They saw that the work of other nations had been pernicious in the extreme, that they had been brutal in their dealings with native races, and had thought only of their own sordid interests and national aggrandisement—all in marked contrast to their aims and methods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'A JEWISH WEDDING IN MOROCCO.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A correspondent of the Jewish Chronicle, who has recently been travelling in Tangier, sends to that paper a description of a wedding at which he was present: ""At about ten o\'clock the lady friends assembled at the house of the bride\'s father. They were arrayed in characteristic gala dress. The bride, who wore a scarlet dress embroidered with gold, sat at the top of the room; her face was thickly powdered, whilst her fingers and nails were stained with \'henna;\' with this dye curious devices were painted on her hands, others having the same ornamentation. Among her rings I perceived the never-failing charm, carved in the shape of a hand, and worn by all Jewesses of Tangier to guard off the Evil Eye. On either side of the house door an open hand had been painted in red, also for the same purpose. In one corner of the room four Moorish musicians sat cross-legged, chanting Arabic songs of love in a peculiarly droll manner, the instrumental accompaniment consisting of a guitar, violin, and tambourine. The young unmarried ladies wore European dresses made in Spanish style. The daughters of Israel in Morocco, and especially in the northern parts, are very beautiful, and their complexion much fairer than one would expect. Many of them are well educated. Having chatted until five P.M., the ladies proceeded to another apartment to partake of green tea and sweets. At six the ladies made way for the gentlemen—the bridegroom being absent, according to custom, from the bride\'s house. The festivities were continued until eight, and the bride was then covered with the marriage veil, her head being surmounted by a white silk head-dress adorned with flowers. Her eyes were closed by her mother—custom observed, as a fair informant explained to me, \'por verguenza,\' otherwise the bride might feel bashful at meeting the gaze of the assembled company. After embracing her father, she was conducted to a spacious palanquin, and in this was carried, with her mother and sister, to her future home, where her intended husband awaited her. On arrival she was led to a seat on a daïs prepared in the apartment in which the ceremony was to be solemnised, her mother sitting on one side of her and the bridegroom\'s mother on the other. Here she remained for some time until the company gradually dispersed. She was then confided to the charge of her future mother-in-law, under whose care she remained until nine o\'clock the following morning, when the marriage was celebrated in the presence of about fifty friends. The bride again took her seat on the daïs, whilst the bridegroom, wearing a talith and phylacteries, his dress being European, even to the silk hat, stood at the foot under the overhanging canopy. Prayers were said by the officiating minister, and the customary glass broken by the bridegroom, after which congratulations were offered to the newly-wedded couple. At about eleven o\'clock P.M. the company dispersed. Next day the young husband went to render homage to his mother-in-law by kissing her hand, and a dance on the following Saturday night concluded the festivities.""', 'last_edit_date': '1881-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1881#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Genius of Native Africans; Their Contributions to the Centennial Exhibition', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Allow me space in your valuable columns to set aright an erroneous mistake. An editor informed me that a friend of his who visited the Centennial advised him that he saw the gold trinkets from the Gold Coast, but he was told that those trinkets were made by the white settlers on the Gold Coast. I beg to deny this assertion _in toto_. In the first place, there are no white settlers on the West Coast of Africa, beginning from ""St. Mary\'s Bathurst, Gambia,"" to ""St. Paul de Loanda."" The few Europeans and Americans on that Coast are either Government officials, missionaries, or merchants. The large assortment of gold trinkets that are in the main building at the Centennial are as follows: Gold ear-rings, gold drops, gold bracelets, of various designs; gold hair-combs, gold crosses, gold brooches, in shapes of butterflies and other designs; gold rings, with the twelve signs of the Zodiac and numerous other designs; gold beads, gold studs, gold links, gold chains, gold necklaces, gold guards, gold dust, and other gold trinkets too numerous to mention; and these gold trinkets were made by the native Africans, some of whom cannot speak a word of the English language. In style of workmanship these trinkets are unequalled by anything made by civilized craftsmen the world over. Certainly there is nothing in this line in the Centennial that may be placed beside them; and when it is considered that they were wrought with rude tools, that the artizans were native men, unskilled in civilized art; that they and their fathers from time immemorial have ever lived on the Gold Coast, that they are the manufacturers of the largest assortment of trinkets in the Centennial,—then it seems to me that these men,—the ""Ashantees,"" the ""Accras,"" the ""Fantees,"" the ""Denkras,"" the ""Wassaws,"" the ""Assins,"" &c.,—should not be deprived of the meed of praise which belongs to them, but should receive the just reward for their great genius and their native art. I therefore, as an African, of which I am proud, having been born, bred and educated on that Coast, feel called upon to make this explanation. On several occasions while visiting the Centennial, I spent some time in explaining to the ladies and gentlemen who crowded around me that these trinkets were made by the native Africans, and I took great pains to impress upon their minds the capability and ingenuity of the native Africans. I would like very much that the words West Africa should be placed under the words Gold Coast, for many persons will think that the Gold Coast is in Australia or California, and thus deprive Africa of her just merits. Give to all nations, tribes, and people what is due to them.

Although not the first among European nations to plant colonies beyond Europe, England had acquired a more extensive dominion of colonies and dependencies than any other nation in the world. She undertook the colonisation of West Africa, not by any means for renown or direct commercial advantage, but entirely with the magnanimous and philanthropic object of the salvation of the sons of Africa, both temporally and spiritually. The Colonies on the West Coast of Africa were annexed to Great Britain, first, for the suppression of that abominable traffic, the slave trade, and, secondly, for the free propagation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The colonial dependencies of Great Britain on the West Coast of Africa, which formed a portion of the 7,500,000 square miles of the British Empire, included Sierra Leone or the West Africa Settlements, the River Gambia, the Gold Coast Colony and the Slave Coast—now Lagos Colony—a total area of some 40,000 square miles. The lecturer briefly described the geographical position and features of each settlement, and then gave an interesting account of the circumstances under which Sierra Leone, the oldest colony in West Africa, became a British settlement, an episode with which those who have studied history are generally familiar. This colony eventually became peopled, and a foundation was laid for the labours of the Church Missionary Society and other Christian bodies in the year 1791. In the year 1799 a few Englishmen established in London ""The Society for Mission to Africa and the East,"" up to which time the Church of England had done nothing to spread Christianity among the heathen. In 1812 this name was changed to ""The Church Missionary Society for Africa and the East."" The first missionaries were sent to West Africa, because it had ever been, and it was then, the chief theatre of the inhuman slave trade. The great difficulty was to get missionaries, owing to the fatality of the climate to Europeans, the trying difficulties and experiences of the work, and the prevalent but erroneous idea that all efforts to raise the blacks in the social scale must prove fruitless. Ultimately two German missionaries were prevailed upon to enter upon the great and good work, and others subsequently followed from England, and ever since had been from time to time reinforced. In the first month of 1814 the foundation stone of the first Christian Church in Africa was laid at Bassia, and the committee of the above-mentioned society, now co-operating with the British & Foreign Society, were deeply engaged in carrying out the plan of redeeming as many African children as possible from slavery and attaching them to the missionary settlements. Having gone through the early history of the Church on the West Coast of Africa, the lecturer proceeded to detail a few facts to prove the glorious results of the labours of the religious societies in co-operation with the foundation laid by the goodwill and philanthropic energies of many noble-hearted men, whose efforts and constant ambition were devoted to the abolition of slavery and the slave trade. Amongst many results were the most perfect freedom of the meanest subject; the existence, all over the coast line, of peace and tranquillity as set against the unending civil wars and riots that marked the period of slavery; the ecclesiastical establishment of the West African settlements, and the profuse circulation of the Bible throughout the Colonies.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.62, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

It may, perhaps, be reasonably held that the advance of civilisation will be more rapid than Sir George Goldie ventures to anticipate, and that some now living may see prosperous negro communities developing the rich soil of Central Africa, with their lives unshadowed by the horrors of bloodshed, slavery, and cruel superstition. It will be interesting in connexion with this subject to watch the outcome of Sir Alfred Moloney's proposal for the repatriation into his colony of Lagos of negroes from Brazil, as the success of this scheme would be a strong encouragement to the larger proposals to which Dr. Blyden has for many years devoted his talents—namely, the repatriation of the negroes from the United States. It is admitted by the Niger Company that they already have to depend largely in their territory on the services of their coloured officials, natives of the British Colonies, who have proved invaluable for treaty-making and diplomatic intercourse with the native chiefs, as well as for the development of new products in which the Company has apparently made rapid progress.\n\nSir George Goldie does not refer, however, in his article to two of the most important features in the policy of the Company.

The great future wealth of the interior plateaux will certainly lie in their mineral deposits, the riches of the West Coast region lie in its numerous and valuable vegetable products, of which the most striking are palm oil, and ground nuts, benniseed, shea butter, rubber, gums, spices, cotton, dyes, and valuable timbers, among which ebony occupies a prominent place. With regard to animal products, I might mention ivory and monkey skins. Whereas some of the great races of the interior speak languages which connect them with the Hamitic and Semitic families. The native inhabitants of the West Coast are all that there is of most typically Negro in character; yet I do not mean they are races of particularly low development; on the contrary, the typical Negro is a fine specimen of man, and is by no means as low in his mental state as the races of Polynesia and America. I may cite the Kru tribes of that portion of West Africa which is known as Liberia, a country inhabited by an industrious, energetic, hardworking, stalwart population of free men. An element of heterogeneous ex-slave settlers among the tribes of the coast may be found in some parts of the Colonies of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos. These people represent the Nemesis which invariably follows national crimes. We and our American children indulged to a greater extent than any other European nation in the African slave trade, and, as our wrong-doing was violent and exaggerated, so to a certain extent was the abrupt reparation which followed. Although I would not minimise the work done by our blockade on the West Coast, the abolition of the slave trade was more effectually brought about by the abolition of slavery in the United States of America. One result of our suppression of the slave trade in West Africa has not been altogether advantageous. I refer to the Slave Colonies established at Sierra Leone, and at Fernando Po and other points on the coast. It may be taken that the slaves exported from any district are the least worthy people in it, and the result is that a large proportion of this population is descended from the sweepings of West Africa, and has not yet passed through sufficient generations to eliminate the ancestral badness of its progenitors. So, although here and there a negro has shown what the race can attain to under favourable circumstances, still the bulk of the ""S\'a Leone"" people who are scattered up and down the coast are of an undesirable character, and the cause of indiscriminating blame on the part of superficial observers which is most unjustly laid on the shoulders of the entire population of West Africa; whereas many of these races are superior in intelligence, enterprise, and integrity to any of our negro fellow-subjects in South Africa or the West Indies. What admirable recruits to civilised society can be obtained from many of these people may be instanced by such men as Bishop Crowther, Archdeacons Johnson and Crowther, Samuel Lewis, and other divines and lawyers and officials in West Africa, who are on a par with well-educated white men, and in some cases superior in intelligence and acquirements to the whites with whom they come in contact. It is absurd, however, to regard the Negro race, as a whole, on the same average level as the European—they are far below us. Take them in their native wilds, and they are what we were before Julius Caesar landed in this country; indeed, in many cases they are not 2,000 years behind us, but 10,000. They are in the condition of some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and Gaul, and Spain, whose history we can dimly spell out from their implements and scattered remains, who were undoubtedly cannibals and probably naked, and leading a brutish life. Yet we can in a few years drag them from the condition that prevailed 2,000 years before Christ into the year of grace 1889. We can take a cannibal from the Upper Cross River, and transport him to the centres of civilisation in England or America, where everything represents the utmost result of our present development; but what will be usually the result both with the individual and the race? The savage mind will be unable to grasp and assimilate one-third of the wonders presented to his consideration, and will probably even suffer from the shock. We cannot expect the negroes of West Africa to become all at once intelligent, self-governing people. For many years the white races must be their guardians and educators, and we must educate the negro by force if necessary, leaving him to understand us afterwards, when we have raised him to a condition to do so. This, then, is our mission in West Africa: to instruct the natives that idleness is the eighth deadly sin; next, to so instruct the native as to the existence of the resources of this country; and, lastly, to educate him in the principles of civilised society, and so assimilate his views with our own that he and we may be bound together with the ties of commerce and Empire.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.617, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The trading operations of Europeans in West Africa are carried on after the following manner: The trader selects a site suitable—generally by the side of a river or creek, or along the seashore—and comes to terms with the owner of the soil or the native chief of the district for the leasing of the land, the natives retaining a dislike to alienating any part of their country.

The houses are well built, well ventilated, and comfortably furnished, and have all the appearance of a bright, pleasant home.

The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.62, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'With the present class of trader little fault can be found.

It also discusses the introduction of American plant varieties like maize, cassava, and sweet potatoes into African agriculture, suggesting potential impacts on the environmental landscape through foreign species. However, it does not delve into the broader scientific interest or specific environmental impacts of these introductions. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize the scientific interest in Africa's rich biodiversity, exemplified by Dr. Ori's extensive research and collection of rare specimens during his seven-year expedition in Central Africa. They also note the presence of valuable plant species such as black pepper and cloves in West Africa, highlighting their potential for commercial export. While these articles focus on the documentation and economic potential of native species, they do not address the environmental impact of introducing foreign species or practices.

Moreover in some cases American plants had become so integrated that they were no longer regarded as foreign imports. Thus in the Kongo region we have for the lower Zaire river the first systematic inventory of a Central African flora (Tuckey expedition, 1818), which confirms the widespread use of the American varieties.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.615, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""with sections on Latin America and the Caribbean by ALBUQUERQUE MOUR˜O Substantial African expatriate communities or influences have affected such diverse regions of the world as classical Greece and Rome; Portugal (since the fifteenth century); the Caribbean; the United States (since the seven› teenth century); Britain (since the eighteenth century); Canada (particularly after the American War of Independence); Brazil (particularly since the eighteenth century); Saudi Arabia; India; and, occasionally, Turkey.

Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

Repatri› ation during the nineteenth century offered few material rewards for Europeans or non-Europeans. But by 1900, the divergence between Africa and the Americas had become too great. Persons of African descent became caught up in the self-consciousness of the age which produced the type of xenophobic nationalism that all but destroyed the appeal of Africa. More› over, the interest in Africa after the end of the slave trade grew from national lusts for power and wealth - and Afro-Americans lacked both political power and the wealth needed to stimulate their own interest, or influence those who were partitioning Africa into colonial spheres. The Afro-American view became focused more on the new developments within their hemisphere. Internal and inter-regional migrations and the quest to establish the good life against new deleterious challenges absorbed their attention. The African connection faded, but did not die. The return-toAfrica movement found individual promoters who could occasionally infuse the movement with new appeal.

We may add that Dr. Ori's medical knowledge, acquired during a long course of study at the University of Pisa, and his acquaintance with various African dialects, were of great advantage to him in his intercourse with the natives, whom he appears to have had the good fortune to have conciliated in a very remarkable manner. — *African Repository (May).*""}, {'id': 5252, 'article_title': ""HERR ROGOZINSKI'S WEST AFRICAN EXPEDITION."", 'full_section_title': ""HERR ROGOZINSKI'S WEST AFRICAN EXPEDITION."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_11_1885#article-20', 'issue_date': '02_11_1885', 'content': ""## HERR ROGOZINSKI'S WEST AFRICAN EXPEDITION.""}]","[{'document_title': 'AFRICAN PROSPECTS', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Between the north and the south of Africa spread about 7,000,000 square miles of almost unknown land.

England, France, Portugal, Germany, and Italy are attempting to obtain titles to the country. England has made annexation of the coast lying adjacent to her colony of Sierra Leone; France is forcing her way on the Senegal and toward the head-waters of the Niger; she threatens to annex the coast from the Gaboon to the Congo, some 250 miles, and is running her lines on the Upper Congo. Her Chamber of Deputies has granted the De Brazza mission, by a vote of 449 to 3, a credit of a million and a quarter of francs. The Portuguese Government has appointed explorers and examined the Congo country, and assumes to exercise control over all the territory at the mouth of the Congo. The German Reichstag has increased its annual appropriation for the exploration of Africa. Italy has despatched a party to Abyssinia for geographical and mercantile purposes. She has also concluded treaties which promise to make Assab a centre of commerce. The Sultan of Morocco has authorized Spain to take possession of Santa Cruz del Mar, and the Sultan of Zanzibar has purchased six superior steamers to constitute a regular coast service, in the interest of commerce and for the suppression of the slave-trade. The International African Association, which owes its origin to the philanthropic initiative of Leopold II., King of the Belgians, has received large subscriptions and pushed forward exploring expeditions to start and equip the line of hospitable and scientific stations which are to bound the East and West Coast, and form a civilizing girdle around Central Africa. And the results following the explorations of Livingstone and Stanley and De Brazza are attracting the attention of the civilized world. What was a \'Dark Continent,\' by the indomitable energy of these explorers, seems likely to prove the richest quarter of the globe. Not only does the land produce, with slight persuasion of tillage, admirable crops of cotton and coffee, but the soil is rich in diamonds on its southern coast, and in iron on its northern. Captain Burton has asserted that he knows nothing to equal the prodigious wealth of the land, even in California, or in the Brazils. \'Gold dust is panned by native women from the sands of the sea shore.

He stated that the continent of Africa had an area of nearly a quarter of the entire land of the globe, and it had presented greater obstacles to human enterprise than any other part of the earth's surface. Notwithstanding the many explorations of scientific people and travellers, both recently and in ancient times, of which he quoted several instances, the vast interior of Africa still remained almost a terra incognita, with its natural wealth undeveloped, and its mineral treasures unexplored. It had a climate fully equal to any other part of the world, and capable of yielding tropical and subtropical productions to any extent. Still, it was a lost continent, banished, as it were, from commercial intercourse with the civilized parts of the world. The most considerable part of our commerce with North Central Africa was carried across the Great Desert of Sahara from the shores of the Mediterranean. Caravans now performed dangerous and tedious journeys of many months' duration from Morocco, Algiers, Tripoli, Tunis, and other ports to the kingdom of Soudan. Two thousand miles of sterile and mountainous country had to be traversed and hostile tribes encountered before the nearest market was reached. In spite of those difficulties, about three millions worth of British produce found its way annually from the North to Soudan, which kingdom had no less than twenty millions of inhabitants. The great importance of opening those regions to commerce could not for a moment be doubted, and Timbuctoo formed, he thought, the most favoured spot for such intercourse, situated as it was on the very edge of the Desert. His plan was to open a direct commercial highway from the mouth of the river Belta, in the neighbourhood of Capes Juby and Bogador, on the North-west Coast of Africa, opposite the Canary Islands, to the northern bend of the Niger, at Timbuctoo—a distance of about 800 miles. That would form the shortest route to the interior, and was within easy access of Europe and America, the mouth of the Belta being distant about 1,500 miles from England. The engineering difficulties were inconsiderable, since the physical formation of that part of the Desert of Sahara which had to be crossed favoured the project; a great tract of it, with an area of 126,000 square miles, and known as Eljuf, being a vast depression, considerably below the level of the Atlantic. It was bounded by fertile and populous regions, and inhabited by an industrious class of people, whose only commercial intercourse with Europe was carried on from Mogador. That depression was impregnated with salt, and it had, it was believed, formerly formed part of the bed of the sea. He contended that the climate, the geography, and the people were all favourable to the scheme, and if once the mouth of the Belta was cleared of sand, the waters of the Atlantic would fill their former bed; thus establishing a direct communication with North Central Africa within easy distance of our ports. Instead of a trade of three millions annually, it might be increased tenfold. The great continent of Africa would be opened to every wholesome influence, its vast resources would be developed, and the horrors of the slave-trade would no longer stain its history. He added that the proposed preliminary survey would enable them to obtain the necessary data to carry out the scheme, and that such survey would be comparatively inexpensive."", 'last_edit_date': '1875-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1875#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.614, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICA AND ITS TRADE POSSIBILITIES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'On Feb. 13, an interesting lecture, entitled ""A Naturalist on the Mountains of the Moon,"" was delivered at the Royal Institution, Liverpool, under the auspices of the Liverpool Geographical Society, by Mr. G. F. Scott Elliot. The lecture was followed with much interest as an exposition from an authority on the subject. Mr. Scott Elliot, by his recent visit to Ruwenzori, has afforded additional information about this magnificent range of mountains in Central Africa, and his treatment of the subject was graphic and most informing. The address was made the more interesting by a series of limelight views. After touching on the character of Africa generally, the lecturer proceeded to give an account of the mountain Ruwenzori, the various difficulties in climbing the primeval forest, its inhabitants, the bamboo zone, the peat mosses, and the various tribes round the mountain. The occurrence of recent volcanic craters, and the manner in which the cloud hangs over the mountain all day long, only disappearing about sunset, was fully illustrated by slides from photographs taken by the lecturer. The lecturer described his experiences. Leopards attacked his camp, and very nearly killed two of his porters. A woman was carried off by a lioness, and he vainly attempted to rescue her. Elephants were extremely abundant round the mountain. The Natives were usually friendly, though the difficulty of obtaining supplies was often considerable, and on one occasion three of his men were attacked by them, and one very severely wounded. His march to the South was one of extraordinary difficulty, as his caravan consisted only of fourteen men, and the people were in places extremely unfriendly, and on one occasion attacked his porters. The future value of these little-known regions was shown by him to depend mainly on three factors—First, the natural wild resources, as rubber, palm oil, minerals, and ivory; secondly, the prospects of plantation by Europeans; and thirdly, the health of Europeans. The country between 3,000 and 5,000 feet had been proved to be valuable for plantations of coffee and tobacco. It is only in Africa above 5,000 feet that there is any possibility of a real colony being formed. The lecturer expressed his opinion that with the knowledge we have now of these parts, the Masai Highlands certainly appear to be quite healthy enough for Europeans to live and bring up children; but that so far there is no sufficient inducement for colonisation at present. Then, turning to the needs of Great Britain at the present time, he suggested that the three main requisites at present were—first, that our imports of food and raw material should come from our own Colonies; secondly, new markets; and thirdly, an outlet for our capital and population, both of which were unnaturally locked up in Great Britain. These new countries were, according to him, exactly adapted to answer those three urgent necessities.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1896#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.629, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Capabilities of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Dear Brother in the cause of God and humanity,—The elevation of Africa is near my heart, and anything that promises to aid in rescuing her from her long and deep degradation meets a warm response in my heart.

We had buried our first-born there, a little boy of six years.\n\nBut poor Africa—what can be done for her? I rejoice in the success of Dr. Livingston, and of every other explorer and labourer in Africa; but much more need to be and can be done for her. 1. She needs missionaries and teachers, but these alone will not do the work needed. Accompanying them should be (2) farmers and mechanics, who can teach them civilization, for both must go together—civilization and Christianity: either without the other will fail; but both united will, with God's blessing, lift her up, and soon give her a place among the nations.\n\nShe has natural resources abundant. 1. The people are capable of being educated in the arts and sciences, in which they make rapid proficiency when an opportunity is provided. In managing business, mercantile or other, they manifest an ability equal to the whites. The richest men in Sierra Leone are negroes who were taken out of the slave ship. They make very efficient preachers, teachers, mechanics, farmers, &c., when instructed.\n\n2. The country is rich—very productive in many things needful for commerce and home consumption. Rice, Indian corn, and some smaller grains, suited to exportation, can be produced to any extent. Ginger, pepper, arrowroot, can be supplied to meet the wants of the world. Coffee and cotton of fine quality grow wild abundantly, and can be cultivated to any extent to supply Manchester and every cotton factory in Christendom. There only needs to do this to start it all along the Western Coast, and make a market for them, and the natives will go to producing them. They will work at what they can make the most money by. Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down. These things I have seen.\n\n3. And her minerals are rich and abundant. Gold and iron ore, the purest in the world, is very abundant in many parts.

It is indeed a compendium. It places before us in brief but luminous sketches, and with the aid of sixteen admirable maps and some seventy illustrations, all that is publicly known about Africa and its peoples—their specific peculiarities, character, manners, customs, and condition, physical and moral; with enumeration of its varied products, its trade and commerce. It is an admirable volume for all who desire general information respecting that great continent, into the dense darkness of which the light of civilization and Christianity has begun to penetrate, through the devoted exertions of missionaries and scientific explorers. Africa does not present us with any very pleasing pictures. They are all of barbarism, and for the most part barbarism of the lowest and most disgusting type, and yet such as awakes and impels to active exertion the warmest sympathies and desires of the Christian and philanthropist. Such books as this of Mr. Stanford\'s are particularly valuable in view of the extremely limited degree of information respecting Africa possessed even by the majority of well-educated people in England. So many active agencies are now at work in and for Africa that some more intimate knowledge of it must be desired; while yet the labour of wading through long and dreary books of African travel, with their sadly monotonous succession of pictures of sparsely-inhabited countries, and of ignorance, suffering, cruelty, and moral degradation everywhere, deters most people from seeking it in their pages. This ""Compendium"" meets such desires, and gets rid of such difficulties, offering as a prize to be gained by a few leisure hours\' reading all that it is essential well-educated people should know of this great continent. The degree of knowledge thus to be obtained may lead some whose attention has not hitherto been called in that direction to desires and sympathies with regard to that long-neglected quarter of the world, and its wretched populations. We therefore hail its appearance with great pleasure, and strongly recommend ""Stanford\'s Compendium—Africa"" to our readers.

Dr. Peters said that there were to be found in Africa a number of cool and healthy high plateaux, where the white man could not only live in comfort, but where he found all conditions for agricultural and pastoral pursuits just as in his old country. There were large and mighty rivers, whose alluvial tracts made the cultivation of all kinds of tropical vegetation possible. There were not wanting direct inducements for immigration such as were offered to the white man\'s imagination by the existence of precious metals and precious stones, and a later generation of colonists would be able to use throughout the entire continent, from north to south, iron for their immediate wants, and in many districts coal required by modern industry. A modern traveller had truly said that ""the greatest treasure of Africa consists in the inexhaustible labour force of its inhabitants."" The Native population, which was estimated at about 200 millions, only required to be organised by the whites in order to raise the natural wealth of the continent. A sound connexion of justice with proper severity towards the blacks was the correct principle of conduct to act upon. Africa required railways and highways in every part for the purpose of its economic development and civilisation. Rinderpest must be exterminated. The whole African question was the question of communication, and in the solution of this question lay the conditio sine qua non of the future of the Dark Continent.

There is a map in the Vatican, 300 years old, which gives the general physical relief and the river and lake systems of Africa with more or less accuracy; but the Arab geographers of a century before had described the mountain system, the great lakes, and the course of the Nile.

Neither Egyptian, Carthaginian, Persian, or Roman influence was allowed to establish itself on that continent. It would seem that no solution of the African problem was to come from alien sources. Africans were not to share the fate of other dark races who have come in contact with the European. Europe was diverted to the Western Hemisphere. The energies of that conquering race were spent in building up a home for themselves on this side. Africa followed in chains.\n\nThe Negro race was to be preserved for a special work in the future. It is probable that if foreign races had been allowed to enter their country they would have been destroyed. So they were brought over to be helpers in America and at the same time to be preserved. Slavery would seem to be a strange school in which to preserve a people; but God has a way of salting as well as purifying by fire. The Europeans found in America an aboriginal race unable to co-operate with them in the labours required for the construction of the new civilisation. The Indians would not work, and have suffered the consequences of that indisposition: they have passed away. To take their place as accessories in the work to be done, the African was brought, who could work and would work, and could endure the climatic conditions of a new southern country, which Europeans could not.

There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.599, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'African Reactions and Responses in West Africa, > The Yaa Asantewaa War', 'content': 'Like the Hut Tax rebellion of 1898, the Asante uprising of 1900 was precipitated by the attempts of the British to consolidate their rule by the deposition of some of the anti-British chiefs and the appointment to replace them of people who were not traditionally qualified, and by the imposition of a tax, in this case 4s per head, as a war indemnity in 1897. But the last straw that really precipitated action was the demand of the British governor, Arnold Hodgson, for the Golden Stool to be sent to him so that he could sit on it. The Golden Stool was the most sacred object of the Asante, which they considered as the embodiment of their soul and a symbol of their survival as a nation. That demand, therefore, could not but touch off an instantaneous rebellion of nearly all the principal states under the leadership of the Queen of Edweso, Nana Yaa Asantewaa (see Plate 6.2). 64 The Asante forces attacked the Governor and his party who had to seek refuge in the fort at Kumasi which the Asante then besieged. When the governor and his party escaped from the fort, the Asante fought several pitched battles with the British which lasted from April to November 1900 when Yaa Asantewaa was arrested and deported with other Asante generals to the Seychelles.\nSimilar revolts, pitched battles and guerrilla warfare raged in the Ivory Coast in response to the brutal methods including forced labour and high taxation used by that cruel Governor, Angoulvant, for the consolidation of French rule and the exploitation of the colony. This resistance by the Baule which broke out in 1908 continued until 1910 when, using the notorious search and destroy tactics, the French suppressed all remain› ing opposition with a brutality and wickedness unparalleled in the annals of African resistance (see Plate 6.5a).

It thus indicated the way in which the colonial situation, in providing education, was also providing the instrument of its own ultimate destruction. This was the basis of the antagonism that the colonial governments thereafter showed to the educated elite.\nIn 1872 the Asante sent an invasion force south to enforce what they regarded as their ancient right to Elmina and to revive their claims to Assin, Denkyira and Akyem. Having suppressed the Confederation and bought out the Dutch in 1872, the British decided to organize a response that would settle the Asante question once and for all.

In March 1856 a girl by the name of Nongqause, who was apparently under the religious tutelage of Mhlakaza, one of the advisers of Chief Sarili, prophesied that if the people killed all their cattle, destroyed their grain stores, and did not plant any crops that year, a whirlwind would come and blow the English oppressors into the sea. Besides, their heroes would rise from the dead and bring vast herds of cattle, huge quantities of grain, and even white men's manufactured goods. The message was obeyed by the Xhosa and the Thembu, and when the appointed day came nothing happened. Large numbers of people died of starvation on both sides of the Kei in 1857. Many of the Xhosa in the Ciskei streamed to the Cape Colony to seek employment among the whites as the only means of survival. The whole episode makes little sense and people have tried to look for hidden explanations without success. E. A. Walker was convinced that Moshoeshoe, who wanted to divert the British from the Orange Free State, where he confronted the Boers, engineered the Xhosa into their suicidal move so that in desperation they would rise against the British.$^{10}$ Some people think that it was a white man's plot meant of course to lead the Xhosa into selfdestruction. Little or no evidence exists to support either of these views. Perhaps Monica Wilson is right in interpreting the cattle-killing among the Xhosa just like the many, millenarian movements that have taken place in Europe, America and elsewhere in Africa. It was a movement, Wilson tells us, in which people sought to rid themselves of foreign domination and to recover their lands from the white settlers. 11 In the meantime Grey had taken advantage of the cattle-killing episode and its consequent weakening of the Xhosa and the Thembu. He confiscated large pieces of land from many of Sandile's chiefs whom he suspected of plotting an uprising against the British. The dispossessed chiefs and the people of Sarili were then all driven right across the Mbashe river so that an empty zone patrolled by the British police remained between the Kei and Mbashe rivers. He also encouraged white immigrants to settle on the confiscated lands.

He was also a mediator in conflicts between individuals and families. However, there was no shortage of subjects of tension. 59 In the Mossi kingdom of Wagadugu, slaves were made into eunuchs in sufficiently large numbers for it to be feasible to export them northward. In Asante, the quantity of human livestock obtained by the payment of tribute was so great that when the slave trade was abolished, the Asantehene stated that he could not feed the 20 000 captives whom he had on his hands, adding, 'unless I kill or sell them, they will grow strong and kill my people'. 60 It appears, however, that social relations between slaves and their owners were marked by less hostility in societies not having a central power structure. We are told that in the village of Pura, slaves were fed 'just like everyone else'. M. PŁre tells us that in the Lobi country, each submatriclan was divided into two groups: the true-born Weya, and the Dea, who were of captive origin. The latter category included people who had been adopted because they had been found at the door one morning, seeking refuge from famine or raiding. Both categories, however, were fully integrated within the social structure as sources of production and progeny. Accordingly, a slave lived in the same hut as his master, whom he addressed as 'father'; he was a member of the same kin group as the latter and was subject to the same rituals and taboos and engaged in the same work; his owner gave him a wife, he possessed a field, and was entitled to accumulate cowries to the point of buying his freedom or purchasing another man to replace him. What was required of him was that he remain in the same village as his master.$^{61}$ Here we see a clear indication of a deliberate policy of using slavery as a means of strengthening clan or territorial groups."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.601, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Massina and theTorodbe (Tukuloor)', 'section_title': 'The Muslim revolution in Massina: the reign of Seku Ahmadu (Shaykh Ahmad Lobbo) > The institutions of the dina', 'content': 'Justice in the first instance was everywhere dispensed by kâdis.

Several stories reported by A. H. Bâ and J. Daget tend to show that Seku Ahmadu did not always respect the relatively democratic institutions he had himself set up. Thus he set his face against the grand council\'s decision to abolish castes: The marabouts on the Grand Council, on the strength of the verse in the Ku\'ran: \'all believers are brothers\', had proposed the abolition of castes. Next day Seku Ahmadu had lizards, frogs, fish, chickens and mutton cooked all together, offered the dish to the marabouts and invited them to eat. \'What,\' they cried, \'would you have us eat such a mixture?\' \'Is a single one of all these meats forbidden by the Ku\'ran?\' retorted Seku Ahmadu. \'No, but although the Book may not forbid it, it disgusts us to eat lizard and frog and mix these meats with those we are used to eating.\' \'Likewise, although the Book does not forbid it, it disgusts me to mix together nobles and caste people and abolish the barrier by which we customarily separate them."" 8 Punishments were very severe.

Though this wave of millenarian movements had subsequently gradually died down in the sedentary parts of the Sudan, the Mahdists remained active in Därfür (see Fig. 4.1). Many assumed for themselves messianic prophecy and declared a djihäd against the 'infidel' British rule. The most important of them was fakt 'Abdullah al-Sihaynï, the leader of the Nyäla revolt of 1921.\nLike its predecessors, the Nyäla revolt aimed at the repudiation of the 'infidel' colonial rule and the restoration of the 'glorious' Mahdiyya in the Sudan. Beside this fundamental religious drive, the imposition of a centralized colonial administration, increase in the herd tax, and the overestimation of the $^{ l}$ushœr, were all other factors that provoked the people in Därfür to join the revolt. 23 Led by al-Sihaynï, a force of about five thousand warriors attacked Nyäla fort and the market on 26 September 1921. They gained control of the fort and set fire to a nearby building. Al-Sihaynï launched a second attack that could have driven the enemy into confusion had he not been seriously wounded. The colonial casualties in this round were forty-three killed and twenty-one wounded, while at least six hundred Sudanese died in action.\nThough al-Sihaynï was publicly hanged on 4 October, his adherents continued the struggle. They concentrated a force of about five thousand men some 80 km from Nyäla. Faced with these dangerous developments, colonial officials sent a strong punitive force that toured southern Därfür. It arrested many people, burned their houses, seized their cattle and confiscated their property. By May 1922, this period of resistance in Dar Masalït had ended.\nThe Nyäla revolt was certainly the most important revolt against colonialism in the Sudan before 1924. Unlike previous Mahdist movements, it 'nearly succeeded in its apparent immediate objective', and fully revived 'the old fear of a large-scale religiously-inspired revolt'.$^{24}$ Though the rising failed to destroy colonial rule, its limited success was taken as a warning."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.6, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in North-East Africa,', 'section_title': 'Somaliland > Local protest movements', 'content': ""Meanwhile the ever-present memory of Sayyid Muhammad's revolt entrenched the spirit of resistance in the hearts of many Somalis in the Protectorate.

The innovation of western education in the Protectorate was interpreted by religious leaders as an instrument for Christian missionary activities and consequently a threat to Islam. The attempts to foster such education in 1920 and 1935 aroused fierce resentment that culminated in two riots: at Burao in 1922 and Baro in 1936. On the latter occasion the newly-appointed British director of education was greeted with a shower of stones. 40 Equally significant were the local risings against French colonialism. Both the Afar, and the Isa Somalis, the two main ethnic groups in French Somaliland, displayed a hostile attitude towards colonial administration. The Afar Sultanates of Tadjüra and Gobaad were particularly active in this respect. The French had in fact summarily deported the Sultan of Gobaad to Madagascar in 1931. 41 The Sultan of Awsa, who had for long opposed French penetration in the area, had his own grievances during the inter-war period. French control of the region between the coast and the Ethiopian frontier deprived him of the revenues he had formerly derived from the local people and the caravan trade. Hence Sultan Yayü ambushed and arrested Lippmann, the newly appointed French governor at Dikhil. His successor, Albert Bernard, and sixteen of his Somali troops were murdered at Morheito in 1935. The activism of the Sultan of Awsa further increased after the Italian conquest of Ethiopia in 1935 and Rome's backing of Awsa's territorial claims at the expense of France. 42 The arbitrary colonial partition of Somali frontiers was done without consulting the clansmen concerned and with little or no account of clan distribution or grazing needs. The Gadabursi and Isa clans, for example, were divided between Britain and Ethiopia, and, in the case of the Isa, France also.

His programme was simple and radical: an end to colonialism - in effect Dinka independence.$^{29}$ His militant supporters made various attacks on colonial positions, but they were dispersed in February-March 1922.\nThe Nuer peoples offered another formidable challenge to colonialism in the southern region. In spite of the successive punitive patrols of the British forces, they did not accept defeat. In their eyes they had lost a number of battles but had not lost the war. Their resistance, however, reached its climax in their revolt in 1927-8.\nLed by the powerful and influential Prophet Garluark, the western Nuer refused to obey the orders of the administration. When Fergusson, the district commissioner of western Nuerland, arrived in December 1927 at Lake Jorr on an inspection tour, a crowd of several thousand Nuer warriors attacked his party. They killed him with eighteen of his people while the rest of the visiting party rushed away panic-stricken and escaped.\nSimultaneously, the Nuer people in Lou country south of the Sobat river rose against colonialism. Their influential leader, Prophet Gwek Ngundeng, refused to see colonial officials including the Governor-General himself. He sent emissaries to all parts of the Lou country and neighbouring groups of Nuer with the message to prepare for war against the 'Turks'. 30 Knowing that Ngundeng could strike at any time, colonial officials took strong measures to suppress his movement.\nThe extreme and indiscriminate violence used against these risings led to huge death and destruction. Nevertheless, the gallant resistance of the Dinka and the Nuer impressed the British colonialists that violence alone would not work.

These facts were at the time only suspected, but within the last few days they became matters of certainty. It appears that the King of Ashantee had arranged with Darko Yaw to come over to his side with all his chiefs and people, and in case the latter should decline to join, Quacoe Duah promised to send a small but efficient force to escort Darko Yaw and his immediate adherents within the Ashantee lines; after which a larger army was to proceed without delay to reduce the refractory Aquamboe chiefs to subjection, and then the whole were to march on to Accra through the Aquapem Mountains. It was also stipulated by Quacoe Duah that in order to prove his sincerity and desire to return to his former master, Darko Yaw should, when he was ready to start for Coomassie, send to Coomassie by certain confidential messengers of Quacoe Duah's then in Aquamboe, the heads of all those Ashantee chiefs that were killed by the Aquamboe part of the allied forces at the Battle of Dodowah in the year 1826, and which were kept as trophies in their hands. Darko Yaw having made all his preparations without the knowledge of his chiefs, secretly despatched the heads of the deceased Ashantee chiefs to Coomassie, and was about to follow with such few of his personal adherents as were privy to the conspiracy, when the whole affair was revealed to the chiefs by a mere accident. The chiefs at once assembled, consulted together, and resolved to act promptly, as the next day would see their King in the midst of the Ashantee force sent to escort him. It was agreed that they should go to the King, there and then, and if he could not give them a satisfactory account of his recent conduct, they should at once kill him. They went to his palace, and told him that they had come to consult with him what was best to be done to avert dangers that appeared to be coming upon them from different quarters, alluding to the threats and suspicions of the British Government and their native allies, that they were going over to the enemy. During the consultation the principal fetish priest counselled them to seek advice from their grand fetish. It was then resolved that they should all proceed to the village of Quajoe Osoo and consult the fetish. They went there with the King, who had not the slightest suspicion of their intentions; and everything being ready, the fetish priest was asked to tell what was the cause of all their recent misfortunes, and what they should do to avert further calamities. The priest replied, that they must at once send for the heads of the Ashantee chiefs that were in the King's possession, and perform certain rites over them. The King upon this displayed great uneasiness, and endeavoured to treat the matter as a joke, but the chiefs insisted on the production of the trophies, which, however, were not forthcoming.

The pioneers of this revolution in West Africa were undoubt› edly James Africanus Horton (1835-83) and Edward Wilmot Blyden (18321912). Among the works of Horton on the themes in question were Political Economy of British Western Africa, with the requirements of the several colonies and settlements: An African view of the Negro place in Nature (1865); West African Countries and Peoples: A Vindication of the African Race (1868); and Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast (1870). In West African Countries and Peoples, Horton refuted the idea of inherent racial inferiority of the black man by arguing that the difference in the stages of civilization between whites and blacks arose 'entirely from the influence of external circumstances'. To those who moved from the assump› tion of racial inferiority of the black to the assumption that he would ultimately disappear from the face of the earth in the face of white power, Horton argued: we find that wherever the African race has been carried to ... they increase, no matter under what depressing and burdensome yoke they may suffer; from which it may be safely inferred that the African people is a permanent and enduring people, and the fancies of those who had determined their destruction will go in the same limbo as the now almost defunct American slavery. 40 Finally, in answer to the proposition that the black was incapable of improvement, he argued: 'Africans are not incapable of improvement, but that by the assistance of good and able men they are destined to figure in the course of time, and to take a prominent part in the history of the civilized world'.$^{41}$ Again in his Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast, Horton wrote in the Preface: Horton not only condemned racism but was also one of the earliest advocates of pan-Africanism.

The development of the intelligentsia was determined by the specific character of European colonization and relative access to education. The social 'ceiling' for Africans in the south was far lower than in West Africa where, in the absence of a permanent body of white settlers, Africans found it easier to become clerks or secure a job in the civil service. In Southern Africa, whites had monopolized all the employment opportunities that might have been open to educated Africans, be they in the administration, the economic sector, the church or other spheres of life.\nBy the same token, the intelligentsia in Southern Africa was from its inception closer to the people. This was due to the fact that, in these regions, it derived from the midst of the indigenous population and was not initially recruited, as was sometimes the case in some West African countries, from repatriated 'freed' slaves or their descendants. The regime of cruel race discrimination, of which Africans in Southern Africa were victims without exception, inevitably tended to bring the intelligentsia closer to the people. African intellectuals there found it more difficult to play the role of inter› mediaries.\nAnother crucial distinguishing feature of anti-colonial protest in Southern Africa lies in the fact that opposition to the colonial order was recruited, not only from among Africans, but from among the sizeable non-African populations - the 'coloured people', Indians and progressive whites.

There was another aspect to this phenomenon - the scramble for African re› sources.

Just as the old European and Arab traders had bought slaves elsewhere in Africa, so the new labourrecruiting agencies scrambled for unskilled labour to work in the mining fields ... In Angola and Zambezi and Katanga (by the turn of the century) recruiting agents from the mines of the south were competing with agents from the Portuguese forced labour plantations in the Bight of Benin. 45 Just as the first Scramble for territory and sovereignty was resisted so was this second Scramble for labour. It was resisted in arms, and much of the support given to the great revolts of the early twentieth century which tried to redefine sovereignty came from men who hated forced labour. It was also resisted by desertion and strikes, by refusal to work underground, by compound riots.

The much-heralded black emigration schemes trumpeted by Garvey, whose ubiquitous publications reached deep into Africa, were only one example of a leitmotif which brought American blacks within the world view of African peoples. The themes of African redemption through American black missionaries were another.\nAfricans themselves, however, created the context of their next interaction with American blacks as they matriculated at American, largely Afro-American, schools and attended pan-African conferences and the like. Consequently, many Africans underwent a technical-educationalpolitical experience alien to their colonial world. When they re-entered their own worlds, many felt driven to resolve questions of ideology, cultural definition, educational values, political power, and pan-African unity or consciousness, guided by new perspectives.\nViewed against such an historical backdrop, the numerous pan-African conferences, Tuskegean educational and technical projects, the nØgritude movement and the occasional focus on American blacks in African millen› nial dreams, all illustrate the consistency of the pan-African theme among American and Caribbean blacks. They also show the variability of African responses to the New World overtures and ultimately the shaping by Africans themselves of these overtures to fit African specifications.\nIn sum, the populations of the African diaspora and the motive charac› terizing the many interactions between persons of the first and second black worlds included two visions. One was a vision of the union of religious forces among black populations in Africa and America or the reconstruction of Africa through importation of American and Antillean black technical expertise, initiated at the behest of American blacks. Another reflected the transformation of Africans from predicate to subject during the colonial period. The latter was a vision of the spiritual redemption, social recon› struction, and political reformation of African communities through the repatriation of African personnel and the energizing of African resources. Because of this vision, Africans had been educated in American schools, or sent to participate in technical and commercial activities; others were touched by American black writings or by anti-colonial ventures organized among blacks of the diaspora.

He sees the partition and con› quest as the logical consequence of European nibbling at Africa which started well before the nineteenth century; he accepts that the essentially economic impulse that necessitated that nibbling changed drastically during the last quarter of the nineteenth century; that the change was caused by the transition from slave to legitimate trade and the subsequent decline in both the export and import trade during that period, and that it was this economic change in Africa and the consequent African resistance to increasing European influence that precipitated the actual military con› quest.

At one extreme I have discussed Makana, the Xhosa prophet of the early nineteenth century. At the other extreme I have discussed the Zambezi rising of 1917 and its links with FRELIMO. But at least I have so far limited discussion to armed resistance to white invasion or to armed uprisings against colonial rule as it began to 'bite'; the chronological extensions arise from the uneven nature of white advance into Africa and from the still more uneven establish› ment of effective colonial control. Using this essentially political definition the period between 1880 and 1900 emerges as a crucial period of resistance, even if many of the great attempts to redefine sovereignty through protest took place later.\nIf we now turn in conclusion to the developing emphasis on economic resistance, the chronological limits become even less clearly defined. Perhaps the most radical reinterpretation is that of Samir Amin. Amin argues that the really crucial West African resistances to Europe came in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and he dismisses the resist› ances of the Scramble period itself as the half-hearted, rearguard actions of an already compromised ruling class. In Amin's eyes what was essentially at stake in the confrontation between Africa and Europe was not formal political control but Europe's attempts at economic manipulation. The truly significant African resistance was directed against such economic manipu› lation.\nAmin argues that the trade across the Sahara had 'strengthened state centralization and stimulated progress'. The European-controlled Atlantic trade, on the other hand, 'did not give rise to any productive forces: on the contrary, this caused a disintegration of society ... African societies obviously opposed this worsening of their situation, and Islam served as the basis for their resistance ... The Muslim priests tried to organize a resistance movement; their aim was to stop the slave trade, i.e. the export of the labour force, but not to end internal slavery ...

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs. It shows nice powers of observation—great diligence—a clear appreciation of facts, and a mental daring that does not shrink from the great problems of the future of the various divisions of his race, on which the light of Christian civilisation is only now beginning to shine, and who are for the most part placed under circumstances most unfavourable to its increase. After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries. Showing us their actual condition, and exposing many errors of administration which are opposed to material development and social advancement, he views the whole in connexion with the resolutions of the late House of Commons Committee, 1865, recommending the preparing of the several people for self-government. He shows the great changes that must be induced and fostered to make such self-government possible, safe, or beneficial. Though he has evidently a deep and, we believe, a just faith in his race, he does not shut his eyes to any of the disadvantages of their actual position and the difficulties in the way of their progress toward Christianity, civilisation, and wealth. The book ought to be read and studied by all educated Africans, and we should like to see it have a large circulation in England, as we consider it calculated to arouse sympathies for Africa where they have never yet been felt, and to give them a vigorous impulse where they do already exist. Our space will not allow more at present, but we shall from time to time quote from and comment upon its contents. We cannot say it is perfect in style, but the faults are very venial ones, and such as we have no doubt an increased practice in writing will cause to disappear from those future works on this interesting subject of the West African Countries and Peoples which we hope to see from this author's pen.

But even after cupidity had captured the generality there were those who saw that the abnormal relation could not be permanent under the democratic conditions of the law of the land. It was Thomas Jefferson, the writer of the Declaration of Independence, who made the celebrated utterance: ""Nothing is more clearly written in the Book of Destiny than the emancipation of the blacks; and it is equally certain that the two races will never live in a state of equal freedom under the same Government, so insurmountable are the barriers which nature, habit, and opinion have established between them."" For many years the latter part of this dictum was denounced by many good and earnest men. The most intelligent of the coloured people resented it as a prejudiced and anti-Christian conception. But as the years go by and the Negroes rise in education and culture and in proper conception of race gifts, race work and race destiny, the latter clause of that famous sentence is shorn of its obscurity and repulsiveness, and is welcomed as embodying a truth indispensable to the preservation and prosperity of both races, and as pointing to the regeneration of the African Fatherland.\n\nIt was under the conviction of the truth expressed by that statesman that certain gentlemen of all political shades and differing religious views, in 1816-17, organised the American Colonisation Society. Their labours furnished encouragement for persons desiring to free their slaves, giving them the assurance that their freed men would be returned to their Fatherland, carrying thither what Christianity and civilisation they had received.\n\nThe first phase of the Negro problem was solved at Appomattox, after the battle of the warrior, with confused noise and garments rolled in blood. The institution of slavery, for which so many sacrifices had been made, so many of the principles of humanity had been violated, was at last destroyed by violence.\n\nNow the nation confronts the second phase, the educational, and millions are being poured out by State governments and by individual philanthropy for the education of the freedmen, preparing them for the third and last phase of the problem, viz: Emigration.\n\nIt is not surprising that some of those who, after having been engaged in solving the first phase of the problem and are now confronting the second, should be unable to receive with patience the suggestion of the third, which is the emigration phase, when the Negro, shall bid farewell to these scenes of his bondage and betake himself to the land of his fathers, the scene of larger opportunities and loftier achievements.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1890#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Capabilities of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Dear Brother in the cause of God and humanity,—The elevation of Africa is near my heart, and anything that promises to aid in rescuing her from her long and deep degradation meets a warm response in my heart.

We had buried our first-born there, a little boy of six years.\n\nBut poor Africa—what can be done for her? I rejoice in the success of Dr. Livingston, and of every other explorer and labourer in Africa; but much more need to be and can be done for her. 1. She needs missionaries and teachers, but these alone will not do the work needed. Accompanying them should be (2) farmers and mechanics, who can teach them civilization, for both must go together—civilization and Christianity: either without the other will fail; but both united will, with God's blessing, lift her up, and soon give her a place among the nations.\n\nShe has natural resources abundant. 1. The people are capable of being educated in the arts and sciences, in which they make rapid proficiency when an opportunity is provided. In managing business, mercantile or other, they manifest an ability equal to the whites. The richest men in Sierra Leone are negroes who were taken out of the slave ship. They make very efficient preachers, teachers, mechanics, farmers, &c., when instructed.\n\n2. The country is rich—very productive in many things needful for commerce and home consumption. Rice, Indian corn, and some smaller grains, suited to exportation, can be produced to any extent. Ginger, pepper, arrowroot, can be supplied to meet the wants of the world. Coffee and cotton of fine quality grow wild abundantly, and can be cultivated to any extent to supply Manchester and every cotton factory in Christendom. There only needs to do this to start it all along the Western Coast, and make a market for them, and the natives will go to producing them. They will work at what they can make the most money by. Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down. These things I have seen.\n\n3. And her minerals are rich and abundant. Gold and iron ore, the purest in the world, is very abundant in many parts.

This is why the Hebrews cried to God from the depths of their affliction in Egypt, and this is why thousands of Negroes in the South are longing to go to the land of their fathers.

They must not if they could, and they ought not even if they wanted. They had laid themselves under an overwhelming load of debt to the African that centuries of beneficial work could never repay, and it would be well if they heard less about high-sounding words, schemes for the suppression of the African slave trade, and more practicable proposals for the stoppage of their equally ruin-working commerce in spirits and weapons of destruction. He might be disposed to join with such as demanded their withdrawal from Africa if it were not that on all sides he saw signs of hope, signs of the approach of a brighter day and of brighter things for the negro. With missionary enterprise starting forth on a more promising career of Christian conquest, with commerce purging itself of its criminal iniquities and joining with religion in the work of civilisation, what might not be predicted of the future of Africa? Already these remote corners had heard the glad tidings of the coming good—in a still small voice perhaps, and possibly unheeded, uncomprehended, but bound to catch the heathen ear at last, and grow in form, in volume, in harmony till it swelled into one grand paean and Christian hymn, which would be heard in every African forest depth and wild waste of jungle.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE FUTURE OF AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""This argument is, of course, based upon the results of negro self-government in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Liberia has been a black republic for forty years; Sierra Leone has been a negro colony for a century; and it cannot be denied that each of these communities has made very gratifying progress. Yet, upon Dr. Blyden's own showing, that progress has been but partial, he still has to complain of his countrymen's imitativeness and lack of backbone. The responsibility for this, undoubtedly, rests to some extent upon the unsuitable character of the education which the civilized negroes have received; but it is more to the purpose to remember that three generations is a very brief period in the development of a pagan people. How slow the work of civilization in Liberia has been may be seen from the fact that, whereas there are some twenty thousand Christian negroes in the republic, there are more than a million who are pagans. And now we inevitably come to the primary question of all: whether or not the presumed racial inferiority of the negro is proved. Dr. Blyden pleads eloquently for his fellows, and triumphantly asks: How could an inferior race have produced Toussaint L'Ouverture? The question is not unnatural, but it is far from logical. The matter, as it fashions itself to us, is, and is likely to remain for a long time to come, an open one. The negro has, as yet, enjoyed no sufficient opportunity of proving either his mental equality with or his inferiority to the white. The experience of Sierra Leone and Liberia, so far as it has gone, has been in his favour; what we know of his moral history in that other black republic, Hayti, and in the United States, is at the best negative. As time goes on, the question, which is far more momentous than would appear to the unthinking, will settle itself. Emigration from America to Liberia, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, is proceeding satisfactorily; and Dr. Blyden states that 200,000 negroes in the United States are prepared to return to the land of their fathers. But colonization by private effort is, at the best, exceedingly slow; and in this instance it is perhaps well that it is so, since the gradual settlement of Liberia is far more likely to provide material for a strong and healthy State than a hasty rush would be. Social reformers for many a year to come will watch the experiment, as they have watched it in the past, with keen interest. The chief danger lies, as Dr. Blyden constantly points out, in the tendency to Europeanize the negro—to supersede customs and practices which are useful and often necessary in Africa by customs utterly out of place there. The ill-directed zeal of some of the less reflective missionaries has, no doubt, been to blame for some of this; but there is, we fancy, very little to complain of upon this head now. Let it be once proved beyond all doubt that negroes can found flourishing colonies, can develop the limitless resources of the continent which has been the cradle of their race; and, above all, that they can govern themselves prudently and self-reliantly,—and there will open up before the black man the assurance of a future as splendid and far-reaching as any that ever presented itself to a white conqueror."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1887#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICA AND HER EVANGELIZATION', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""A friend of Africa would naturally be guided by the practical result of the religious and other means adopted for her elevation in the social scale, and her enjoyment of those advantages which Christianity alone possesses.

A general view would embrace every particular view, and the friend of Africa in general, would be found the friend of Africa in particular.\n\nI have been much struck with the similarity of feature presented by Africa in general. Without the intervention of the white man, ignorance, superstition, and idolatry, have prevailed, together with a nomadic mode of life one step only removed from that of the brute beasts around. With ignorance there have been found selfishness and cruelty, and regard for human life has been scarcely perceptible anywhere. With the white man's knowledge came also the white man's sins; and as with individuals men will be found to imitate the bad example rather than the good, so has it been with Africa in general, since only in the parts as yet unvisited by the white man is the black man found in his native simplicity and ignorance; whilst in all other parts he has acquired cunning, deceit, and mistrust.\n\nThe means originally adopted for the improvement (if improvement it could be called) of newly-discovered Africa had presently and ultimately in view gain. The possessions of the black man were coveted and craftily obtained; the black man's body even was made the subject of barter and exchange, with the object of his working for the white man's use, as cattle bought in market overt. No wonder, then, that the influence of the white man over the black was evil instead of good; and the improvement of Africa had subsequently to be effected through the removal of that mistrust and deceit which the white man's conduct had produced. Trade can be legitimate as well as beneficial. Had this been practically shown in Africa, who can calculate the enormous benefit which the white man's influence in Africa would, ere this, have brought. Some men's sins go before to judgment, and some they follow after. Transgressors go not without the punishment due to their offence, but those who follow them have the effect of their transgressions to overcome, ere they can be placed in the position they occupied before such offence was committed. Other means were doubtlessly adopted, and ultimately Christianity was brought to bear only where all these means had failed. No wonder, then, that religion was, to the black man, invested with the garment of a trade, and this investment proved against the white man, in return, the greatest hindrance to progress and improvement."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1864#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In all the coast region between the Gambia and the Cameroons the most extravagant development of tropical vegetation is seen. The great future wealth of the interior plateaux will certainly lie in their mineral deposits, the riches of the West Coast region lie in its numerous and valuable vegetable products, of which the most striking are palm oil, and ground nuts, benniseed, shea butter, rubber, gums, spices, cotton, dyes, and valuable timbers, among which ebony occupies a prominent place. With regard to animal products, I might mention ivory and monkey skins. Whereas some of the great races of the interior speak languages which connect them with the Hamitic and Semitic families. The native inhabitants of the West Coast are all that there is of most typically Negro in character; yet I do not mean they are races of particularly low development; on the contrary, the typical Negro is a fine specimen of man, and is by no means as low in his mental state as the races of Polynesia and America. I may cite the Kru tribes of that portion of West Africa which is known as Liberia, a country inhabited by an industrious, energetic, hardworking, stalwart population of free men. An element of heterogeneous ex-slave settlers among the tribes of the coast may be found in some parts of the Colonies of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos. These people represent the Nemesis which invariably follows national crimes. We and our American children indulged to a greater extent than any other European nation in the African slave trade, and, as our wrong-doing was violent and exaggerated, so to a certain extent was the abrupt reparation which followed. Although I would not minimise the work done by our blockade on the West Coast, the abolition of the slave trade was more effectually brought about by the abolition of slavery in the United States of America. One result of our suppression of the slave trade in West Africa has not been altogether advantageous. I refer to the Slave Colonies established at Sierra Leone, and at Fernando Po and other points on the coast. It may be taken that the slaves exported from any district are the least worthy people in it, and the result is that a large proportion of this population is descended from the sweepings of West Africa, and has not yet passed through sufficient generations to eliminate the ancestral badness of its progenitors. So, although here and there a negro has shown what the race can attain to under favourable circumstances, still the bulk of the ""S\'a Leone"" people who are scattered up and down the coast are of an undesirable character, and the cause of indiscriminating blame on the part of superficial observers which is most unjustly laid on the shoulders of the entire population of West Africa; whereas many of these races are superior in intelligence, enterprise, and integrity to any of our negro fellow-subjects in South Africa or the West Indies. What admirable recruits to civilised society can be obtained from many of these people may be instanced by such men as Bishop Crowther, Archdeacons Johnson and Crowther, Samuel Lewis, and other divines and lawyers and officials in West Africa, who are on a par with well-educated white men, and in some cases superior in intelligence and acquirements to the whites with whom they come in contact. It is absurd, however, to regard the Negro race, as a whole, on the same average level as the European—they are far below us. Take them in their native wilds, and they are what we were before Julius Caesar landed in this country; indeed, in many cases they are not 2,000 years behind us, but 10,000. They are in the condition of some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and Gaul, and Spain, whose history we can dimly spell out from their implements and scattered remains, who were undoubtedly cannibals and probably naked, and leading a brutish life. Yet we can in a few years drag them from the condition that prevailed 2,000 years before Christ into the year of grace 1889. We can take a cannibal from the Upper Cross River, and transport him to the centres of civilisation in England or America, where everything represents the utmost result of our present development; but what will be usually the result both with the individual and the race? The savage mind will be unable to grasp and assimilate one-third of the wonders presented to his consideration, and will probably even suffer from the shock. We cannot expect the negroes of West Africa to become all at once intelligent, self-governing people. For many years the white races must be their guardians and educators, and we must educate the negro by force if necessary, leaving him to understand us afterwards, when we have raised him to a condition to do so. This, then, is our mission in West Africa: to instruct the natives that idleness is the eighth deadly sin; next, to so instruct the native as to the existence of the resources of this country; and, lastly, to educate him in the principles of civilised society, and so assimilate his views with our own that he and we may be bound together with the ties of commerce and Empire.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Agencies at Work with Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'AMONG the signs of the times, one not the least remarkable is the variety of active agencies simultaneously at work for redeeming Africa from that filthy sleep of ages in which she has been lying, that sleep which has made her a byeword among the nations, and drawn upon her the reproach and scorn of the civilized world; for in that sleep of barbarism the most horrible dreams have exhibited themselves in action, until men have boldly stated their conviction that the slave-trade, with all its horrors, was a beneficent agent acting upon the degraded mass, calling, at least, some individuals out of it, and into that mental activity and physical refinement which vindicated the humanity of the whole race, by showing that its loathsome slumber was adventitious, and removable by the application of the same means that have been successful in other lands and', 'last_edit_date': '1875-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1875#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICAN PROSPECTS', 'section_title': '', 'content': '**THE COURSE OF CIVILIZATION.**—History proves that barbarous countries do not emerge from barbarism by development from within, but by accretion from without.

One race hands the torch of science to another; but no one seems to know how to strike the fire for itself. Had no invader gained a footing in England, this island would have remained in barbarism to this day; and America had been still the hunting-ground of the savage, had not civilization been imported. Africa is behind the rest; and yet not very far behind, for in the life of humanity three or four centuries are but as three or four years in the life of a man. She has not made time with her sister continents in the race of improvement, not because she is a sandy desert, for the fertility of her soil is exuberant, capable of enriching commerce with a profusion of valuable products which the world wants, but because she has been reserved for the habitation of black men, and the white men who attempt to explore and cultivate her perish. It was written that Africa should be redeemed by her own children; not those born on her soil, but those who shall have passed through the apprenticeship of servitude in strange lands, and learned the arts and religion of Christian nations in bondage.\n\n**CAN TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF.**—In a recent speech, ex-Governor Wright, of Indiana, said: ""As to the cant about the negro\'s ability to take care of himself, he had these facts to relate, and he would do so without comment: In 1862, the rebel Legislature of South Carolina raised a committee to inquire into the expediency of enslaving the 5,000 free negroes of Charleston. That committee reported against it, and stated that those 5,000 free negroes paid into the treasury of Charleston annually 27,000 dolls., and that their property amounted annually to 1,500,000 dolls. Out of that amount of property, 300,000 dolls. of it was composed of slaves. That the 9,000 free negroes of New Orleans in 1860 were worth as much *per capita* as the white people of Louisiana; that these free negroes had their own schools, their own benevolent societies, &c. These facts, he contended, proved that the free negro was capable of taking care of himself. He also stated that a lady who owned 500 negroes in 1860 told him that she had lost them all but 200 by the beginning of 1863. That year she made a contract with them to cultivate her farm on the shares, and that last year, under such a system, where the negro was working for himself as well as for his mistress, the 200 made her more money than 500 had done in slavery.""\n\n---\n\n**NOTICE OF PARTNERSHIP.**', 'last_edit_date': '1865-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'REVIEW', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Stanford\'s book fully justifies the title he has given to it.

It is an admirable volume for all who desire general information respecting that great continent, into the dense darkness of which the light of civilization and Christianity has begun to penetrate, through the devoted exertions of missionaries and scientific explorers.

So many active agencies are now at work in and for Africa that some more intimate knowledge of it must be desired; while yet the labour of wading through long and dreary books of African travel, with their sadly monotonous succession of pictures of sparsely-inhabited countries, and of ignorance, suffering, cruelty, and moral degradation everywhere, deters most people from seeking it in their pages.

The degree of knowledge thus to be obtained may lead some whose attention has not hitherto been called in that direction to desires and sympathies with regard to that long-neglected quarter of the world, and its wretched populations. We therefore hail its appearance with great pleasure, and strongly recommend ""Stanford\'s Compendium—Africa"" to our readers. The educated Africans of the West Coast ought all to possess it, as in it they will see what Africa really is throughout, and the opinions current respecting it and themselves. Some of these opinions are not at all flattering, and wherever our friends can show them to be unjust we shall be glad to help in correcting them through our columns.', 'last_edit_date': '1878-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1878#article-24', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True
687,Colonial narratives underestimated the Gold Coast's potential for wealth and development by attributing its challenges to cultural practices and governance rather than recognizing the complexity and richness of its cultural traditions.,"The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively illustrate the complex interplay between colonial narratives and the Gold Coast's potential for wealth and development. The General History of Africa textbook underscores how colonial narratives underestimated this potential by attributing the region's challenges to cultural practices and governance, often dismissing African history and cultural achievements. European historians like Professor A. P. Newton and Sir Reginald Coupland exemplified this dismissive attitude, while economic exploitation through unfair trade practices, as criticized by William Grant, further impoverished Africans. The colonial education system was designed to serve colonial interests rather than promote African culture and development, yet the resilience of African cultural forms suggested a rich tradition overlooked by colonial narratives. Some colonial administrators, like Sir Gordon Guggisberg, recognized the importance of maintaining African identity, though their efforts were limited. In contrast, The African Times articles present a nuanced perspective, acknowledging the Gold Coast's rich gold deposits and skilled craftsmanship, which indicate recognition of its potential wealth and cultural complexity. However, these articles also reflect colonial narratives by describing the region as mired in ""barbarism and superstition"" and attributing its challenges to local governance issues, rather than colonial exploitation. This dual narrative both underestimates and acknowledges the Gold Coast's potential, aligning partially with the claim by attributing challenges to cultural practices while recognizing inherent wealth and craftsmanship. Together, these sources highlight the complexity and richness of the Gold Coast's cultural traditions, often overshadowed by simplistic colonial explanations.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that support the claim that colonial narratives underestimated the Gold Coast's potential for wealth and development by attributing its challenges to cultural practices and governance. The text highlights the colonial perception of African societies as lacking culture and history, as evidenced by the views of European historians like Professor A. P. Newton and Sir Reginald Coupland, who dismissed African history and cultural achievements. Additionally, the textbook discusses the economic exploitation of the Gold Coast, such as the unfair trade practices criticized by William Grant, which left Africans impoverished while enriching Europeans. The colonial education system, as described, was designed to produce Africans who would serve the colonial system rather than promote African culture and development. Furthermore, the text mentions the resilience and vitality of African cultural forms despite colonial domination, suggesting a rich cultural tradition that was overlooked by colonial narratives. However, the textbook also notes that some colonial administrators, like Sir Gordon Guggisberg, recognized the importance of maintaining African identity, although their efforts were limited. Overall, the textbook aligns with the claim by illustrating how colonial narratives often ignored the complexity and richness of African cultural traditions in favor of simplistic explanations based on cultural practices and governance.","The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the Gold Coast's potential for wealth and development, which both supports and refutes the claim.

They also mention the skilled craftsmanship of native Africans in creating gold trinkets, which indicates a recognition of the complexity and richness of local cultural traditions. However, the articles also reflect colonial narratives that attribute the region's challenges to cultural practices and governance. They describe the Gold Coast as being mired in ""barbarism and superstition"" and lacking the ""inherent power of self-regeneration,"" implying a need for British intervention to achieve development. Additionally, the articles criticize the local governance and attribute the lack of infrastructure and development to mismanagement and neglect, rather than acknowledging the impact of colonial exploitation and external factors.

Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.603, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': 'Literature in European languages', 'content': ""The early 'parliamentarians' - the nominees, the assimilØs of French administration, the spokesmen of the masses approved by the British system as members of the so-called legislative councils - utilized the tongue of the alien ruler to destroy his illusions over what he had presumed were captive colonial executives.

If the articles given were simply worthless but harmless gew-gaws in exchange for articles of value, the morality of the transaction would even be reprehensible, but how much more when the articles are not only of trifling value ... but often positively destructive.

But so long as demijohn follows demijohn of rum ... no reinforcements of missionaries and no homilies from professional philanthropists, on the blessing of European civilization will avail anything. 43 An ardent campaigner for Africa-oriented educational reforms, Grant, deeply influenced by Blyden, sought an educational system which had the university at its apex but only as an institution which was designed to provide research and teaching in fields related to Africa, as opposed to the 'conventional literary education which emphasized European culture and values'.

Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent.

No less an authority than the Governor of the Gold Coast from 1919 to 1927, Sir Gordon Guggisberg, testified in 1920: 'One of the greatest mistakes of the education in the past has been this, that it has taught the African to become a European instead of remaining African. This is entirely wrong and the Government recognizes it.

African dance, art, music and traditional religious systems held their own and such borrowings and adaptations as were made by Africans were not only selective but also, to borrow M. J. Herskovits' terminology, 'additive' and not necessarily 'substitutive'. 56 Thus, in the rural areas and even to some extent in the urban ones, new beliefs, new gods, new utensils, new artefacts and new objects were added to the old ones. Certainly, in these areas, many Christians did and still do retain their belief in their traditional gods. Indeed, in the field of religion, if anything, it was the European religion that was rather Africanized as is obvious from the rituals, hymns, music and even doctrines of some of the syncretic and millenarian churches and not the other way round. What is even more important, the ground that was lost even in the urban centres in the field of culture has virtually been regained.

It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes.

The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

This neither they nor we can easily discard.'$^{4}$ It is interesting to note that another English historian, D. K. Fieldhouse, has arrived at the same con› clusion in a book published as recently as 1981: 'It would thus appear that colonialism deserves neither the praise nor the blame it has often been given for, if it did relatively little to overcome the causes of poverty in the colonies, neither did it make them poor for the first time.

We accordingly interpret European im› perialism in Africa as an engine of cultural transformation as well as of political domination.' 7 Others, mainly African, black and Marxist scholars and especially the development and underdevelopment theorists, have contended that the beneficial effect of colonialism in Africa was virtually nil. The black Guyanese historian, Walter Rodney, has taken a particularly extreme position. As he contends: 'The argument suggests that, on the one hand, there was exploitation and oppression, but, on the other hand, colonial governments did much for the benefit of Africans and they developed Africa. It is our contention that this is completely false. Colonialism had only one hand - it was a one-armed bandit.' 8 Such are the two main opposing assessments of colonialism in Africa.

The tragedy of the gifted poet from Madagascar, Jean-Joseph RabØarivelo (??-i937) who committed suicide through his - it was believed - failure to resolve this internal wrench in his colonial psyche, was a dramatic example. This gave a discernible ambiguous quality to the writings of many articulate Africans in the early period of colonial affirmation. It facilitated the policy of cultural assimilation, especially in the French, Portuguese and Spanish territories, resulting in the deliberate withdrawal from, even denial of the authentic sources of African creative genius by the new elite. 'Primitivism', either in inspiration or in images or idiom conversion, became evidence of backsliding; it delayed the total act of re-baptism which alone guaranteed acceptance into the magical society of the European colonial officials abroad.\nExceptions, especially notable in the settler situation that turned the policy of assimilado into political art were poets like Silverio Ferriera, Antonio JosØ de Nascimento and Francisco Castelbranco, whose poetry from the turn of the century denounced the racial bigotry of the settlers.

But they right themselves sooner or later. The British people and Government are committed to their progress. Efforts are made, or are at least supposed to be made, for their substantial and permanent good. The British leaven gets there. They are examined and explored and tested; their capabilities are discovered, and some one or other is sure to endeavour to utilise those capabilities. There is a basis of real property to go upon. The sense of possession gives them a real or fictitious value in the public eye, that justifies expenditure on objects and for purposes of utility and development.\n\nBut ""Her Majesty\'s forts and settlements and the Protected Territories on the Gold Coast"" are very differently circumstanced. They and their affairs are looked upon as a great bore at the Colonial-office. They are a portion of the empire to whose retention and advancement no one stands officially pledged. When any difficulties arise—and these are generally the fruit of neglect and misgovernment—there is a talk of ""giving them up."" ""Of what use are they?"" it is asked. Even the patronage of them is more troublesome than advantageous. They have not even the merit of contributing to official somnolence by quietude and stagnation. They are what our neighbours over the Channel term ""remuantes."" They give continual trouble—trouble that seems to the official mind to be about trifles; troubles the arrangement or settlement of which brings neither profit nor future peace. And why are they thus restless and troublesome? Because there are great interests of humanity at stake there—because the embryo of a mighty future is expanding within the restraints and fetters of barbarism and superstition—because a people, ready to be born, is struggling unwittingly toward the light—because realms of wealth and beauty are there endeavouring to burst the cerements of the bloody tomb in which they have been bound by an abominable superstition and by that accursed slave-trade, through whose agency we and other European nations procured labourers for raising tropical produce in the islands of the West, whose populations had been destroyed, hunted down, enslaved, deported, and annihilated by demons in human form thirsting for the mineral spoils of the new world.'}, {'id': 278, 'article_title': 'THE (COLONY OF THE) GOLD COAST.', 'full_section_title': 'THE (COLONY OF THE) GOLD COAST.', 'last_edit_date': '12-23-1863', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1863#article-15', 'issue_date': '23_12_1863', 'content': ""\n\nof the habitable globe—neglect, almost at their very doors, one of the richest gold deposits of the earth, and rest satisfied with its continuing under an atrocious system of darkness and cruelty, to dribble forth quantities which, compared with the bulk they come from, may almost be termed infinitesimal? Even so. And this does not rest upon our testimony alone; it is no discovery of ours. We do but bring forward well-known facts. Year after year, until the years count by centuries, the driblets we write of have been coming into Europe. At one time they furnished its chief supply. History says they amounted some 150 years ago to 3,500,000l. sterling a-year.* Now, in 1863, the total to Europe and America does not probably exceed 700,000l., or 800,000l. The decrease is not the result of exhaustion of metal, but of exhaustion of labourers. The population even 150 years ago was at least five times greater than it is now. Slave wars and the foreign slave-trade caused that exhaustion; as they had already, even at that remote period, reduced the inhabitants one half. At a moderate computation, it seems certain that since the Portuguese first began to import the precious metal from the Gold Coast, above 400 years ago, those lands lying between the sea and the Kong Mountains have furnished from 800 millions to 1,000 millions of pounds sterling of gold to the civilised world. And yet enlightened statesmen of the nineteenth century, because, through gross mismanagement, the Gold Coast costs for government and a shadow of defence some 20,000l. a-year more than has hitherto been raised by imposts, set their faces like flints against every proposition to make and maintain even one good road for vehicles from the Coast to the Ashantee frontier. Why, chiefly? Because they are only Protected Territories. As if Great Britain could ever abandon them; could leave them a prey to Ashantee on the one side, and slavetraders and piratical adventurers, or European rivals, on the other. She cannot leave them; let her, therefore, utilise them; let her benefit herself and them by that which they can yield. We know well that if self-interest will not induce us to make a colony of the Gold Coast, we were idle to appeal to any other feeling. If not, we should say some compunction ought to be felt with regard to territories that have literally lost through us and other European nations 800 millions sterling of treasure, and millions of their population. Lost; for what have they to show? What remains to them for that which they have thus parted with? Why countries thus endowed with wealth, and thus surrendering wealth, ought to have had at least roads, bridges, and cities to boast of. They have not one. But it is not too late. They will have them, and Great Britain must build them. They can pay her largely for them. Every fifty miles of roads and bridges, introducing and securing order, stability, progress, and enlightenment, will open a new mine of wealth. We claim for those territories, as a right, that they should be made a colony of the British Crown. Their future depends on this. They have no inherent power of self-regeneration. They are too deep in the filth of polygamy, slavery, and Devil worship to work out their own release. If they possess any arts, they are of the rudest and most primitive kind. They have neither art nor science of their own to aid them; nothing that will enable them, of themselves, to make a road, a bridge, a harbour, a breakwater, a secure roadstead—any one, in fact, of all those things that are indispensable for development and prosperity, for wealth and civilization. We claim for them, therefore, the right to be made a colony. We shall show in future articles that this may be done, not only without injustice to any, but with manifest and immense advantage to all. And we are convinced that if our public men could be brought so to give their attention to this question of making the Protected Territories on the Gold Coast a British colony as to arrive at a comprehension of the enormous national advantages that are to be obtained by so doing, the anomalous compromising character of our present relations with those territories would be put an end to by the yielding of Her Majesty's Government to an intelligent pressure for the immediate admission of those territories into the list of the colonial possessions of Great Britain.""}, {'id': 299, 'article_title': 'The (Colony of the) Gold Coast', 'full_section_title': 'The (Colony of the) Gold Coast', 'last_edit_date': '01-23-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1864#article-14', 'issue_date': '23_01_1864', 'content': 'We close these remarks in the firm belief that where care and common sense are exercised, even in the most unhealthy stations, a comparative immunity from disease may be attained.

An editor informed me that a friend of his who visited the Centennial advised him that he saw the gold trinkets from the Gold Coast, but he was told that those trinkets were made by the white settlers on the Gold Coast. I beg to deny this assertion _in toto_. In the first place, there are no white settlers on the West Coast of Africa, beginning from ""St. Mary\'s Bathurst, Gambia,"" to ""St. Paul de Loanda."" The few Europeans and Americans on that Coast are either Government officials, missionaries, or merchants. The large assortment of gold trinkets that are in the main building at the Centennial are as follows: Gold ear-rings, gold drops, gold bracelets, of various designs; gold hair-combs, gold crosses, gold brooches, in shapes of butterflies and other designs; gold rings, with the twelve signs of the Zodiac and numerous other designs; gold beads, gold studs, gold links, gold chains, gold necklaces, gold guards, gold dust, and other gold trinkets too numerous to mention; and these gold trinkets were made by the native Africans, some of whom cannot speak a word of the English language. In style of workmanship these trinkets are unequalled by anything made by civilized craftsmen the world over. Certainly there is nothing in this line in the Centennial that may be placed beside them; and when it is considered that they were wrought with rude tools, that the artizans were native men, unskilled in civilized art; that they and their fathers from time immemorial have ever lived on the Gold Coast, that they are the manufacturers of the largest assortment of trinkets in the Centennial,—then it seems to me that these men,—the ""Ashantees,"" the ""Accras,"" the ""Fantees,"" the ""Denkras,"" the ""Wassaws,"" the ""Assins,"" &c.,—should not be deprived of the meed of praise which belongs to them, but should receive the just reward for their great genius and their native art. I therefore, as an African, of which I am proud, having been born, bred and educated on that Coast, feel called upon to make this explanation. On several occasions while visiting the Centennial, I spent some time in explaining to the ladies and gentlemen who crowded around me that these trinkets were made by the native Africans, and I took great pains to impress upon their minds the capability and ingenuity of the native Africans. I would like very much that the words West Africa should be placed under the words Gold Coast, for many persons will think that the Gold Coast is in Australia or California, and thus deprive Africa of her just merits. Give to all nations, tribes, and people what is due to them.

This may be the reason that, with very rare exceptions, the Government officials on that coast are inimical to any efforts of enterprising private persons to develop the resources of that province; yea, even often go so far as to do their utmost to prevent and impede private enterprise, and with a puerile fear unworthy the English nation, hasten to inform, officially, the kings and chiefs that such and such attempt was undertaken by a private individual, and that the Government had not the least interest in it. Now, if the Government itself will not develop the resources of this rich colony, why does it interfere with private enterprise, instead of lending official aid to it, which could be done without any risk or expense to the Government, by simply letting it alone.

For us, of course, the reason of this neglect is not far to seek. It may be bad for a colony to belong to a very poor country; but it is sometimes almost as bad for it to belong to a very rich one, unless the inhabitants happen to be of themselves capable of working out their own advancement. The native Gold Coast people are not thus capable; and England has not hitherto realized the necessity of helping them. If she had held those countries, as she does now, a hundred years ago, and there had not then existed an accursed foreign Slave Trade, under which their inhabitants could be made profitable objects of purchase and sale, she might, perhaps, have set herself earnestly to work with the object of determining what might be made out of them.

Although our connexion with it has been for a period approaching two and a-half centuries, so little notice has been given to it that it is in almost as undeveloped a state as when we first came into contact with its peoples. Perusal of the letters and articles from correspondents who recently accompanied the Ashanti expedition on its march from Cape Coast Castle to Coomassie brings forcibly to one\'s mind how sadly we have been lacking in our duty in this sphere. Rich almost beyond compare in mineral and vegetable products, this field of wealth has been permitted to remain all but uncultivated. No strenuous efforts appear to have been made to open up the country; there are no roads to speak of, there are no facilities for inland transport—even at this day every gallon of palm oil, every hundredweight of rubber, every fathom of cloth, and every pound of gunpowder has to be carried on men\'s heads to and from the interior, and this in a land abounding in auriferous metal. One naturally asks—Why should this be so? The answer is not far to seek. There are several causes which account for the backwardness of the Colony, the main being the reputed unhealthiness of the climate. On this point there cannot be any doubt as to its not being favourable to Europeans, especially if they come here with constitutions in any way enervated by previous excesses, or if they indulge in excesses of any kind while here. It is imprudent for a white man to come to West Africa unless his constitution is perfectly sound and every organ in his body unimpaired; but if he is in perfect health, and will exercise ordinary care, take good food, live regularly, practice sobriety, work hard when he is at it, and will not (to use a vulgarism) funk when he has a touch of fever, he will run no greater risk on the Gold Coast than in other tropical countries. There are many Europeans known to the writer who have been in this country eight, ten, fifteen, twenty-five, and thirty years and more, with periodical visits home, and who in the majority of cases have remained in the Colony three, five, and seven years at a stretch; yet in none of these instances were the parties total abstainers, but they were temperate in all things and enjoyed perfect health. Yet these men lived in times when less attention was bestowed to sanitary matters. With ordinary care the healthy European runs no risk. Now the authorities are becoming alive to the necessities of better sanitation, and some efforts are being made to improve the sanitary condition of the principal sea-coast towns. That the country has suffered in no inconsiderable degree by its reputation for unhealthiness is evidenced by this passage which I cite from an official source: ""Against the development of the Colony by means of English capital there lies upon it the stigma of a baneful climate. But I cannot help thinking that by clearing the waterways of the Colony and thus improving the drainage of the country, by converting the bush tracks into decent roads and so improving the ventilation of the country, by a gradual conversion of the dense bush into cultivated areas, by the enforcement in the interior towns and villages of the sanitary laws which have proved so useful and advantageous in the coast towns, and by improving the means of transport, thereby enabling Europeans resident at a distance from the trade ports to have ready access to good food and the various comforts of civilisation to which they have been accustomed, and which they more than ever want in a tropical country—the climate of the Gold Coast will lose its notoriety, and the country will become, equally with other tropical countries, a safe means for the investment of capital."" But beside the climate the greatest hindrance to the rapid development of the country and its trade has been the want of proper means of transport. So long as the primitive method of carrying everything on the head prevails, the amount of trade must necessarily be narrowed still the volume of trade for 1894 shows an increase roughly of 13 per cent. over 1893 with the United Kingdom, and of 22 per cent. with foreign countries, being respectively £1,190,532 1s. 3d. against £1,054,386 17s. 6d., and £429,708 1s. 4d. and £350,387 3s. 5d. This gives one some idea of what the increase is certain to be when the produce-yielding districts of the colony are tapped by good roads and the ""iron horse."" The Government, it is said, are organising a roads department, and surveys have been made for railroads, none too soon, for they are indispensable in a country where cattle (including in that category horses, mules, and donkeys) will live only in certain localities. Irrespective of the necessity for roads and railways for produce, the same facilities for access to the gold mining districts cannot be lost sight of; it is the yellow metal which has given its name to the colony. Since the fifteenth century it is estimated that six or seven millions of gold have been exported from the goldfields. Anterior to the discovery of Australian or Californian gold the principal supply of the auriferous metal was obtained from the West Coast, in particular from this land. Whoever has travelled over the country has been struck with indications of the precious metal almost everywhere. It outcrops in reefs, it is discovered in sand, and found in the beds of its rivers; you will see it being washed for in the streets. Why, then, has not the country become a great gold mining centre? I doubt very much whether California itself ever presented to the naked eye the tempting wealth of gold which so forcibly attracts the attention of the traveller in the western districts of the Gold Coast. With plenty of capital for the developments of its properties and under European and native control, any enterprise for the development of the gold industry in this colony ought to be a substantial success.—*Liverpool Journal of Commerce.*', 'last_edit_date': '1896-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1896#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The special report of Sir W. B. Griffith, the Governor of the Gold Coast Colony, to Lord Knutsford will show how it comes that that coast has got its name. It has been known for centuries that gold existed in the rivers and the soil of the region immediately behind the coast, and in their own primitive way the natives have probably worked it from time immemorial. Moreover, at various times English companies have been floated for the purpose of mining the precious metal. Machinery has been sent out, and white men have been sent out to superintend it. But either the machinery never got out of the bush, where some of it may still be seen, or the works had to be abandoned from bad management or from the death of the white men who superintend them. Sir W. B. Griffith, in the report just issued, gives a melancholy list of the companies that have been started, got up capital, and come to grief in their efforts to utilise the gold of the Gold Coast. Happily the Governor has a more hopeful story to tell. His report is really the narrative of a journey he made up the Ancobra river in the early part of the present year, and of the various mines he visited which are being successfully carried out under white superintendence. He tells what he saw at the Akankoo, the Gie Appantoo, the Prestea, and other mines, where shafts have been sunk to considerable depths to get at the quartz, where machinery has been erected, stamps fitted up, Europeans are carrying on their work successfully, and hundreds of natives are employed. So far the yield of gold per ton has been moderate, but quite sufficient to give a fair profit on the outlay. The surface has as yet only been scratched, and further careful exploration, especially in the interior, might yield profitable results. Sir W. B. Griffith sums up the position succinctly and clearly. He is convinced that the country is rich in gold, and that it is merely a matter of the necessary time and scientific application for that gold to pay well for extraction. Earnest and well-considered attempts, he states, are now being made to secure success. The country once opened up and cultivated would yield rich returns to capital invested in the economic agriculture of any kind of tropical produce. But unfortunately—and this is the fatally weak point—the natives of the country cannot be relied upon to supply the necessary labour, which must come either from the Kroo country or from China. Chinese it would be a pity to introduce here. The Krooman are well known as the great workers of West Africa, and surely it need not be difficult to obtain a supply of them. At the same time, by patient and intelligent effort, the natives themselves might receive a stimulus to labour when once they saw it would be to their advantage. We believe that in this respect Governor Moloney has met with some success in Lagos. As to the suitability of the region for the residence of white men, we now know so well the conditions under which health can be maintained in the tropics that no man with a sound constitution to start with need come to grief if he give himself fair play. There is no doubt that the Gold Coast is a most trying region for white men, though the high ground of the interior ought to yield a much better climate.—Times.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-11-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_11_1889#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Gold Coast Gold', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following interesting and instructive letter appears in a recent issue of the *Globe* :—\n\nSir,—There is plenty of auriferous country on the Gold Coast of West Africa, much of which could be worked with profit and advantage, if exploited by experienced men, who were not hampered in their mode of operations by inexperienced directors. What brought the place into so much disrepute was not only the climate, which, although bad enough in places, can be guarded against materially by care and attention to living, but the wretched mismanagement of so many gold mining companies that were brought out during the great boom in the early eighties, causing not only much disappointment, but loss of life and much capital.\n\nI was commissioned to go out to the Gold Coast in 1881, and on my return reported favourably of the auriferous prospects of the country in some articles that appeared in *The Mining Journal*, as also in my work on ""Our Gold Supply,"" in which I pointed out how the evil effects of the climate might be mitigated by precaution. Yet a number of enthusiastic amateur managers went out to the Gold Coast to take up concessions and manage gold mines, nearly all of whom came to grief, as also the companies they represented—in fact, the West African gold boom burst up through the incapacity and folly of many who had the assurance to undertake the expenditure of capital in a business they were wholly unacquainted with, while the climate laid low many strong men, as also imprudent ones, who could not stand the climate. Some men have enjoyed good health for years on the Gold Coast, but most men feel the effects of the climate after a while, and are glad to get away from the country. To explore the West African gold country and to open up mines for profitable working require experienced, careful, and steady men, with systematic management, and special attention paid to the diet of the men employed, and their general health. European managers, mechanics, and miners who have to be sent out to the Gold Coast at great expense, require careful selecting, and to be well cared for when on the mines. The heavy and unskilled labour must be done by Natives—Kroomen, coolies, and others—who, with a little teaching, make fair workers.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1896#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Gold Coast Gold', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It is easy to understand how the Gold Coast obtained its notoriety for rich gold deposits, as also the unhealthiness of the climate. In travelling through the country there is ample evidence to show that the shallow alluvial deposits and the outcropping of auriferous quartz lodes had been worked for gold in a primitive way in many places long ago, and at a time when population was more dense than now. The Native Chiefs or Kings, who held sway over large numbers of men, women, and children, could enforce their working for gold, and a very small quantity produced by each daily would, in the aggregate, amount to much. Thus, supposing a King or Chief ordered his men, who were mostly slaves in those days, to get him gold, they had to do it—5,000 Natives washing in their crude way with wooden dish bowls or shells, and each averaging only ¼ dwt. or 1 dwt. of gold per day, the total would amount to a handsome sum every week; and this is how the kings and headmen of the various tribes were always known to be wealthy in gold and slaves, and it gave encouragement to the development of trade and traffic (which was so profitable) in those articles, for which this unhealthy coast was so noted.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1896#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE GOLD FIELDS OF WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'M. Bonat, Mr. J. L. Wilson, Sir John Glover, and Dr. Clarke also speak of the abundance of gold. Captain Burton and Commander Burton had very high opinions of this country as a gold producer. Mr. Thomas Cornish visited the Gold Coast as mining expert with Commander Cameron, and spoke well of the prospects. It is commonly thought that the richest deposits have not yet been found, and the districts we are already acquainted with, we do not know in depth. What the depth of the gold-bearing strata is no one seems to have ventured to say. The gravel beds which form the valley of the Tacquah have not been worked to any depth, and as the weight of gold is seven times greater than gravel we should naturally expect to find the richer deposits in depth, in the same way as in the well known hydraulic mines of Western America. The great drawback is the climate, which is generally admitted to be bad, although Europeans have been known to live on the coast for 20 and 30 years. Europeans often in countries like the Gold Coast indulge in excesses which undermine their health, although I cannot for one moment think that all those who have returned with broken health come under this category. Fevers, we know, prevail, and exposure to night dews is courting death. We are interested in\n\nother countries which have the reputation of unhealthiness, such as some parts of South America and India. No doubt by the exercise of the greatest precautions much sickness might be avoided, but we have still the fact that it is dangerous, and that the excessive heat is enervating. This hindrance can only be overcome by the introduction of intelligent and industrious negroes from other parts of the coast. It requires large capital to develop the resources, and it should be known that it is no country for the single-handed prospector.\n\nThere has not been any reliable record kept of the returns of the Gold Coast, nor would it have been very possible to do so, however much desired, the commercial interest having been up to within a few years ago of an indefinite character. At the beginning of the century the gold product was estimated from £300,000 to £3,000,000 annually. Of late years it has been about 25,000 ounces.

In the various places to which he went Sir B. Griffith collected around him native chiefs and merchants, in order to hear from themselves their views and wishes. At Pram Pram, the King, an old man, wanted nothing save to be allowed to revive an old custom, part of which consisted in the exhumation of the dead. At Quetta the chiefs and people said they had nothing to say about the state of the district of his Excellency, but they did desire that the duty on spirits, which had been lowered experimentally from 2s. 6d. to 1s. a gallon, might be lowered still further to 6d. a gallon; they were glad that the *ad valorem* duties were abolished, and complained that traders were molested on one of the roads. The Governor told them he was determined to stop the smuggling of rum, and advised them to cultivate cotton. The desired remission in duty on spirits appears to have been refused. The Afflowho chiefs were also warned against smuggling, and told the great advantages of growing cotton. At Big Awoonah the chief sent a friendly message, which the Governor acknowledged with a present of half a sovereign and two bottles of champagne. At Addah there was an important meeting; the people there wanted a road to the beach, a school, stipends to the chiefs, the reduction of the duty on rum to 1s. a gallon, wells, a public bell to mark the time, a free ferry across the Volta River, and a warehouse on the beach. To these the Governor replied that he would help them to make the road, but they must help themselves; that he could not see why they wanted a school, seeing that they had already two, of which they did not avail themselves; he could not promise them stipends or reduce the rum duty; they would have their bell, and would be shown how to sink wells; the ferry would be considered, and they could not want a warehouse on the beach. Here, again, smuggling and cotton came up as before. On the following day the chiefs expressed a wish to have another interview with the Governor. They pressed him to reduce the rum duty, and to give them stipends; but after a lengthy discussion the Governor succeeded in sending them away in good humour; but without cheaper rum or the stipends. They did not press him a second time on the school question. At Odumassie the King received the Governor in great state, and, in return, the latter impressed upon his Majesty, his chiefs, and women the importance of cotton, and the advantages of the Basle missionaries. The King begged for a pair of handcuffs to enforce his powers, and a lamp; King Akrobato, whose capital is two hours’ journey from that of the King of Odumassie, also wanted a lamp and handcuffs. At Akropong the King and chiefs gave the Governor the most imposing reception he had had. ""I expatiated as usual upon cotton and cocoa cultivation."" The King said that the cocoa plants the Governor had sent him had all failed; he and his chiefs were anxious to know how they could recover debts due to them, and they also wanted to be paid in cash in place of gin for palm oil. On the whole the situation appears to be this—the Government want the people to grow cotton, cocoa, and coffee, so that they may not be wholly dependent on palm oil; to go to school, not to molest travellers, not to smuggle, and to keep the roads and wells in order. The people do not appear to care about any of these things.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1888#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Gold Coast Colony', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Colony, which was prosperous already, should not very rapidly become still more so.

The African Times now occupies an acknowledged position as the registrar and exponent of native wants and progress, and the advocate of native interests, more especially on the West Coast. Our aim in the future will ever be, as it has been in the past, to make it practically useful; and we again solicit the support of all who have at heart the real welfare of native Africa and its people, both for this Journal and for the Society by which it was founded, and to whose efforts with Government and individuals so much of its power for good may be attributed. And more especially do we commend the African Times and the African-Aid Society to the warm and earnest support of the educated Africans of the West Coast. The African Times brings them, as well as their rulers, face to face with British public opinion, by which they have much to gain in the work to which we hope they all feel themselves pledged—viz., that of the Christian civilization of the whole African people, and the industrial development of those great natural resources with which Africa has been so liberally endowed.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-07-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_07_1865#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TRIBUTE TO THE ""AFRICAN TIMES.""', 'section_title': '', 'content': '[We cannot refrain from making the following brief extracts from the letter of a valued correspondent.

Sierra Leone has a population of over 60,000 inhabitants; Freetown, the capital, contains over 20,000. Cannot some intelligent young men devote a few days on behalf of our great advocate, the African Times? They can do it in this way, Mr. Editor. Let these young men hold public meetings in Freetown, inviting all and everyone, by having public notices posted about the streets a few days before the meetings, and in these meetings lay before the people the immense good the African Times has done and is doing for us; and there have a list and ask everyone to come forward, both men and women, and have their names enrolled as subscribers to the African Times, and on the next day go round and collect the subscriptions and hand them over to our indefatigable and warm-hearted advocate and champion, William Rainy, Esq., with the names of the subscribers. If this seems to be too much trouble, let the young men go round with a list, in the afternoons and evenings after business hours, to every house in the name of Mr. Rainy (having first asked that gentleman the privilege of using his name) and persuade every man and woman to subscribe to the African Times by explaining to them the good that paper has done for us. The name of Mr. Rainy, amongst the people of Sierra Leone and along the Coast, will get any amount of subscribers; and there is scarcely a man or woman in Sierra Leone amongst the 60,000 inhabitants who cannot subscribe 5s. a-year—except he or she is a real pauper—and I believe you will hardly find 6,000 paupers in the above population. Allow me to say, Mr. Editor, if this is done Freetown alone will add to the present subscribers some 5,000 subscribers; Waterloo, the largest village, whose population is over 10,000, can produce 500 subscribers; Kent, York, and Bananas can produce 500 subscribers; Kissy about 200 subscribers; Hastings and Wellington about 250 subscribers; Wilberforce, Lumley, and Godrich can produce about 200 subscribers; Bathurst, Charlotte, Regent, Glocester, and Leicester can give about 300 subscribers; Benguema, Camp...', 'last_edit_date': '1868-11-08', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1868#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE ACTION OF THE AFRICAN-AID SOCIETY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Africa, anything beyond the mere egotism of surface philanthropy, it will find fresh support.

When we review the history of our country from the time of the publication of that valuable journal of which you are the honoured editor—a periodical which stands eminent in consequence of the incalculable benefit it has conferred upon us—we say, when we contrast Africa\'s past with her present; when we look upon the many moral changes the African Times has effected, we could not but classify it amongst the means employed by Divine goodness towards the regeneration of a people who, according to the views of the anthropologist, are deprived of that vital essence which constitutes man the chief of God\'s creatures; hence with them the negro is calculated to be unfit for any other position than to become ""a beast of burden and a beast for prey"" to his more favoured brother.

During that period the whole of the anxiety, labour, and responsibility, both public and pecuniary, which it has involved, have been borne by one individual, the Editor. When first started, he undertook, subject to the condition of a certain number of copies being subscribed for individually by some members of the Council of the African-Aid Society, that it should never involve that society in any pecuniary loss or responsibility. Contrary to his opinion as to the conditions under which a public journal could be successfully conducted, and submitted to by him solely with the object of facilitating its establishment, a committee of a few members of the council of that society was appointed to meet monthly, prior to its publication, for considering the articles, &c., which the Editor had decided to insert. But to this the Editor attached a stipulation that he would not consent to any alterations of which he did not himself fully approve, and which he did not consider advisable or innocuous. Such a committee of course could not work, and the Editor freed himself almost immediately from the nominal restriction, which only served to increase the difficulty of bringing out the paper on the proper day, without effecting any useful purpose whatever. A perfect and entire independence of thought and opinion in the editor is essential to the success of any and every public journal. During five years, therefore, the whole labour and responsibility have, as before stated, rested with one individual, the present Editor. Such an anniversary as this is therefore a solemn one with us. The objects the Editor has endeavoured ever to keep in view have been the promotion of good government in the British African colonies and settlements, to force a removal of official abuses, to promote material development and increased facilities of transit and trade, as auxiliaries to missionary effort, and as indispensable, not to the reception of Christianity, but to the existence and spread of Christian civilization in Africa. Having entered upon this work with a deep sense of responsibility to God, we feel bound to ask ourselves how that work has been performed. With the measure and extent of its success we have nothing to do, that we leave in the hands of Him who worketh through individual agencies on the earth, according to His own infinite wisdom. But have we done our duty by the African people, and have they, on their side, done their duty towards us? As regards the former, we can only look to our motives and our desires. We have endeavoured to keep a watchful guard over ourselves as ""one who must give an account before God,"" and we have, with no small sacrifice of time and rest, conscientiously striven to give to Africa in our labours whatever talent or wisdom God may have bestowed upon us for that purpose. As regards the latter, we think we have cause of rejoicing rather than of complaint. The number of our African subscribers has continuously increased, filling up, in a way most satisfactory to us, the gaps in our subscription list caused by the withdrawals of those of our early friends who considered, we suppose, that no further effort on their part was necessary to our support. And we have given a voice—a public voice to Africa. Few people in England, unfortunately, care much about her or her concerns. The English Anti-Slavery party, fully occupied in their high and noble object of the eradication of negro slavery everywhere, have not yet had time generally to recognise the importance of paving the way, and preparing for, and aiding in the work of Christian civilization in Africa itself.

It should be borne in mind that originally the journal was of only eight pages of a smaller-sized paper—that gradually it was increased to twelve, and frequently during the past six months to sixteen. But there is no engagement to continue to furnish such a quantity monthly, although the intention is to do so if the funds will allow. The paper is edited and conducted gratuitously; and all that can be obtained from the sale of copies and from advertisements is devoted to its improvement and enlargement. But unless a special fund were raised for the paper the Editor cannot risk loss. Eight pages of the size now issued are nearly equal to twelve of the previous size. The Editor hopes, however, by the blessing of God, to maintain the issue at twelve, and even at sixteen pages of the new and increased size. Subscribers may aid in this by obtaining ADVERTISEMENTS and other SUBSCRIBERS for the journal, without which it cannot be accomplished. They should bear in mind that although their five shillings per annum per copy, including postage or delivery, is a shilling or two a-year dearer than some other journals of a similar size and paper are supplied at, the AFRICAN TIMES is a special paper, that will only be taken by a special class of readers—that it cannot hope to be popularised into cheapness except as education and civilization progress on the West Coast of Africa—and that in return for that individual sacrifice of a shilling or two a-year the Editor gives time, anxiety, and such little talent as he may possess, without any reward, save the hope that he may be in some measure advancing the great cause of Christian civilization and industrial development in Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1865#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'OUR THIRD VOLUME.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have therefore no hesitation in calling upon our friends and subscribers not only to continue to us their individual support, but also to use their efforts for obtaining _new subscribers to this journal_, and _new subscribers to the African-Aid Society_, upon whose prosperity so much of the future usefulness of this journal depends.

Indeed, if anything, the emigration tradition championed earlier by blacks like Daniel Coker, Lott Cary, John B. Russwurm, Paul Cuffee, Henry H. Garnet and Martin R. Delany, was continued and enlarged upon in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. In 1878, for example, the South Carolina-Liberian Exodus Joint Stock Steamship Company brought 206 black immigrants to Liberia. In 1881, Henry H. Garnet was appointed resident minister and consul-general to Liberia, fulfilling his own earlier convictions; and in 1889, the St Thomas-born West Indian pan-Africanist, Dr Edward W. Blyden, visited the United States from Liberia on behalf of the American Colonization Society (ACS) to help generate black support for emigration. Moreover, between 1880 and 1900, Bishop Henry NcNeal Turner laboured to combine the two traditions long dominant in the modern history of African/Afro-American interaction: African emigration and Christian evangelism. Similarly, widespread interaction between Africans and American blacks occurred because of the return of thousands of Brazilian blacks to West Africa until the time of the official abolition of slavery in Brazil (1888). Upon resettlement in or near their previous homes in Nigeria, Dahomey (now Benin), Togo and the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the Afro-Brazilians' technical and commercial competence and political aspirations seem to have broadly affected the social, economic and political conditions there. Possibly because of the absence of differentiation of them› selves as a corporate community of settlers in their regions - such as was the case in Liberia - there were subsequently little differentiation between the social and political goals of indigenous Africans and Afro-Brazilians."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The diaspora and Africa', 'content': ""While Africans who came to the New World can be numbered in millions, their descendants who returned to Africa amounted to only a few thousands.$^{56}$ Many reasons account for this, not the least of which was the significant lack of support to establish the type of transportation system which had previously facilitated the westward trans-Atlantic flow. Repatri› ation during the nineteenth century offered few material rewards for Europeans or non-Europeans. But by 1900, the divergence between Africa and the Americas had become too great. Persons of African descent became caught up in the self-consciousness of the age which produced the type of xenophobic nationalism that all but destroyed the appeal of Africa. More› over, the interest in Africa after the end of the slave trade grew from national lusts for power and wealth - and Afro-Americans lacked both political power and the wealth needed to stimulate their own interest, or influence those who were partitioning Africa into colonial spheres. The Afro-American view became focused more on the new developments within their hemisphere. Internal and inter-regional migrations and the quest to establish the good life against new deleterious challenges absorbed their attention. The African connection faded, but did not die. The return-toAfrica movement found individual promoters who could occasionally infuse the movement with new appeal. In 1897, Henry Sylvester Williams, a Trinidadian-born lawyer living in London, founded the Pan-African Association, whose later membership would include George Padmore, Kwame Nkrumah and C. L. R. James. In the 1920s Marcus Garvey founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association, a movement designed to spur African decolonization and unite all Africans wherever they were found.

Ford himself answered such a call by a delegation of Fälasa (black Ethiopian Jews) and left for Ethiopia in 1930 where he evidently remained until his death during the time of the Italian-Ethiopian War (1935-6).$^{I2}$ The majority of the American emigrants Ford encountered in Ethiopia when he arrived there were Jamaicans, and, occasionally, other Afro-Caribbean folk. A recent account suggests that 'the West Indians appear to have been more prepared than some of the Americans to make what adjustments were necessary to living in Ethiopia' although both groups suffered discrimination from time to time. 1 3 Of course, even before Garvey's time, other American blacks had emigrated to Ethiopia, but as individual settlers. For example, in the 1890s Benito Sylvain, a Haitian, brought to the Court of Menelik II a plan for a 'Pan-Negro' organization. Clearly, however, the largest waves of American black immigrants came in the late 1920s and early 1930s, that is, after Garvey's break with the Liberians and through the time of the Emperor's accession, with the greatest numbers of these responding to meetings with Ethiopian travellers. In the period immediately following the restoration of Haile Sellassie in 1941, a new trickle of Afro-Americans (possibly twenty) came to Ethiopia. The period, however, falls beyond the scope of this chapter. Suffice it to say that the numbers of black immigrants from the Americas to Ethiopia peaked during activities associated with Garvey, Ford and the Emperor and were not equalled before or after that era. 14"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Back-to-Africa movements', 'content': ""While in Liberia, Bishop Turner advised what he called American 'black capitalists' that 'if they would start trading with Liberia they would be worth millions in a few years'. Few responded, although a group did organize the African Development Society in 1899, the chief objective of which was to encourage Afro-Americans to buy land and settle in East Central Africa. The Society would sell shares or land rights offered by African petitioners but only to Afro-American or African purchasers. 4 Bishop Turner also later served as an adviser to the International Migration Society (IMS) of Alabama, which sent about 500 emigrants to Africa before it became defunct in 1900. Some of the 500 remained in Liberia; others returned to the United States. Those who remained fared reasonably well; evidently more than a few of them prospered. On the other hand, those who returned told horror stories of poor land, inadequate food and poor living conditions. These stories reduced the likelihood of any large-scale Afro-American emigration movement, even though prospects for blacks in the United States were declining from 1895 to 1900. Nevertheless, numerous Afro-Americans evidently continued to give serious consider› ation to African emigration, just as others in the United States and the Caribbean simply moved away from overt discriminatory practices into other regions near by.\nAfter the turn of the twentieth century, the back-to-Africa baton was picked up by others. For example, one Captain Dean, early in the twentieth century, hoped to engineer the settlement of American blacks in South Africa to fashion a powerful black state there. After the briefest sojourn meant to arrange for this settlement, however, white authorities expelled Dean from the Cape for what were termed 'provocative activities'. And in 1914, Chief Alfred C. Sam, a Gold Coast African, turned up in Oklahoma, persuaded about sixty black farmers that Africa offered them greater oppor› tunities and sailed with them to Saltpond in the Gold Coast. Finding Chief Sam's claims to be exaggerated and encountering restrictions from the Gold Coast officials which inhibited the entry of American immigrants, most of the Oklahomans eventually returned to the United States. But no one made so deep an impression as an advocate of emigration on Africans and American blacks alike as did Marcus Garvey who was born in Jamaica in 1887."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The diaspora and Africa', 'content': ""But the thought of Africa remained a constant theme, pursued with varying degrees of seriousness by both white and black Americans. In the USA, the idea of the repatriation of Africans had been mentioned occasionally throughout the eighteenth century, most notably in 1777, when Thomas Jefferson sponsored a report in a committee of the Virginia legislature. Repatriation began in earnest after 1815, however, when a small group of thirty-eight black Americans led by Paul Cuffe returned to Africa. By 1830, Liberia had become the focus for a general colony of repatriated Africans, mostly ex-slaves, sponsored by the American Colonization Society with the financial support of the Federal as well as many State governments. By i860, only about 15000 settlers had returned to Africa. After the Civil War, less than 2000 settlers made the trip, despite the rapid deterioration of the conditions of life for Afro-Americans in the USA.\nTwo other sources provided returning immigrants. The first came from the unknown number of maroons and Africans taken from confiscated slave ships during the nineteenth century, and shipped back to Africa by the British in their zealous attempt to terminate the trade in slaves and replace it by 'legitimate' trade. The second source of African returnees came from an even smaller number of missionaries recruited in the Caribbean and southern states of the USA, principally by the Moravians and Presby› terians, to assist in the propagation of the Christian Gospel in West Africa. The most well-known example of this is perhaps the Basel Mission enterprise among the Akwapim hills of Ghana in the 1830s and 1840s, and their decision in 1843 to use Jamaicans as substitutes for German and Swiss missionaries whose mortality in the field proved too high for evan› gelical efficacy."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Conclusions', 'content': 'In broad pan-Africanist terms, however, the evidence seems clear that African political and ideological visions were expanded and technical expertise was improved because of colonial African interactions with American blacks. The much-heralded black emigration schemes trumpeted by Garvey, whose ubiquitous publications reached deep into Africa, were only one example of a leitmotif which brought American blacks within the world view of African peoples. The themes of African redemption through American black missionaries were another.\nAfricans themselves, however, created the context of their next interaction with American blacks as they matriculated at American, largely Afro-American, schools and attended pan-African conferences and the like. Consequently, many Africans underwent a technical-educationalpolitical experience alien to their colonial world. When they re-entered their own worlds, many felt driven to resolve questions of ideology, cultural definition, educational values, political power, and pan-African unity or consciousness, guided by new perspectives.\nViewed against such an historical backdrop, the numerous pan-African conferences, Tuskegean educational and technical projects, the nØgritude movement and the occasional focus on American blacks in African millen› nial dreams, all illustrate the consistency of the pan-African theme among American and Caribbean blacks. They also show the variability of African responses to the New World overtures and ultimately the shaping by Africans themselves of these overtures to fit African specifications.\nIn sum, the populations of the African diaspora and the motive charac› terizing the many interactions between persons of the first and second black worlds included two visions. One was a vision of the union of religious forces among black populations in Africa and America or the reconstruction of Africa through importation of American and Antillean black technical expertise, initiated at the behest of American blacks. Another reflected the transformation of Africans from predicate to subject during the colonial period. The latter was a vision of the spiritual redemption, social recon› struction, and political reformation of African communities through the repatriation of African personnel and the energizing of African resources. Because of this vision, Africans had been educated in American schools, or sent to participate in technical and commercial activities; others were touched by American black writings or by anti-colonial ventures organized among blacks of the diaspora. This latter vision seemed not so much to discard as simply to vindicate and to reorientate to an African perspective the idealism implied in the earlier vision.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The abolitionist movement produced other far-reaching consequences for the area; of these, perhaps the most significant were those concerned with the modernization process.

This is true of Haiti, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Barbados, for example.

The first consists of countries such as Colombia, Panama and Nicaragua, which contain small, somewhat tightly-knit population groups of African origin. The second group consists of those countries which have groups of African origin which have not undergone an integration process in the New World, such as Surinam where the Bonis, the Djukas, the Saramacas and the Akwas are found, and Jamaica, Santo Domingo and even Haiti and Cuba, the home of the maroons. Living in the forest, groups in Suriname and in French Guiana have retained more or less intact their fundamental cultural values and a certain social organization. The maroons were communities of run› away slaves who took refuge in the mountains of those countries, thus cutting themselves off from contact with the colonizers. At least a good portion of these communities succeeded in maintaining themselves isolated from the former colonizers. Later on, in Suriname, French Guiana and, to a certain extent, in Jamaica, they held themselves aloof from what could be called the 'national community'.\nFrom the demographic standpoint, the composition of the population of each country should be carefully checked with reference to three main groups: the population of African origin, that of European origin and, lastly, that of local origin - the 'Amerindians'.

Cre› ativity became especially necessary where a small number of Europeans lived among a large number of Africans as was the case in many colonies of exploitation such as Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Saint-Domingue.

For centuries marronage, or the flight from the slave system, existed as an integral aspect of slavery.$^{53}$ In Brazil, the north-east witnessed the establishment of the quilombo of Palmares which lasted almost a century and which was eliminated only with the largest military force ever mounted in the Americas by the Portuguese and Brazilians. Maroon towns existed for equally long periods in Esmeraldas in Ecuador and in parts of the Blue Mountains and the Cockpit Country of Jamaica. Marronage manifested not only the wish to be free, it was an eloquent and visible condemnation of the system of slavery by Africans.\nBy the time African slavery was eliminated in the Americas, the position of the African sector had worsened dramatically from what it had been a century before.

However, it leaves on one side the continuing prestige of African cultural values in the New World, although of course one may hold the view that this can only be measured by using a racial criterion or that it is not an important variable.\nHere there are two conflicting schools of thought. The position taken by M. J. Herskovits$^{70}$ regarding the 'reinterpretation' of African culture as reflected in continuing cultural elements, provoked the black North American sociologist, E. Franklin Frazier$^{7}$ ' to draw attention to the central problem of integration in society as a whole. As Frazier saw it, Herskovits' theory could lead to the conclusion that the persistence of African cultural values might be regarded as evidence supporting the racialist argument that blacks cannot be assimilated. In the United States, on account of various factors including the work of the Protestant churches, the former slaves lost most of their traditional African cultural values and became part of the Anglo-Saxon cultural world.\nThe parallel between North America and South America and the Caribbean in terms of the African presence and particularly of African cultural values is not conclusive, for the situations were very different in view of the different ways in which the former slaves became 'integrated' in those regions, even from one country to another.\nFrom the cultural standpoint, whereas in the United States conversion to the Protestant religion led to the forsaking of cultural traditions and to the emergence of a new outlook, in Latin America and the Caribbean African cultural values persisted to varying degrees or underwent a process of transformation.\nMethodologically, two forms of presence should be distinguished: the cultural presence of Africa and the Negro presence in the physical sense.

A feeling of ethnic identity grew out of this shared historical experience, in which increases in population and agricultural productivity, and also encouragement of individual enterprise, played a key role. During the same period, in small high-density areas on the upper Tshikapa and the upper Kasai, there were many young Chokwe who were prepared to leave their villages and the burdensome power of the chiefs and take to the open forest, hunting elephants, setting up hives and collecting the honey and wax.

It is different after they have had wives, children, and relatives kidnapped; but that is more than human nature, civilised or savage, can bear. In the case in question indiscriminate slaughter, capture, and plunder took place. A very large number of very fine young men were captured and secured in chains and wooden yokes. I came near the party of Syde Bin Habib, close to the point where a rent in the mountains of Rua allows the escape of the great river Lualaba out of Lake Moero. And here I had for the first time an opportunity of observing the difference between slaves and freemen made captives. When fairly across Lualaba Syde thought his captives safe, and got rid of the trouble of attending to and watching the chained gangs by taking off both chains and yokes. All declared their joy, and perfect willingness to follow Syde to the end of the world or elsewhere, but next morning twenty-two made clear off to the mountains. Many more, on seeing the broad Lualaba roll between them and the homes of their infancy, lost all heart, and in three days eight of them died. The had no complaint but pain in the heart, and they pointed out its seat correctly; though many believe that the heart is situated underneath the top of the sternum or breast-bone. This to me was the most startling death I ever saw. They evidently died of broken-heartedness, and the Arabs wondered, \'seeing they had plenty to eat.\' I saw the others perish, particularly a very fine boy of ten or twelve years of age. When asked if he felt ill he put his hand correctly and exactly over the heart. He was kindly carried, and as he breathed out his soul was laid gently on the side of the path. The captors were not unusually cruel. They were callous—slaving had hardened their hearts. When Syde, who was an old friend of mine, crossed the Lualaba, he heard that I was in a village where a company of slave traders had been furiously assaulted for three days by justly-incensed Babeemba. I would not fight nor allow my people to fire if I saw them, because the Babeemba had been especially kind to me. Syde sent a party of his own people to invite me to leave the village by night, and come to him. He showed himself the opposite of hard-hearted; but slaving \'hardens all within, and petrifies the feelings.\' It is hard for the victims, and for the victimisers.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1872#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.603, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ancient Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'hair of Buddha belong to the black race, and Nahsi is the negro name.

The articles refute the notion of the Ocrah holding significant political power, likening their role to that of a valet or cook in an English household, and emphasize that their advice carries as much weight as that of a pet, underscoring their lack of political authority. The misconception of the Ocrah as a counselor or adviser to the king is criticized as ignorance of Ashantee customs, aligning with the claim that their perceived authority is a misunderstanding of the true social hierarchy.

As mentioned above, Ethiopians, as contrasted to Nubians, Sudanese and East Africans, were much favoured and did lighter work.$^{16}$ J. L. Burckhardt, the Victorian traveller, observed that, alongside their bonded compatriots, poor African pilgrims largely from West Africa - known locally as 'Tekrourys' - served during their sojourn as porters, dockers, streetsweepers, firewood-fetchers, makers of pots, mats and baskets, and brewers of an intoxicating drink called 'bouza'. 17 In India, the African slave undertook a number of menial tasks which Indians either could not (because of caste restrictions) or would not perform, or for which the British deemed themselves to be unsuited. In the princely states, slaves, especially Africans, served primarily as domestics concubines, eunuchs, water carriers, barbers, personal guards, stableboys, etc. We are informed that the king of Oudh (in what is now Uttar Pradesh) was supplied in the early nineteenth century with many Ethiopian male and female slaves and paid princely sums for them. Upon purchase they were all converted to Islam. We are also told that 'the rich and aristocratic Muslims, especially those who lived in cities like Patna and Calcutta, used to own besides male and female slaves, a large number of Habshi [Ethiopian] eunuchs'.$^{18}$ As in earlier periods, African slaves were considered to be luxury and prestige commodities.

As Vellut has argued, instead of the state-stateless dichotomy, we should think of two modes of power structures: the hierarchical, well-defined order based on the payment of tribute which was that of the kingdoms; and, at the other extreme, the more egalitarian and informal type of government by councils of elders and notables."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.499, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate and Borno', 'section_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80 > Social structure', 'content': ""Women slaves could marry other slaves, and their children tended to become part of their owner's household, though still of slave status.

Consequently a number of amirs were sons of concubines: indeed a concubine mother was seen to be a necessary qualification for a 'real' amir, presumably because the amir could not be influenced by maternal kin. Islamic law also does not recognize the common West African distinction between slaves born in captivity and those born free, by which the former, as children of slaves, were not normally sold away from their natal home. Although in certain areas or amongst certain classes the distinction remained valid (the Hausa term, cucenama, is the same as that used in Borno and Fezzän where it is equivalent to Haratin), the only formal ban the reformers of the djihad appear to have recognized was on the export of these Muslim slaves, particularly to Christian states. That is, the slaves were by birth members not of a particular lineage but of Muslim society. But the change also implies that slaves had become more marketable and so more widely distributed.\nSlaves did not pay tax. But like sons or wives working in gandu (that is, for the head of their household), alongside whom slaves usually worked, they contributed about three-quarters of their working time to their owner; but unlike sons, they could not expect to inherit and become in their turn the head of a household - they were forever 'sons'; in slave villages, owned either by the state or by families, slaves had their own households and worked under their headman; superficially such settlements were no differ› ent from free villages."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.527, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic tensions > Social change', 'content': ""Artisans were denied the rights enjoyed by freemen and nobles, and were reduced to endogamy.

He was also a mediator in conflicts between individuals and families. However, there was no shortage of subjects of tension. 59 In the Mossi kingdom of Wagadugu, slaves were made into eunuchs in sufficiently large numbers for it to be feasible to export them northward. In Asante, the quantity of human livestock obtained by the payment of tribute was so great that when the slave trade was abolished, the Asantehene stated that he could not feed the 20 000 captives whom he had on his hands, adding, 'unless I kill or sell them, they will grow strong and kill my people'. 60 It appears, however, that social relations between slaves and their owners were marked by less hostility in societies not having a central power structure. We are told that in the village of Pura, slaves were fed 'just like everyone else'. M. PŁre tells us that in the Lobi country, each submatriclan was divided into two groups: the true-born Weya, and the Dea, who were of captive origin. The latter category included people who had been adopted because they had been found at the door one morning, seeking refuge from famine or raiding. Both categories, however, were fully integrated within the social structure as sources of production and progeny. Accordingly, a slave lived in the same hut as his master, whom he addressed as 'father'; he was a member of the same kin group as the latter and was subject to the same rituals and taboos and engaged in the same work; his owner gave him a wife, he possessed a field, and was entitled to accumulate cowries to the point of buying his freedom or purchasing another man to replace him.

There are male Ocrahs, and there are also female Ocrahs, the latter more properly called Crabahs. They are to be found, not only in the palaces of kings, but in the household of anybody and everybody who is wealthy enough or foolish enough to purchase a slave for the purpose. The Ocrah may sometimes be the friend of his master, and the Crabah of her mistress, but is not by any means necessarily so. The probability is, that he does possess the confidence of his master, and she of her mistress, for neither would have been selected had they not evinced, whilst young, unusual capabilities for the performance of the ordinary domestic duties attached to their office. The number of Ocrahs and Crabahs in one household vary according to the wealth or the folly of the master or mistress.

If the vessel must move before such opportunity occurs, they are sold to a dealer, who buys cheaper than the retail purchasers. My friend told me that he had a number of black slaves, but said he had allowed them to marry, and had given them free papers, that their service with him was voluntary, and in the event of his death they would be safe from the claims of heirs and creditors. It is common for Egyptians, who know that almost all Christendom opposes the institution, to make such apologies to frank acquaintances, but in this case I believe the statement was correct.\n\n""This conversation increased my curiosity and strengthened my determination to see the Cairo slave-pen if possible. To accomplish my purpose I made application to another native friend. He said, \'No, I am too well known, but I will lend you my coat, and you will pass as a Levantine, and there is a young man here can show you. That coat of yours looks too English.\' We exchanged coats. The young man and I mounted donkeys, and in ten minutes we had left the Frank quarter and were winding our way through the narrow, crooked, and dirty streets of a thoroughly Arab neighbourhood. Suddenly my companion called a halt, and said one of the buildings we had just passed was sometimes used for a pen, and he would inquire if they had a stock at present. He came to me in a minute, and told me that if the dealer pressed any one of his women on me, I must object that they were too old; that my wife wanted a girl young enough to be trained to take intelligent care of the children.

The textbook provides a nuanced view of the cultural and social dynamics during the colonial period, highlighting the coexistence and blending of indigenous and European influences across the continent. It discusses the survival and adaptation of African cultural forms alongside European innovations, as seen in the Igbo's simultaneous embrace of both traditional and Western practices, and emphasizes the diversity of African responses to colonialism shaped by various ethno-cultural and socio-economic factors. However, it does not specifically mention colonial Accra or the presence of European and African names among contributors there, focusing instead on broader cultural interactions. In contrast, The African Times articles provide specific details supporting the claim in the context of colonial Accra. They highlight the presence of both European and African contributors, such as William M'Arthur and George Gladstone from London, alongside local figures like Captain Edmunds, W. G. Bruce, and Henry Baddoo from Accra, suggesting interaction and cooperation between Europeans and Africans. The articles also describe Accra as a place where white and black individuals coexisted more harmoniously than in other parts of Western Africa, indicating a unique social dynamic. However, they note changes over time, such as a shift in the European demographic, which may have affected these dynamics, and discuss challenges faced by the local population, including the influence of European traders and officials on social practices and the need for educational and moral development.

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure. The point is that colonial Africans were probably not unaware of the elementary fact that accepting \'new forms [would] increase the range of alternatives\'$^{3}$ available to them.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The structure of Volume VII', 'content': 'Finally, only those historians who are really ignorant of or hold very simplistic views about the political and ethno-cultural situation in Africa on the eve of the European partition and conquest would use that term.

But no African country or colony or empire was made up of any such single ethnic group. Each country or empire was populated by numerous ethno-cultural groups or nations who were as different from each other as, say, the Italians are from the Germans or the French. More› over, prior to the arrival of the European invaders, relations between these different groups were often hostile while some might even have been sub› jugated by others. To label such subjugated or hostile groups who chose to join the invading European group against their former foreign enemies or rulers as collaborators is to miss the point. Indeed, as will be demon› strated in some of the chapters of this volume, the nature of African reactions and responses to colonialism was determined not only by the ethno-cultural and political situation with which the Africans were con› fronted but also by the very nature of the socio-economic forces at work in the particular society at the time of the confrontation, and the nature of its political organization.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading.

In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

The themes of African redemption through American black missionaries were another.\nAfricans themselves, however, created the context of their next interaction with American blacks as they matriculated at American, largely Afro-American, schools and attended pan-African conferences and the like. Consequently, many Africans underwent a technical-educationalpolitical experience alien to their colonial world. When they re-entered their own worlds, many felt driven to resolve questions of ideology, cultural definition, educational values, political power, and pan-African unity or consciousness, guided by new perspectives.\nViewed against such an historical backdrop, the numerous pan-African conferences, Tuskegean educational and technical projects, the nØgritude movement and the occasional focus on American blacks in African millen› nial dreams, all illustrate the consistency of the pan-African theme among American and Caribbean blacks.

Another reflected the transformation of Africans from predicate to subject during the colonial period.

Consequently, through the media of numerous international conferences, visitations, and technical missions, many Africans were touched by the 'Tuskegee Spirit' or drew upon Tuskegee's and other American black resources."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': 'Literary culture in the Western Sudan', 'content': ""We have already commented on some devices employed by the 'autoch› thones' against the mechanisms of cultural negation employed by European colonialism; the Islamic culture, in the proselytizing polity of the Dyula, was to encounter the same resistance.

There may be many ways of accounting for this, but no doubt it must be ascribed chiefly to the fact that from time immemorial the white men who came to sojourn at Accra, whether Danes, Dutch, or English, were almost invariably of a superior class.\n\nTimes are, however, changed; the English gentleman is not now so frequently met with here as in days of yore.\n\nIn those days the white man lived in harmony with the black man. Being a gentleman, he did not consider himself degraded by associating on terms of perfect equality with the coloured man whose education, intellectual attainments, and self-respect entitled him to the respect of those whose esteem is of any value.\n\nHaving in view why exact English gentlemen deem qualifications, sufficient to entitle the Frenchman, the Turk, the American, Indian, or the Ashantee to move in their society, and having that feeling which pervades all real gentlemen, those white men, when they encountered black men possessing intellectual abilities and other qualifications not inferior to their own, were only too ready to receive them into their society, and too glad to be admitted into that of the natives. The European being a man of education and good breeding felt quite as much at ease in the society of the educated black man as in that of his brethren at home; he knew that his companion, though black, yet for all that, was a gentleman; and that was quite sufficient for him, and vice versa.\n\nNow-a-days, things are not exactly the same. The white men of the ancient type certainly do visit this country and sojourn for a period, but they do not, as of old, make it their home. They make their money and are off again whence they came, or if they be Government officials their term of service expires and away they depart.\n\nThe English gentleman has been to a certain extent superseded by the English Gent, a distinct class too well known and too well described and caricatured by their own countrymen, to render a description necessary here.\n\nThese men, whom the rage for the rapid acquisition of wealth has induced to visit our parts, or others to send them here to acquire wealth for them, arrive imbued with ideas common to all ignorant men—that is to say, if beings whose minds have such a limited scope can be said to have any ideas of their own at all, and not picked up second-hand from others only a shade less ignorant than themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1866#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.637, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Roll of African Worthies', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Our heart swells with exultation whenever we are able to point to a name to be inscribed on the historical roll of African worthies.

Up till 1876 Cape Coast Castle enjoyed that honour, but in that year the head-quarters of the Government were moved to this place. The change would have been inadvisable on other than sanitary grounds, as there is not the least protection here against the surf which breaks along the shore, at some seasons rendering landing impracticable, and at all times dangerous. Once ashore, Accra presents pleasanter features and surroundings than are to be found in any of the other towns of the Gold Coast Colony. The town is much more scattered than that of Cape Coast Castle. It is built on the top of a red cliff, some 60 feet high, overlooking the sea. Formerly there were three Accras, British and Dutch, adjoining each other, which now form one town, and Danish two miles east. The latter still retains its Danish appellation, Christiansborg. British Accra is the oldest English possession on the West Coast, having been owned by us for upwards of two hundred years. The Danes do not seem to have left their mark on the place to any extent, either as regards language, manners, or customs, whereas the Dutch have left traces of their rule here in the number of half-castes with Dutch names, and also in the language spoken by the natives. Fantee is, of course, the language spoken by the natives, but it is a good deal corrupted by the addition of English and Dutch words. The language, to the ear unaccustomed to it, sounds uncouth and unmusical, and utterly devoid of that rhythm which Oriental languages possess, and which is so attractive to the untutored ear. The people here appear to be a similar race to the Ashantees. In fact, there is such constant intercourse going on between the Ashantee country and Accra that a large number of the inhabitants of this place are Ashantees. There are no troops here, merely a large force of Houssas, but their services are not much in request, as the people are very law-abiding. There is a considerable trade between Accra and the interior, and a large amount of gold dust is brought down and exported to England. The greatest care is requisite in purchasing this, and European merchants find it necessary to employ native assayers to prevent fraud on the part of the sellers. Some of the native jewellers here turn out fairly good workmanship in the shape of rings, necklaces, bracelets, &c.; they always manufacture from 22-carat gold, and their workmanship is consequently extremely soft. There are very few European merchants here—not more than three or four at present. Their number seems to have been diminishing of late years, and appears to be likely still further to decrease. The firms at home find that they can get their business out here equally well transacted by educated natives at less cost, so that the latter are gradually absorbing all the agencies for English houses. The white man cannot compete with the negro in his own country, when the latter is of average intelligence, fairly educated, and sufficiently cute; and from the progress made by the upper class of natives, it appears that the large firms in England will in a few years' time be glad to act as agents for the native merchants, instead of the latter transacting that office for them. A plentiful and constant supply of labour is the great difficulty this colony has to contend with—not that there is any lack of materials at hand, but the negro will not work as long as he can exist without it, and in a climate like this, existence becomes practicable on a very small amount of labour. The consequence is, that the adult male population of the Gold Coast Colony add little to the riches or produce of the country. Most of the work that is done is performed by the female portion of the community, while their husbands sit at ease and complacently view their wives and daughters labouring while they eat the bread of idleness. All the Europeans are agreed that the only hope for the future is a system of forced labour which, compelling able-bodied natives to work for fair remuneration, will take steps to guard this measure against the risk of abuse. In a very short period the increased wealth of the colony would demonstrate the benefits of such a measure, whilst the increased improvement in the condition of the natives would lead them to see that forced labour was advantageous to them and to the colony."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1885#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'REVIEW.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As we have often exposed European misconduct in these countries, we may be allowed to quote F.R.G.S. on the same subject: ""There are about 100 Europeans in the land; amongst these there are many excellent fellows, but—it is an unpleasant confession to make—the others appear to me inferior to the Africans, native as well as mulatto.

May I ask, do these scholars patronize civilization and colonization as Lagos and Sierra Leone did? I answer, they do not; because they will not point out or will not speak to the authorities or in the public papers of the great obstacle (foolish heathenish customs, custom for deaths, fetish dancing in public streets, &c.), which prevents the progress of the inhabitants in civilization. If the educated natives do really know what civilization and colonization are, they should help the authorities to root up heathenish and foolish customs, the only canker which destroys the promising tree.\n\nThere are certain fetish men and women at Accra whose constant duty from time to time, and up to the present date, is to peep into every individual house and amongst every individual family for women who departed this life in the struggle of childbirth.

The Phoenicians treated the part of Africa which they colonised as the British would, as the foundation of trade and commerce. The Phoenicians were followed, about 650 B.C., by the Greeks, who founded their first African colony Cyrene, on the coast of Tripoli. Then came the Carthaginians. They and the Greeks carried on a busy commerce all along the Mediterranean coast, far down to the Atlantic coast, to the mouth of the Red Sea. These were followed by the Romans, who continued an active career on the African coast until the decay of the Roman Empire.\n\nMr. Scott Keltie showed how little was known of the interior of Africa up to 150 A.D. by Ptolemy\'s map being thrown on to the sheet in the darkened theatre. This map, which was filled up haphazard fashion, gathered up, the lecturer said, all the knowledge of the continent which had accumulated during this long period of commercial activity — a knowledge which amounted to very little beyond the coasts and the Nile Valley. The next important period dealt with was the period of Arab invasion and the spread of the tenets of Mohammedanism — namely, from the seventh to the fifteenth century. In the early part of the fifteenth century commenced the ""glorious"" period of Portuguese activity, which lasted for some sixty years, during which the contour of the coast of Africa was completely laid down. This began the real modern partition of Africa, and the lecturer dwelt upon the effect which could be traced to Portuguese occupation of African territory — that occupation being marked by ruin rather than by enterprise. He rapidly traced the occupation of points of territory by Portuguese, Spanish, French, English, Dutch, Danish, and Germans, whose commerce was in ivory and slaves. He held that the opening up of the continent of Africa might be said to have begun with Bruce\'s travels in Abyssinia in the latter part of the eighteenth century. From that time until 1850 nearly the whole map of Africa became gradually filled up, and from 1850 down to the present day the southern half of the continent had received increasing attention at the hands of explorers until it also had had its main features laid down.

According to Logan, the pre-Aryan civilisation of Southern India had a partially Egyptian character. The oldest races, he asserts, were of a variable African type which spoke languages allied to the African. Egypt, and not India, is the common cradle of all we have in common, east, west, north, and south, all round the world. The languages, beliefs, rites, laws and customs went out to India, but did not return thence by means of the apocryphal Aryan migrations.

Since these remarkable people—probably the origin of the stories of pigmies told by the Greek poets—were discovered in the Monbutto country, to the west of the Albert Nyanza, by the German traveller, Schweinfurth, in 1870, they have received considerable attention from various anthropologists, and descriptions and measurements of several living individuals have been published; but hitherto no account of their anatomical character has been given. The skeletons obtained by Emin Pasha are the first that have been sent to Europe, and are, therefore, of great interest, especially as they fully confirm all that has been said of the diminutive size of these people, and prove them to be the smallest on the earth, smaller even than the natives of the Andaman Islands or the Bushmen of South Africa. These two skeletons, though both of fully-grown people, are scarcely four English feet high, and a woman of the race, carefully measured by Emin Pasha, was still shorter. They are well formed, and present most of the characteristics of the negro race, except that the skull is rather rounder in shape than is usual. With respect to this character, it has been long ago pointed out by the French anthropologist, Hamy, that in Equatorial Africa, extending from the West Coast far into the interior, are scattered tribes interspersed among the more ordinary negro population, and distinguished from them by this form of head and by their diminutive stature. They appear to constitute a distinct branch of the great negro race to which the name of ""Negrillo"" has been applied, and seem to bear the same relationship to their better-grown neighbours as the small ""Negritos"" of the Indian Archipelago do to the larger Melanesians or oceanic negros of the same regions.

Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.606, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and jingoism to hear it."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in the face of partition and conquest', 'section_title': 'The ideology of resistance', 'content': ""Colonial apologists stressed the irrationality and desperation of armed resistance.

The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ...

Taking a bird's-eye view of the whole situation in time and space, so that each factor might assume its proper relative position and proportion, he unhesitatingly affirmed in the plainest language that so far their intercourse with African races, instead of being a blessing, had been little better than an unmitigated curse to them.

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs. It shows nice powers of observation—great diligence—a clear appreciation of facts, and a mental daring that does not shrink from the great problems of the future of the various divisions of his race, on which the light of Christian civilisation is only now beginning to shine, and who are for the most part placed under circumstances most unfavourable to its increase. After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries. Showing us their actual condition, and exposing many errors of administration which are opposed to material development and social advancement, he views the whole in connexion with the resolutions of the late House of Commons Committee, 1865, recommending the preparing of the several people for self-government. He shows the great changes that must be induced and fostered to make such self-government possible, safe, or beneficial. Though he has evidently a deep and, we believe, a just faith in his race, he does not shut his eyes to any of the disadvantages of their actual position and the difficulties in the way of their progress toward Christianity, civilisation, and wealth.

Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best.

The great future wealth of the interior plateaux will certainly lie in their mineral deposits, the riches of the West Coast region lie in its numerous and valuable vegetable products, of which the most striking are palm oil, and ground nuts, benniseed, shea butter, rubber, gums, spices, cotton, dyes, and valuable timbers, among which ebony occupies a prominent place. With regard to animal products, I might mention ivory and monkey skins. Whereas some of the great races of the interior speak languages which connect them with the Hamitic and Semitic families. The native inhabitants of the West Coast are all that there is of most typically Negro in character; yet I do not mean they are races of particularly low development; on the contrary, the typical Negro is a fine specimen of man, and is by no means as low in his mental state as the races of Polynesia and America. I may cite the Kru tribes of that portion of West Africa which is known as Liberia, a country inhabited by an industrious, energetic, hardworking, stalwart population of free men. An element of heterogeneous ex-slave settlers among the tribes of the coast may be found in some parts of the Colonies of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos. These people represent the Nemesis which invariably follows national crimes. We and our American children indulged to a greater extent than any other European nation in the African slave trade, and, as our wrong-doing was violent and exaggerated, so to a certain extent was the abrupt reparation which followed. Although I would not minimise the work done by our blockade on the West Coast, the abolition of the slave trade was more effectually brought about by the abolition of slavery in the United States of America. One result of our suppression of the slave trade in West Africa has not been altogether advantageous. I refer to the Slave Colonies established at Sierra Leone, and at Fernando Po and other points on the coast. It may be taken that the slaves exported from any district are the least worthy people in it, and the result is that a large proportion of this population is descended from the sweepings of West Africa, and has not yet passed through sufficient generations to eliminate the ancestral badness of its progenitors. So, although here and there a negro has shown what the race can attain to under favourable circumstances, still the bulk of the ""S\'a Leone"" people who are scattered up and down the coast are of an undesirable character, and the cause of indiscriminating blame on the part of superficial observers which is most unjustly laid on the shoulders of the entire population of West Africa; whereas many of these races are superior in intelligence, enterprise, and integrity to any of our negro fellow-subjects in South Africa or the West Indies. What admirable recruits to civilised society can be obtained from many of these people may be instanced by such men as Bishop Crowther, Archdeacons Johnson and Crowther, Samuel Lewis, and other divines and lawyers and officials in West Africa, who are on a par with well-educated white men, and in some cases superior in intelligence and acquirements to the whites with whom they come in contact. It is absurd, however, to regard the Negro race, as a whole, on the same average level as the European—they are far below us. Take them in their native wilds, and they are what we were before Julius Caesar landed in this country; indeed, in many cases they are not 2,000 years behind us, but 10,000. They are in the condition of some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and Gaul, and Spain, whose history we can dimly spell out from their implements and scattered remains, who were undoubtedly cannibals and probably naked, and leading a brutish life. Yet we can in a few years drag them from the condition that prevailed 2,000 years before Christ into the year of grace 1889. We can take a cannibal from the Upper Cross River, and transport him to the centres of civilisation in England or America, where everything represents the utmost result of our present development; but what will be usually the result both with the individual and the race? The savage mind will be unable to grasp and assimilate one-third of the wonders presented to his consideration, and will probably even suffer from the shock. We cannot expect the negroes of West Africa to become all at once intelligent, self-governing people. For many years the white races must be their guardians and educators, and we must educate the negro by force if necessary, leaving him to understand us afterwards, when we have raised him to a condition to do so. This, then, is our mission in West Africa: to instruct the natives that idleness is the eighth deadly sin; next, to so instruct the native as to the existence of the resources of this country; and, lastly, to educate him in the principles of civilised society, and so assimilate his views with our own that he and we may be bound together with the ties of commerce and Empire.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.614, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'REVIEW.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Books are like men.

Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A common pattern of the movement of cultural forms and their concrete manifestations, the incident provides an apt model of survival, even renewal of cultural values in the face of religious and other more socially intensive forms of domination.

The slave trade had intensified internecine warfare for over two centuries, leading to cultural devastation on an unprecedented scale. Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent. Different methods of foreign control or interaction with the African populace naturally evoked or created different cultural responses from the displaced African. Belgian and Portuguese colonialism, as well as British settler colonialism in East Africa, are easily recognized as the most ruthless on the continent. They created conditions for the truly displaced African in the most literal sense of the word.

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

Does it constitute a break with Africa's past or was it just a mere episode in its history, an episode which is of limited importance and which did not affect the course of African development? Here again, conflicting answers have been given to this question. To some historians, indeed a very large number, including the Marxist and the development and anti-development theorists but for very different reasons, though colonialism was a short interlude, it nevertheless was of great significance for Africa and left an indelible impression on Africa. As R. Oliver and N. Atmore contend: 'Measured on the time-scale of history, the colonial period was but an interlude of comparatively short duration. But it was an interlude that radically changed the direction and momentum of African history.'$^{50}$ Gann and Duignan also regard the colonial era 'as most decisive for the future of Africa'.$^{51}$ The answer of the Marxists and the underdevelopment theorists is neatly summed up in the title of Rodney's book, namely, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa. On the other hand, there are others who regard the colonial impact as skin-deep and that colonialism did not con› stitute any break with the African past. In a series of publications, 52 J. F. A. Ajayi has consistently maintained that the impact of colonialism on Africa has been exaggerated, that colonialism 'represents only an episode in a long and eventful history', and did not cause any break in continuity, that Africans retained some control over their own destinies and 'to the extent to which Africans retained initiative, the ability of Europeans to make entirely new departures in African history was limited'. Hopkins has also maintained that the 'colonial era has ceased to be regarded as the sole substance of African history and there are sound reasons for thinking that colonial rule itself had a less dramatic and a less pervasive economic impact than was once supposed'. He has insisted that colonial› ism did 'not create modernity out of backwardness by suddenly disrupting a traditional state of low-level equilibrium' and that 'the main function of the new rulers was to give impetus to a process of economic development which was already under way'. 53 To this author, there is really no simple yes or no answer to this question since the impact of colonialism"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.605, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""By 1935, as is evident from the earlier chapters of this volume, colonialism had been firmly fastened on Africa like a steel grid, and it looked as if it was going to remain there forever. However, colonialism proved just as ephemeral as any other institution created and maintained by force. Within a matter of only some forty-five years from 1935, the colonial system had been uprooted from over 90% of Africa and confined only to that part of the continent south of the Limpopo River. That is to say, colonial› ism lasted in most parts of Africa for under a hundred years, indeed from the 1880s to the 1960s. In the history of a people and a whole continent, this is a very brief span indeed. How and why this incredible feat of the uprooting of colonialism was accomplished, or, to quote the words of Margery Perham, why this 'astonishingly rapid emancipation since 1950' ' form two of the main themes of the concluding volume of this History. In the concluding chapter of this volume, however, we would like to address ourselves to two main questions. First, what legacies did colonialism bequeath to Africa, or what impact did it make on Africa? The second question is, in view of this impact or balance sheet, what is the significance of colonialism for Africa? Does it constitute a revolutionary or important episode in the history of the continent? Was it a major break with the past of the continent, or was it, after all, a mere passing event which did not constitute a break in the history of the continent? Or as L. H.

This neither they nor we can easily discard.'$^{4}$ It is interesting to note that another English historian, D. K. Fieldhouse, has arrived at the same con› clusion in a book published as recently as 1981: 'It would thus appear that colonialism deserves neither the praise nor the blame it has often been given for, if it did relatively little to overcome the causes of poverty in the colonies, neither did it make them poor for the first time. Empire had very significant economic effects, some good, some bad .. .' 5 Finally, Gann and Duignan, who have devoted themselves virtually to the defence of colonialism in Africa, concluded in 1967 that 'the imperial system stands out as one of the most powerful engines for cultural diffusion in the history of Africa; its credit balance by far outweighs its debit account'.$^{6}$ And in their introduction to the first volume of the five-volume work entitled Colonialism in Africa which they jointly edited, they again concluded: 'We do not share the widely-held assumption that equates colonialism with exploitation ... We accordingly interpret European im› perialism in Africa as an engine of cultural transformation as well as of political domination.' 7 Others, mainly African, black and Marxist scholars and especially the development and underdevelopment theorists, have contended that the beneficial effect of colonialism in Africa was virtually nil. The black Guyanese historian, Walter Rodney, has taken a particularly extreme position. As he contends: 'The argument suggests that, on the one hand, there was exploitation and oppression, but, on the other hand, colonial governments did much for the benefit of Africans and they developed Africa. It is our contention that this is completely false. Colonialism had only one hand - it was a one-armed bandit.' 8 Such are the two main opposing assessments of colonialism in Africa.

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs.

After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries. Showing us their actual condition, and exposing many errors of administration which are opposed to material development and social advancement, he views the whole in connexion with the resolutions of the late House of Commons Committee, 1865, recommending the preparing of the several people for self-government. He shows the great changes that must be induced and fostered to make such self-government possible, safe, or beneficial. Though he has evidently a deep and, we believe, a just faith in his race, he does not shut his eyes to any of the disadvantages of their actual position and the difficulties in the way of their progress toward Christianity, civilisation, and wealth.

There is a map in the Vatican, 300 years old, which gives the general physical relief and the river and lake systems of Africa with more or less accuracy; but the Arab geographers of a century before had described the mountain system, the great lakes, and the course of the Nile.

Neither Egyptian, Carthaginian, Persian, or Roman influence was allowed to establish itself on that continent. It would seem that no solution of the African problem was to come from alien sources.

Apt to learn, quick to understand and to appreciate advantages, they are a people easy to assume and appropriate the best results of civilization—brave in the defence of their rights and homes, yet not aggressive, except when forced by circumstances and their teachings.

A people educated by so long a course of schooling in its vicissitudes might well be cruel and vicious. The land has been hunted, from Egypt to the Cape of Good Hope, by foreign and native stealers. Tribes have been driven for self-protection, or by greed of gain, to make captures from other tribes or other parts of their own. To show the debasing power of slavery and slave-hunting, let me say that I have seen slaves brought to the coast from the central parts of Africa who were the most abject specimens of the human race I have ever known—brought by a strong, stalwart tribe, noble in bearing, and brave in war; and these, too, were the same tribe or people only a comparatively short time before. Why this great difference? A simple explanation is only required to show it all. Together and at peace, they had a generous and varied diet of animal and vegetable food, for they had extent of territory in which to hunt and gather; but divided and at war, fighting for self-protection, one party gained the supremacy. Then the other were a defeated people; circumscribed within small limits, unable to hunt, they were soon confined to vegetable diet alone, and then to a single kind, and often to a few simple roots; courage gone, they were reduced to servitude and slavery, and brought to a market.

It is an admirable volume for all who desire general information respecting that great continent, into the dense darkness of which the light of civilization and Christianity has begun to penetrate, through the devoted exertions of missionaries and scientific explorers.

So many active agencies are now at work in and for Africa that some more intimate knowledge of it must be desired; while yet the labour of wading through long and dreary books of African travel, with their sadly monotonous succession of pictures of sparsely-inhabited countries, and of ignorance, suffering, cruelty, and moral degradation everywhere, deters most people from seeking it in their pages.

Liberia has been a black republic for forty years; Sierra Leone has been a negro colony for a century; and it cannot be denied that each of these communities has made very gratifying progress. Yet, upon Dr. Blyden's own showing, that progress has been but partial, he still has to complain of his countrymen's imitativeness and lack of backbone. The responsibility for this, undoubtedly, rests to some extent upon the unsuitable character of the education which the civilized negroes have received; but it is more to the purpose to remember that three generations is a very brief period in the development of a pagan people. How slow the work of civilization in Liberia has been may be seen from the fact that, whereas there are some twenty thousand Christian negroes in the republic, there are more than a million who are pagans. And now we inevitably come to the primary question of all: whether or not the presumed racial inferiority of the negro is proved. Dr. Blyden pleads eloquently for his fellows, and triumphantly asks: How could an inferior race have produced Toussaint L'Ouverture? The question is not unnatural, but it is far from logical. The matter, as it fashions itself to us, is, and is likely to remain for a long time to come, an open one. The negro has, as yet, enjoyed no sufficient opportunity of proving either his mental equality with or his inferiority to the white. The experience of Sierra Leone and Liberia, so far as it has gone, has been in his favour; what we know of his moral history in that other black republic, Hayti, and in the United States, is at the best negative. As time goes on, the question, which is far more momentous than would appear to the unthinking, will settle itself. Emigration from America to Liberia, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, is proceeding satisfactorily; and Dr. Blyden states that 200,000 negroes in the United States are prepared to return to the land of their fathers. But colonization by private effort is, at the best, exceedingly slow; and in this instance it is perhaps well that it is so, since the gradual settlement of Liberia is far more likely to provide material for a strong and healthy State than a hasty rush would be. Social reformers for many a year to come will watch the experiment, as they have watched it in the past, with keen interest. The chief danger lies, as Dr. Blyden constantly points out, in the tendency to Europeanize the negro—to supersede customs and practices which are useful and often necessary in Africa by customs utterly out of place there. The ill-directed zeal of some of the less reflective missionaries has, no doubt, been to blame for some of this; but there is, we fancy, very little to complain of upon this head now. Let it be once proved beyond all doubt that negroes can found flourishing colonies, can develop the limitless resources of the continent which has been the cradle of their race; and, above all, that they can govern themselves prudently and self-reliantly,—and there will open up before the black man the assurance of a future as splendid and far-reaching as any that ever presented itself to a white conqueror."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1887#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.589, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'REVIEW.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As we have often exposed European misconduct in these countries, we may be allowed to quote F.R.G.S. on the same subject: ""There are about 100 Europeans in the land; amongst these there are many excellent fellows, but—it is an unpleasant confession to make—the others appear to me inferior to the Africans, native as well as mulatto.

Hence, champions of African nationalism in the inter-war period (wanasiasa as they are known in Swahili) have been referred to as being primarily panAfricanists rather than nationalists in the European sense. The point was that nationalism was taking a reverse course to the expression of the same phenomenon in Europe. Contrary to what happened in Europe, the state was created before the cultural nations that would make it a meaningful political community were welded together. It is in this sense that one should take James Coleman's observation that: ... the drive behind African nationalism in many instances is not the consciousness of belonging to a distinct politico-cultural unit which is seeking to protect or assert itself, but rather it is the movement of racially-conscious modernists seeking to create new political and cultural nationalities out of the heterogenous people within the artificial boundaries imposed by the European master ... '\nWe must recognize that colonialism, as a system of relations, rests upon some kind of racialism, and that since development in a colonial situation is a product of interactions between the colonizer and the colonized, racial consciousness is basic to the growth of nationalism as a search for sovereignty and independence.\nThat African nationalists are regarded as 'modernists' is a reflection of the fact that they were operating within an externally defined setting which imposed alien systems of values, norms, and definitions of political and social developments to which they had to subscribe as a condition for success. That nationalism in Africa is a dynamic, ongoing phenomenon is clear from the extensive literature on themes like nation-building and irredentism.

The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history.

The emergent labour force gradually became unionized in many colonies and added momentum to the expression of African nationalism through anti-colonial politics. As labour in the colonies exhibited all the malaise of a colonial situation, especially harsh exploitation based on racial discrimination and social injustice, labour relations automatically became political relations which were antagonistic as between the citizens of the colonizing country and the colonized Africans. The role of labour in the politics of African nationalism was to become very important from the Second World War onwards. 7\nThe role of the different official ideologies enunciated by the colonial powers was another determinant. As John Peel says 'An ideology, like the ideals of the great religions, is a factor shaping behaviour even when uncompletely realised ...' and 'Development does not occur apart from men's interpretation of their situation and ideas for their future.'$^{8}$ The differences in the orientation and style of African nationalists derived in part from the fact that the various groups had different ideologies to guide their expectations and by which to assess their achievements. Hence, among African nationalists under French control in Algeria and Senegal, where the possibility of ending colonialism through the policy of'assimila› tion' - by the attainment of French citizenship for individuals with full rights and responsibilities - had been demonstrated, the tendency was to continue to press for the extension, in scope and territorially, of the implementation of the policy. On the other hand, those in British territories, with the hope of eventual independence as separate sovereign countries, though as members of the British Commonwealth, were understandably more explicitly concerned during the period under consideration with reforms and participation which would prepare them ultimately for independence. The difference was not as to the objective of freedom, which they all wanted, but rather as to method.

The development of the intelligentsia was determined by the specific character of European colonization and relative access to education. The social 'ceiling' for Africans in the south was far lower than in West Africa where, in the absence of a permanent body of white settlers, Africans found it easier to become clerks or secure a job in the civil service. In Southern Africa, whites had monopolized all the employment opportunities that might have been open to educated Africans, be they in the administration, the economic sector, the church or other spheres of life.\nBy the same token, the intelligentsia in Southern Africa was from its inception closer to the people. This was due to the fact that, in these regions, it derived from the midst of the indigenous population and was not initially recruited, as was sometimes the case in some West African countries, from repatriated 'freed' slaves or their descendants. The regime of cruel race discrimination, of which Africans in Southern Africa were victims without exception, inevitably tended to bring the intelligentsia closer to the people. African intellectuals there found it more difficult to play the role of inter› mediaries.\nAnother crucial distinguishing feature of anti-colonial protest in Southern Africa lies in the fact that opposition to the colonial order was recruited, not only from among Africans, but from among the sizeable non-African populations - the 'coloured people', Indians and progressive whites.

In Angola and Zambezi and Katanga (by the turn of the century) recruiting agents from the mines of the south were competing with agents from the Portuguese forced labour plantations in the Bight of Benin. 45 Just as the first Scramble for territory and sovereignty was resisted so was this second Scramble for labour. It was resisted in arms, and much of the support given to the great revolts of the early twentieth century which tried to redefine sovereignty came from men who hated forced labour. It was also resisted by desertion and strikes, by refusal to work underground, by compound riots.

Conversely, the variety of goods obtainable at the retail markets were increasingly of foreign origin. Local artisanship suffered heavily from European competi› tion and manipulation, along lines already manifest in the pre-colonial period. As the colonial economy became firmly rooted in the 1920s, Africans were producing that which they did not consume and consuming that which they did not produce. In effect, domestic demand did not stimulate the maximization of domestic resources. As a further deleterious consequence, the colonizers wasted some African resources and ignored others, because their yardstick was the utility of the given resource to Europe rather than Africa. None of the major economic elements such as savings, investment, prices, incomes and output were correlated in response to domestic require› ments. For these structural reasons, recent research by African economists and historians has challenged the old formulations of colonial development and has posited instead that colonialism produced economic dependence, lopsidedness and underdevelopment. 14 The most significant event in the evolution of African economies in the inter-war period was the great depression of 1929-33.

Yet it has proved extremely difficult in practice to discuss resistance within this chronological limitation. At one extreme I have discussed Makana, the Xhosa prophet of the early nineteenth century. At the other extreme I have discussed the Zambezi rising of 1917 and its links with FRELIMO. But at least I have so far limited discussion to armed resistance to white invasion or to armed uprisings against colonial rule as it began to 'bite'; the chronological extensions arise from the uneven nature of white advance into Africa and from the still more uneven establish› ment of effective colonial control. Using this essentially political definition the period between 1880 and 1900 emerges as a crucial period of resistance, even if many of the great attempts to redefine sovereignty through protest took place later.\nIf we now turn in conclusion to the developing emphasis on economic resistance, the chronological limits become even less clearly defined. Perhaps the most radical reinterpretation is that of Samir Amin. Amin argues that the really crucial West African resistances to Europe came in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and he dismisses the resist› ances of the Scramble period itself as the half-hearted, rearguard actions of an already compromised ruling class. In Amin's eyes what was essentially at stake in the confrontation between Africa and Europe was not formal political control but Europe's attempts at economic manipulation. The truly significant African resistance was directed against such economic manipu› lation.\nAmin argues that the trade across the Sahara had 'strengthened state centralization and stimulated progress'. The European-controlled Atlantic trade, on the other hand, 'did not give rise to any productive forces: on the contrary, this caused a disintegration of society ... African societies obviously opposed this worsening of their situation, and Islam served as the basis for their resistance ...

Meebelo has called 'a popular revulsion against the ruling class', and where the aristocracy of Barotseland feared a slave uprising if they attempted to oppose the extension of British influence. ' 8 A number of historians, indeed, have stressed the importance of dis› criminating between resistances which were motivated by the desire of a ruling group to retain its exploitative power, and resistances on a much wider scale, which were often directed as much against the authoritarianism of African rulers as against colonial oppression. Edward Steinhart urges that protest and resistance can be and are directed ... against domestic forms of oppression ... Protest must be viewed as something other than the expression of national aspirations ... by focusing on leader› ship we have accepted the interpretation of anti-colonialism as 'African nationalism', a movement to expel aliens and to restore 'national' independence. If instead we look within the protest movements ... we are apt to discover that the impulses which the leaders organize and interpret are profoundly anti-authoritarian and revolutionary rather than anti-foreign and 'nationalist'. 19 Even where a long-established polity enjoyed a leadership with recog› nized legitimacy and was able to mobilize the majority of its population into resistance, recent historians have been inclined to criticize 'the narrow sense of primordial loyalty' and the 'parochialism' which did no more than to focus on sovereignty as previously understood. Such historians have emphasized instead the significance of those resistances in which the idea of sovereignty was redefined. Thus Isaacman argues that the 1917 revolt in the Zambezi valley was unlike previous resistances there, 'which were designed to regain the independence of a historical polity or a group of related peoples'. The 1917 revolt 'sought to liberate all the peoples of the Zambezi from colonial oppression', appealing especially to the oppressed peasantry of whatever ethnicity.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The significance of colonialism for Africa', 'content': ""and that 'the main function of the new rulers was to give impetus to a process of economic development which was already under way'. 53 To this author, there is really no simple yes or no answer to this question since the impact of colonialism varied from area to area and from theme to theme. There is no doubt that in the economic field, the colonial impact was by and large decisive and fundamental and affected both the rural and urban areas. In virtually all parts of Africa, the money economy had become the rule rather than the exception by the end of the colonial period and status even in the rural areas was being assessed not only in terms of birth and number of wives and children but also in terms of cash and the quantity of cash crops that one was producing each season. Further› more, with the introduction of cash crops, land assumed a value that it had not had in pre-colonial days while individual effort and achievement came to be regarded far more than the communalism of the traditional order. The African economy also became integrated deeper into the world economy in general and the capitalist economy in particular than before and this had effects that can probably never be undone. Unfortunately, this integration was effected in a very disadvantageous and exploitative manner for Africa and not even twenty years of independence have funda› mentally altered the situation which has now become known as neo› colonialism."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'Implications of incorporation', 'content': 'There is no need to exaggerate the role of external forces in African statebuilding.

Furthermore states were constructed in this same era which were quite remote from the world-economy as, for example, the Rozvi.$^{35}$ Also it is quite obvious, by looking at the West African states, that there is an imperfect connection between participation in the slave-trade and state-formation. If the two went hand to hand for Dahomey and Oyo, in Benin we had the formation of a strong state without such participation, and the inverse was true for the Niger delta. 36 The point, however, is a different one. It is that involvement in the world-economy required political structures that ensured the functioning of the economy; its commerce, its production, its labour-force supply.\nThe outside pressure was to have such structures.$^{37}$ Where the existing structures performed the necessary functions, for whatever reason, there was little pressure to change them. But, of course, the involvement in the world-economy increased the economic importance to given internal producers of sympathetic political structures. It is the internal producers who pressed to change the structures.$^{38}$ This led to various kinds of turmoil, which were of limited benefit to other participants in the world-economy. The latter in turn pressed for political stabilization, which took the form of creating states which participated in and were therefore constrained by the interstate system.$^{39}$ Ultimately, as we know, this led in most of Africa to the creation of colonial states. The abolition of the slave trade was a crucial political and economic event in this process. As plantation slavery and the slave trade were phenomena deriving from the operation of the capitalist world-economy, so was the abolition of the slave trade and of plantation slavery. I do not wish here to re-open the question of the importance of the abolitionists as a pressure group in this process. They of course existed and were part of the process.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...''

A grant of 10,000 acres, situated near a civilised centre, is required as a basis. The land will be divided into ten sections of 1,000 acres each; and, upon each of these divisions, ten carefully selected and well-trained families will be located. A sum of £25,000 will be required to enable the settlers to hold out for the first three years, while adjusting themselves to their new habitat, and to pay for the land should it be found necessary to purchase it.\n\nDuring this period each head of a family would receive sufficient food and clothing for himself and his household, but would not be entitled to any further remuneration. At the beginning of the fourth year, however, an additional allowance of £30 per annum would, in like manner, be given, as it is hoped that by that time an income would be obtained from the land under cultivation. This arrangement would continue until the close of the tenth year, when the land would become the property of the people. The net proceeds of their earnings during this said period would be employed in the spread of civilisation among the Natives, and in the assisting of other enterprising Africans who were desirous of returning and settling down in their Fatherland.\n\nThe £25,000 necessary to float the scheme is not required at present. It will be raised with the help of a Committee\n\nwhen the proper time arrives. I purpose, first of all, to go, spy out, and secure the land; secondly, to proceed to the West Indies to select the first 100 families as pioneers.\n\nTo meet this preliminary expense and charges already incurred in connexion with the maturing and developing of the scheme, a sum of not less than £650 is required. About £300 of this moderate amount has already been subscribed by more than 200 highly representative friends, and further contributions are earnestly solicited from all who take an interest in the progress of the African race.\n\nSubscriptions can be sent to the Treasurers—Edward P.

Now, what do the people of Sierra Leone mean by self-government? I believe I express the mind of my countrymen when I say that by self-government we simply desire some of those invaluable rights enjoyed by almost every community of British subjects—that is to say, to have the honour of saying nay or yes to those laws or rules of action by which our whole conduct as a people is guided, and most especially to have the privilege of managing, to some extent at least, our pecuniary affairs. In fact, Sir, the power of self-government for which we crave is but a shade better than what is termed in this country ""local,"" or ""parochial."" It is very far from our minds to diminish the power of the Council. Let them exercise their present authority to the fullest extent, and check any incursion we may dare to make into the laws through having power put into our hands. Nevertheless, Sir, we would pray and supplicate that Her Majesty\'s Government be pleased to grant and confer upon us an almost uncontrolled management of our ""local"" affairs. Without questioning for one moment the kind feelings of the honourable gentlemen of the Council of Sierra Leone, I contend that, from the very nature of their appointments, being liable to be removed from one place to another, it is impossible for them to take the same interest in the colony as the native inhabitants. It naturally becomes a matter of very little importance to them whether any material improvement takes place in the colony or not; having to leave it in a comparatively short time. The painful consequence of this is, that we see many important schemes which might be for the well-being of the inhabitants of Sierra Leone are left undone. Mr. Editor, need I remind you of the intelligence which is brought to us by almost every mail, of the havoc the various kinds of fever are making amongst the different classes of the inhabitants of the colony? Is it, Sir, I ask, that these gentlemen are not aware of the principal cause of all this mischief? Do they not know that all this evil arises from the total absence of drainage and general sanitary improvements in the colony? It is not possible to conceive this. In fact, I should consider it an insult to every individual concerned to charge them with ignorance with respect to this matter. And yet, Sir, we see these most material improvements untouched. And why so? The answer is what I have intimated: It is not natural to man to labour for the sole benefit and enjoyment of others. And who will deny that if some of the native gentlemen, who know that the probable lengthening or shortening of their days hangs upon the existence or non-existence of these improvements, had the power of carrying them out, they would use their utmost efforts to do so? I am sure, Sir, your readers will not understand me to be overlooking the overruling power of God. These remarks hold good for many other drawbacks in the colony. Dear Sir, ""No one knows where the shoe pinches, but he who wears it."" We know our wants and requirements (by we, I of course mean those of us who have had the privilege of knowing better), and I presume to say, that none are better judges as to the best mode of meeting these desiderata than ourselves.

For the development of their material resources, and consequently for their general progress, they have need of an element which does not exist per se, but must be created or imported. This element is wealth; and wealth is the realized surplus product of industry after the supply of the wants of those employed in it. In some British colonies a portion of the realized surplus in the mother country is brought in for stimulating development, either in the shape of resources belonging to immigrants, who may come in to occupy the lands, or Imperial expenditure, or moneys lent from England directly to colonists, upon security of their lands and houses, or through their Governments, on security of their general or particular resources, as revenues, colonial lands, &c. And the rapid development of some of those colonies has been greatly assisted by capital thus introduced. But the British possessions on the West Coast of Africa, not being available for British emigrants, have very little chance of the aid of British capital in any of the above ways, except, perhaps, as loans on the security of their revenues. For this, however, there must be a surplus revenue for payment of interest and redemption; and in advocating a wise economy in the Local Government expenditure, we have always had in view the creation of such a surplus of public revenue. We, then, look upon every act of official jobbery and extravagance by which the revenue is plundered and unnecessarily consumed, as being an attack upon the vital interests of the native population of those settlements. It is necessary to look the African financial question directly in the face. In the present and, so far as we can perceive, the prospective temperament of British politicians as regards West Africa, there is no chance of any Imperial expenditure there on those public works which are absolutely indispensable to a rapid development of material resources; no immigrants are likely to come in bringing realized capital with them; and it will be only after a large expenditure of capital that lands, even in British West African possessions, will be considered to offer such a security as to induce the loan of British capital upon them. From this it follows that if West Africa is to progress, it must be chiefly, if not entirely, by means of her own resources. In other words, there must be a creation of native capitalists. And the time has arrived at which this creation ought to take place. But it never can take place while the realized surplus product of industry goes out of the country. That realized surplus, which, in the infancy of trade and resources, went almost inevitably into the hands of the British merchant and trader, and has thus been lost to the country, must now be kept at home; for it is on the keeping it at home in the hands of natives that a rapid progress in Africa absolutely depends. That surplus, we say, which hitherto has, by some means or other, found its way into the hands of the British merchants, traders, and European agents, must in future be kept as much as possible in the hands of the native traders and producers. The question is, how is this to be accomplished. It must be done partly by them and partly for them. They must exercise prudence, self-restraint and self-denial, as well as industry and intelligence; and they must be aided in England by zeal and faithfulness, and the most strict and scrupulous honesty in every dealing with them. On this side they ought to have every advantage which the British markets can afford, paying only a fair and open and recognized charge for the services rendered to them; and they, on their side, must restrain themselves within the limits which what they themselves possess will allow.

The liberated slave represented the best elements of the negro population of his day. At the same time, in America, there was no place for him. He could not enjoy the privileges of a white man, he had lost the legal protection of his master; he was in fact neither slave nor free. It was to meet his wants that the Liberian enterprise was organised. None but liberated slaves were, at first, permitted to take part in it. Many of them were well educated and possessed advantages which might have made life in America more attractive than the hardships and dangers of a colonising experiment. White men were in the first instance excluded from citizenship in the new colony, and for many years Liberia was simply what it professed to be—a community of negroes, who sought in Africa the enjoyment of a freedom that could be only nominal in America.\n\nNotwithstanding the care taken the first band of settlers had to fight for their existence and owed the victory which established them upon the coast to the aid of an English man-of-war. Thus England saved the life of the young colony, and in the sequel the bond then established between them has never been forgotten on either side. In 1824 the town which the settlers had raised received the name of Monrovia bestowed upon it in honour of the then President of the United States. At the same time the social condition of the colonists gave the name of Liberia to their settlement. The colony flourished, agriculture was developed; a policy of trade with the natives and road and bridge making was inaugurated with much success, and in 1828 a charter of government which contained the germ of a more elaborate constitution was issued by the Colonisation Society. From the beginning the principle of self-government was recognised in a liberal manner. The agent and vice-agent alone were nominated by the Society, all subordinate officers were elected by the Colony, but the vote was restricted to landowners. The ""Maryland Colonisation Society"" had established another community on the same coast, in which the sale of intoxicating liquors was entirely forbidden. To these in 1833 and 1835 was added a Quaker colony from Pennsylvania, under whose auspices a detachment of artisans came to form part of the population of the State. The new arrivals settled in Grand Bassa, and in 1839 Liberia was divided into two counties, Montserrado, containing the capital, and Grand Bassa.

Barclay, Secretary of State of Liberia, wrote as follows to Charles Hall Adams, Esq., Consul at Boston: ""In former years the volume of trade between the two countries (Liberia and the United States) was much larger than at present. Our palm oil and camwood were the chief productions exported to the United States, but since kerosene and cotton seed oil have come prominently to the front there, the exports of palm oil to that country have become almost nil compared with what it used to be. In those days it was not an uncommon thing for a single ship to take, among other products, palm oil to the value of 28,000 dols. to 36,000 dols. The vacancy caused by the decline of the trade of this article in the United States has not been filled. Your figures with reference to the export of coffee into the United States have been carefully scanned. We are entirely in accord as to the fact that our trade in this article might be increased to much larger proportions, and the quantity exported to the United States might be multiplied a hundred fold. Yet when the facts of the culture being in its infancy and of there being no banks nor other financial institutions to assist the growers, and no machinery, except in a few instances, are considered, I am of the opinion that our cultivators have made a tolerable good showing in foreign markets. The total product for 1887 was about 1,200,000 lbs., which are distributed as follows: to Germany, 606,000 lbs.; United States, 301,000 lbs.; Belgium, France, and England, 149,000 lbs.; Holland and 150,000 lbs.""\n\nBishop William Taylor, in his Quadrennial Report, states: ""The productive interests of Liberia are fairly prosperous. Within ten miles of Monrovia, up the St. Paul\'s river, there are ten steam sugar-cane crushing mills, and during the past year more than 600,000 lbs. of coffee have been exported from Monrovia.""\n\nThe fact should be noted that, by act of the national Parliament of Brazil in May, slavery was abolished throughout the Empire. For years a popular feeling in favour of emancipation has been growing; but now the government has suddenly moved in the matter and the glorious deed is done. This act is one in which philanthropists and Christians may well rejoice, and it will have an important bearing on the interests of the kingdom of Christ in Brazil and in Africa.

As matters have come to such a crisis, perhaps you will allow me to lay before your readers some details of the whole matter in dispute, by which they may be better able to judge whether such arrest was really justified by the facts.\n\nAfter the famous Berlin Conference of 1884, it was arranged by the British authorities that some one should be sent out to the Oil Rivers to proclaim a Protectorate on behalf of Great Britain over the whole district; and accordingly a gentleman was sent out as Consul, who was empowered to sign a treaty with the native kings and chiefs of the various places, of which Opobo, where Ja Ja is King, was one. One of the conditions of the treaty which Ja Ja signed (Article 6) expressly prohibited strangers going to the interior markets; this condition being further substantiated by a letter from the Consul to Ja Ja; the effect and intention of this being to secure that the European agents should only obtain their goods from the interior through Ja Ja and his chiefs.\n\nAbout two years ago, owing to the depression in the oil trade, some of these agents agreed among themselves that the price of the oil and other native productions should be reduced; and Ja Ja accordingly was communicated with upon the subject, and he expressed his readiness to accept their terms; but that the ""topside"" (a general term among the traders there, meaning commission) should be allowed to him and his chiefs, as before. This the agents would not agree to; they were willing to continue the usual topside to Ja Ja himself, but not to his chiefs. Ja Ja remonstrated with them, and pointed out that Opobo was made by himself and his chiefs. Immediately a white flag was hoisted in five of the factories, which meant that they stop all further business with the natives. One of the firms concerned refused to agree to this suspension, and continued to trade as before.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1887#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.623, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE FUTURE OF AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""This argument is, of course, based upon the results of negro self-government in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Liberia has been a black republic for forty years; Sierra Leone has been a negro colony for a century; and it cannot be denied that each of these communities has made very gratifying progress. Yet, upon Dr. Blyden's own showing, that progress has been but partial, he still has to complain of his countrymen's imitativeness and lack of backbone. The responsibility for this, undoubtedly, rests to some extent upon the unsuitable character of the education which the civilized negroes have received; but it is more to the purpose to remember that three generations is a very brief period in the development of a pagan people. How slow the work of civilization in Liberia has been may be seen from the fact that, whereas there are some twenty thousand Christian negroes in the republic, there are more than a million who are pagans. And now we inevitably come to the primary question of all: whether or not the presumed racial inferiority of the negro is proved. Dr. Blyden pleads eloquently for his fellows, and triumphantly asks: How could an inferior race have produced Toussaint L'Ouverture? The question is not unnatural, but it is far from logical. The matter, as it fashions itself to us, is, and is likely to remain for a long time to come, an open one. The negro has, as yet, enjoyed no sufficient opportunity of proving either his mental equality with or his inferiority to the white. The experience of Sierra Leone and Liberia, so far as it has gone, has been in his favour; what we know of his moral history in that other black republic, Hayti, and in the United States, is at the best negative. As time goes on, the question, which is far more momentous than would appear to the unthinking, will settle itself. Emigration from America to Liberia, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, is proceeding satisfactorily; and Dr. Blyden states that 200,000 negroes in the United States are prepared to return to the land of their fathers. But colonization by private effort is, at the best, exceedingly slow; and in this instance it is perhaps well that it is so, since the gradual settlement of Liberia is far more likely to provide material for a strong and healthy State than a hasty rush would be. Social reformers for many a year to come will watch the experiment, as they have watched it in the past, with keen interest. The chief danger lies, as Dr. Blyden constantly points out, in the tendency to Europeanize the negro—to supersede customs and practices which are useful and often necessary in Africa by customs utterly out of place there. The ill-directed zeal of some of the less reflective missionaries has, no doubt, been to blame for some of this; but there is, we fancy, very little to complain of upon this head now. Let it be once proved beyond all doubt that negroes can found flourishing colonies, can develop the limitless resources of the continent which has been the cradle of their race; and, above all, that they can govern themselves prudently and self-reliantly,—and there will open up before the black man the assurance of a future as splendid and far-reaching as any that ever presented itself to a white conqueror."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1887#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.617, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Progress on the West African Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The rivers are connected by a network of cross creeks, being indeed one delta; so from the Opobo Ja Ja\'s people found their way to the interior oil markets, and the oil trade of Opobo was established.

Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets. Ja Ja was made prisoner by Consul Johnstone, and carried off to Accra. An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river. He will, however, be allowed an annual pension of £800 for life.\n\nThe principle having been laid down that Europeans may trade in the interior, it becomes imperative to assume definite authority over the district.

Some tribe is reached who cannot understand dual control; they insist on customs, perhaps; are ""chastised"" by the Consul; they retaliate, and finally an occupation is proclaimed.

The history of the region from the Mono to the Niger is therefore best conceived as an account of the interpØnØtration, not only between and among the Aja, the Yoruba, the Bariba and the Edo, but also between them individually and severally and such neighbours as the Nupe, the Jukun, the Kanuri, the Gbari, the Hausa and the Fulbe (Fulani) to the north; the Ewe, the Ga, the Adangbe, the Krobo and the Fante to the west; and the Ijo, the Itsekiri, the Isoko, the Urhobo, the western Igbo, the Igala, the Igbira and the Basa to the east.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Cameroon coast and its hinterland 14', 'content': 'The Cameroon coast, including a number of rocky offshore islands, is generally characterized by a maze of mangrove swamps, creeks and inlets, immediately behind which lies the tropical rain forest.

These peoples, whose traditions suggest common origins and affini- ties, are basically agriculturists, fishermen, and hunters. They bartered fish for food at markets. They were generally organized under autonomous villages, but sometimes as among the Bubi, Duala, and Isuwu, there were petty paramount chiefs. Among the Duala, Isuwu, and others, the most prestigious secret society was the Jfengu, based on the veneration of water spirits. 16 As in the case of the Niger delta peoples, these north-western Bantu communities were subjected to pressure in the nineteenth century from Christian missionaries, European traders and imperialists. The greatest pressure came from the abolitionists$^{17}$ because, by the beginning of the nineteenth century, each of the communities included a lower class of slaves and the attempt to abolish the institution of slavery created for them a critical economic problem in terms both of finding substitute products such as palm oil and palm kernels in place of slaves and of finding adequate labour to produce and transport these products.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Cameroon coast and its hinterland 14 > The Ogowe basin and surrounding regions 23', 'content': 'This development of commercial activity on the coast had major conse› quences.

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure.

The eventual substitution of French for Portuguese control of the area of the Gulf of Benin west of the Werne still left a residue of Latin culture sufficient to make Brazilians prefer this to the eastern coast, where Latin cultural influence was destined for eventual extinction. Consequently, it was in the area that eventually became French Dahomey that is the western parts of the region under discussion - that Brazilian Africans made their greatest impact. Not only did they co-operate with the French in the latter's successful bid to conquer Dahomey and create their new colony: Brazilians also ranked first and foremost in the colony in taking full advantage of French colonial education, thus making them a crucial factor in the growth of Dahomey as the 'Quartier Latin of French West Africa'. 45 However, this dichotomy in the locational focus of the impact of Saros and Brazilians must not be interpreted as contradictory to the overall development of the Mono-Niger region as an integral whole.

In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

Here we have in mind the rise of new organizations which helped to mediate the adjustment of many individuals and their rural homes to the new demands and norms of colonial society. These new organizations have generally been described as 'voluntary' by social scientists. They are 'voluntary' in the sense that people are not born into them as they are born into lineages, villages or ethnic groups. But closer analysis would show that for some of them, especially the ethnic-based welfare or improvement associations, membership is not that voluntary since the practical alternative to member› ship is generally ostracism of a kind.\nAfricanists are agreed on the social conditions which brought these organizations into being. It has been found that they generally originated in the urban centres, although some of them - like the ethnic-based ones - in time established home branches. The fact was that, as Professor Wallerstein has aptly put it, migration from 'the traditional rural to the modern urban area' led to 'dislocation and disorientation for the indivi› dual'.$^{8}$ Since neither the traditional society nor the colonial administration had the means to step in and meet the new needs of such migrants, they had to evolve their own institutions, systems and norms for achieving meaningful existence in the strange and heady social world of the town.\nThe studies of Godfrey Wilson in East Africa have shown that there was a clear correlation between the pressure of colonial society and the formation of these organizations. Thus Kenyan Africans, whose traditional culture came under unusually severe pressure from colonial rule and settler aggressiveness, had stronger and much more numerous ethnic associations than Africans in neighbouring territories like Tanganyika and Uganda. There was thus an element of individual self-protection and selfstabilization in the formation of the associations. Furthermore, urban conditions of existence created opportunities that made it relatively easy to form such organizations since, as Thomas Hodgkin has put it, it provided 'physical centres ... where men and women, with particular interests in common, can collide with one another'. 9"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A common pattern of the movement of cultural forms and their concrete manifestations, the incident provides an apt model of survival, even renewal of cultural values in the face of religious and other more socially intensive forms of domination.

On the opposite side of this clearing the Pangwes were at work preparing to build a town; and the moment we were discovered they raised a wild shout, seized their arms, and rushing down surrounded us. Fortunately their king, who was on the ground directing their work, hastened to our relief, and soon dispersed the noisy rabble. He then seated himself upon a fallen tree, and motioned us to sit, one on his right and the other on his left hand, and by kindly gestures and a smiling countenance assured us of his protection, and soon made us feel quite at ease. Then, through the imperfect medium of our interpreter, we told him who we were, and the object of our visit. His majesty replied, giving us a cordial welcome. He said in his interior home he had heard of white men, but had never expected to see one; and as an apology for not having a town to welcome us to, and a house in which to show us hospitality, stated that he had but recently come down from the highlands, toward which he pointed, and had not yet been able to finish a permanent dwelling-house. He inquired our names, and tried to repeat them, and told us that his was Nteke. He gazed upon us with wonder, examined our clothing, white skins, and straight hair, and, slapping his hands upon the sides of his body, uttered his amazement in shouts of laughter, in which his people joined heartily. We exhibited to his astonished view our pocket-knives, compass, and watch, all of which he examined with cautious and timid interest; when finally I took a lucifer match from my pocket, and, after showing him that it was a dry stick, ignited it upon the log on which we were seated. The instant he saw the smoke, followed by a blaze, he sprang from his seat and fled in terror, and there was a general stampede among his followers. He evidently regarded this as a supernatural act, and feared that something more terrible might follow.

A village named ""Hunsiqueen"" has recently made a fence, stopping interior people from coming to Grand Popo beach to purchase their wants; why we merchants here cannot understand. Grand Popo, in 1875, agreed with T. B. Williams to open the salt trade at Grand Popo. The said T. B. Williams gave these natives some puncheons of rum, some gin, curries, &c., gratifying them for the kindness. Ever since then the salt trade was opened free of charge and molestation.\n\nMr. Editor, the interior people come here especially on account of salt. The Grand Popo people are daily wronging and offending the traders. They catch our girls in lieu of another country\'s debts; they rob our canoes, plunder our factories, organize bands of thieves and depredators to do all kinds of mischievous acts. Is it not time that Consul Hopkins should give them a call here? In landing goods at the beach there is a risk; a good watchman must be there to watch them, or the owner will be the sufferer. When they wrong us they always say, ""He is a white man; let us make a fool of him."" The people of Grand Popo are of mixed tribes.\n\nPray, for the goodness that you have done to many of the surrounding villages—may that goodness be shown at Grand Popo. Some Frenchmen, in the month of July or thereabouts, called here to investigate a certain robbery that was committed by Hunsiqueen. To our sorrow and regret, no redress was given.\n\nto these Frenchmen. Grand Popo had better bear in mind that lions are not to be compared with dogs. The time is fast approaching when these barbarians will learn the greatness as well as the goodness of England.\n\nI hope that soon the whole Coast of Africa will be ceded to England. Then the slave-dealers and evil-doers will take to their wings and fly to the back part of Africa. The Quittah people are now enjoying English liberty, which years before was prevented by Amargashie, &c. So in future Grand Popo will be out of the hands of our —, who darken the eyes of others, &c.\n\nIf we build our houses here, making trade, what is the use if Grand Popo should stop our trade? We shall protest against it. It will only delay two weeks in getting Consul Hopkins down. When a dispute arose between Little Popo and Sierra Leone, did not Consul Hopkins do justice?

Here there is a sudden rise of 4,000ft. Up to the country of the Bali the ground falls but little, and it then slopes away to the north-west, particularly in South Adamawa. At Takum the traveller emerges from a mountain range, which stretches from the north-east south of Yola; west of Takum extensive plains follow each other down to the Binué. The grass land in the Bali region is treeless and fairly hilly; only in the valleys of the water-courses is bush country found. In the other parts of the grass lands traversed the savanna is characterised by small trees of about 20ft. high, stunted by the grass fires. These trees at times grow so thickly that they offer a welcome shade for the otherwise sun-scorched lands of Adamawa. The river valley of the Calabar reaches right up to the foot of the West African table-land. The Katsena-allah has a north-easterly direction, and is separated from the Calabar by the border lands of the plateau regions. The mountain chains, mostly composed of crystalline slates, have a general run from south-east to north-west, with transverse valleys running north and south. The mountain outlines in the southern portion of this region are mostly roundish; but in Adamawa proper there is an abundance of sharp, jagged formations, and huge rock pyramids, cones, and crests projecting 300ft. above their surroundings continually meet the gaze. Alluvial iron ore is plentiful, and the iron industry among the Bali is in a highly developed condition. The country is poor in many places between Yola and Gashka, where the laterite and disintegrated quartz occupy extensive wastes, which vividly recall the lands bordering on the Lower Congo. The interior of the Cameroons is much poorer than East and South Africa, although not barren. The elephant is the chief characteristic of the country. Antelopes are numerous in the lowlands of the Binué; monkeys and chimpanzees are plentiful in the deserts to the south of Takum, where the tracks made by them are often very similar to the native paths, and on many occasions led the expedition astray. The abundance of domestic animals in the interior—great buffaloes, maned sheep, and fowls—is in great contrast to the poor condition of the cattle-rearing industry in the West African coast regions, and the same can be said of Adamawa. There is no special distinction between the population of the primeval forest districts and that of the grass lands, although the latter is decidedly more developed and freer; it is as if the boundlessness of the savanna reflected itself in the people inhabiting it. All the negro races in the interior of the Cameroons are fully medium-sized—indeed, among the Bali, for example, the traveller meets with well-proportioned herculean figures. In the forest regions and among the Bali clever frisure of the hair are customary; the men in Adamawa mostly have their heads clean shaven, while the women have a great preference for towering chignons. The Bali place great value upon oblong skulls and endeavour to shape the heads of newly-born children accordingly—a peculiarity which is very seldom met with in Africa.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Interesting Account of the Pangwes of Equatorial Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Mpongwes and other tribes call them Pangwes, but in their own language P is sounded like F, and they call themselves Fanhi, plural Bianhi. They are, probably, a branch of a large family of Ethiopians who occupy the vast equatorial regions lying east of the Sierra del Crystal Mountains, and a great lake of which they speak may be west of the ""Albert Nyanza,"" described by Baker. They have now taken possession of nearly all the upper waters of the Gaboon and the surrounding country, having driven the Babékés and Shekanies before them, and in a few years will probably reach the seaboard. According to a statement recently made by Vice-Admiral Fleuriot Langle, at a meeting of the French Geographical Society, there are no less than 80,000 of them in the vicinity of the Gaboon, and the number is rapidly increasing. But I do not agree with the Admiral\'s opinion that their language nearly resembles the Zulu of South Africa; for having, with a committee of linguists in the United States, carefully compared the Zulu with the dialects of this part of Africa a few years since, we discovered no such connection. Their language has been partially acquired and reduced to writing by members of our mission, and it does not seem to differ very materially from those of the coast tribes; though it is, in character with the people who speak it, more harsh and abrupt, caring less for fluency and euphony. When first discovered, the Fanhs were the most robust and athletic race of Africans we had ever seen; but in their transition from the more elevated interior to the low malarious regions of the coast, we notice a gradual physical deterioration, which may be owing, not entirely to change of climate and location, but to less active, daring habits, and to the destroying influence of foreign liquors, of which they were formerly in blissful ignorance. When we first made their acquaintance, domestic slavery was unknown among them, and it is not probable that the foreign slave-trade had ever preyed upon them to any great extent. They are great elephant hunters, and have much skill in entrapping and killing these lords of the African forest; and most of the ivory which is shipped from this part of the coast passes through their hands. In addition to guns, with which they are now generally supplied, they make use of bows and poisoned arrows in hunting and war. Their arrows are dipped in a preparation made from a bean, which grows upon a forest tree called Oni, the effect of which is almost certain death. But they have also knowledge of the bark of a certain tree which is an antidote to this poison. Their spears, knives, and broad double-edged swords or daggers are curious specimens of native workmanship.

The walls of their dwellings are rarely, if ever, whitewashed, and are often crowded, ill-ventilated, and dirty. Most of the rooms are miserably small, dark, damp, and badly ventilated, especially those devoted to sleep. In their sleeping places the poorer classes, and many persons in better circumstances, keep all the dirty clothing not in wear either about their beds or hanging from the wall, scraps of food and putrid fish being strewed about or collected in corners. The lower rooms open into inner courts, where, in fine weather, the members of the several families meet, and where they often cook and eat their food. The houses of what may be termed the middling class are well furnished with European articles of cabinet furniture, with crockery, glass, and mirrors, while the walls are decorated with cheap prints. The wealthy native gentlemen (living in the seaboard towns) live in well-built houses, commodiously, and often elegantly, furnished; but few of them have fireplaces in the public rooms or bedrooms—a want which impairs health in a country exposed to heavy night-dews, and in some wet seasons to heavy falls of rain. The general custom on the Gold Coast is to burn charcoal in clay pots in the public rooms and bedrooms when the weather is damp or cold. From inquiries I have made, I find that twenty may be safely reckoned the average number of tenants living under one roof in the two-storied houses in Cape Coast, and it often happens that sober, decent people dwell in one apartment, and a drunken man in the next, for I regret to say that drunkenness is a wide-spread vice among the natives—a circumstance chiefly dependent upon the cheapness of the spirits imported from the United States, Holland, and the Brazils.""\n\nAnd again:—\n\n""The mass of the inhabitants bury their dead in the basement floor of their houses—a practice not confined to the pagan part of the population, but also practised by many respectable and wealthy families.

These tombs in this way become family banks, and in the time of trouble the gold so deposited is applied to meet pressing claims or other family purposes.

In this paper the author described his impressions of the lower part of the Niger and of the Central Soudan acquired in the course of a commercial and political mission last year to the Sultans of Sokoto and Gandu. On his way along the West Coast of Africa he noted the influence for good or evil which contact with white men has had upon the natives, and concluded that while there is much we have reason to be proud of, there is still more of which we ought to feel ashamed. He expressed the opinion that for every negro the missionaries have influenced for good by Christian teaching, a thousand had been driven into deeper degradation by other influences. He also found the settlements absurdly over-governed on a system totally unsuited to the peculiarities of barbarous races. That part of the Niger which the author traversed is divided into three sections according to their physiographical features—(1) the delta, (2) the low-lying region between the delta and the coast mountains, and (3) the irregular valley which has been cut out of the interior plateau. On reaching Lokoja, at the confluence of the Benué with the Niger and the commencement of the third section, the Central Soudan is entered. The changes which occur here, whether physiographical or ethnological, are striking in the extreme. ""Behind us are the unwashed, barbarous *sans culottes* of the coast region, with fetishism, cannibalism, and the gin bottle in congenial union; before us lies a people astir with religious activity and enthusiasm, and wonderfully far advanced in the arts and industries."" Mr. Thomson took occasion to point out the enormous influence for good—though not unmixed—which Mahomedanism exercises among the inhabitants of the Central Soudan. On reaching Rabba in the Kupé country the river journey ended, and the journey to Sokoto had to be continued by means of the ordinary African caravan. The difficulties with the porters were described and the countries traversed were sketched, the route being through Kupé and Yauri to the Gulbi-n-Gindi, which is then followed to the neighbourhood of Sokoto. In conclusion, the author described the commercial prospects of these parts. He expressed the opinion ""that in all the wide range of tropical Africa there is no more promising field for commerce than this semi-civilized region which forms the central area of the Niger basin."" He came to this conclusion not on the ground that it is more fertile or more rich in natural productions—though in those respects comparing favourably with other parts—but for other reasons. These may be briefly summarized as follows: (1) It is more densely populated than any other part of Africa, and divided into powerful and, in Africa, exceedingly well-governed empires, in which life and property are almost as sacred as in Great Britain. (2) The peoples are far advanced in civilization, and throughout Northern Africa are famed for the excellences of their various manufactures. (3) The necessary machinery and organization to work the inland trade is ready to hand, as the Houssa trader is famed for his commercial genius and enterprising spirit. (4) An efficient transport service already exists, as the horse, camel, bullock, and donkey flourish in their thousands. (5) Owing to the much sterner conditions under which the people live, labourers are to be found without stint. (6) The River Niger presents an uninterrupted waterway into the very heart of this region. (7) The country, for Africa, is eminently healthy, especially away from the immediate neighbourhood of the rivers. While thus presenting such a favourable view of the prospects of the Central Soudan, the author was careful to warn people that African trade is not to be developed with a sudden rush, but as the results of forethought and careful plodding.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1886#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Capabilities of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Dear Brother in the cause of God and humanity,—The elevation of Africa is near my heart, and anything that promises to aid in rescuing her from her long and deep degradation meets a warm response in my heart.

She needs missionaries and teachers, but these alone will not do the work needed.

Coffee and cotton of fine quality grow wild abundantly, and can be cultivated to any extent to supply Manchester and every cotton factory in Christendom. There only needs to do this to start it all along the Western Coast, and make a market for them, and the natives will go to producing them. They will work at what they can make the most money by. Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down. These things I have seen.\n\n3. And her minerals are rich and abundant. Gold and iron ore, the purest in the world, is very abundant in many parts.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

All these go to account for their conformation.\n\nIn every part of Africa we occasionally meet with a perfectly white child, the offspring of perfectly black parents; these are known by the name of albino. Here is a freak of nature by which they are superlatively white, with the dermal cells perfectly destitute of those pigment matters found even amongst Europeans. If a great many of these albinoes were formed into a town, and propagation encouraged, a new race of people would be formed, which, but for the climate and domestic habits, would be as white as a Greenlander.\n\nWe suppose that of the early inhabitants of this globe one family, passing through the Isthmus of Suez, entered into Africa, another branch taking quite an opposite direction, and proceeding to the temperate zone, gave origin to a different and distinct race of men, who adapted themselves to the climates they inhabited, changing their tropical habits for others suitable to the climatorial influence of the temperate and polar zones; and thus, after the lapse of ages, forming the great Caucasian race. In like manner the Mongolian race has been also formed.\n\nThe difference in shape and peculiarity of configuration in the different races may be accounted for by the different domestic habits of each class of men, the manner in which their offspring are brought up, the degree of admixture between the different tribes and races, the difference in habitation, the degree of intellectual culture, the influence of the rites and ceremonies of the religious tenets which they hold, and last, but not the least, the different climatic influences which operate on each class.\n\nFrom the foregoing the reflective mind will at once perceive that the race which descended to Africa were subject to several vicissitudes, which had a most depressing effect on them, and which deprived them of that brilliancy which is shown by the other races, but who, after a change of their religion and the cultivation of their minds, endeavour to claim their position in the world's history. This displeases some of the Japhetic race, especially those residing in Africa, and they consequently use all their endeavours to crush them.\n\nIt can now be seen that, believing in the genuineness and authenticity of the most holy and most ancient Book, man, or the race which inhabits this globe, had one origin; that they were dark in colour, if not black; and that, having first peopled the track of land eastward of the Mediterranean, from their descendants, the Ethiopian, Caucasian, and Mongolian races proceeded."", 'last_edit_date': '1865-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1865#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Relation between the Mohammedan Tribes of Africa and the Christians', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Professor Blyden (interviewed in the United States), says the *African Repository*, when asked ""What is the relation between the native Mohammedan tribes of Africa and the Christians?"" replied: ""Christianity has not had a fair chance in Africa. In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.614, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ancient Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'hair of Buddha belong to the black race, and Nahsi is the negro name.

The result has been unspeakably disappointing. Leaving out of consideration the towns of Sierra Leone and Lagos, where the conditions have been abnormal, the tendency has been everywhere in the line of deterioration. There is absolutely not a single place, where the natives are left to their own free-will, in which there is the slightest evidence of a desire for better things. The worst vices and diseases of Europe have found a congenial soil, and the taste for spirits has risen out of all proportion to their desire for clothes—the criterion with many of growth in grace.\n\nThe inaptitude of the natives for civilization is nowhere shown more distinctly than among the Kru-boys, a tribe which every one admits is the most docile, the most manageable, and most intelligent on the coast. To a man, the Kru-boys have spent years in contact with such ameliorating influences as are to be found in those parts, yet their tastes have risen no higher than a desire for gin, tobacco, and gunpowder.

Eternally gin, tobacco, or gunpowder. These are the sole wants aroused by a century of trade and contact with Europeans! And yet how is this region represented in England?

It is indeed a compendium. It places before us in brief but luminous sketches, and with the aid of sixteen admirable maps and some seventy illustrations, all that is publicly known about Africa and its peoples—their specific peculiarities, character, manners, customs, and condition, physical and moral; with enumeration of its varied products, its trade and commerce. It is an admirable volume for all who desire general information respecting that great continent, into the dense darkness of which the light of civilization and Christianity has begun to penetrate, through the devoted exertions of missionaries and scientific explorers. Africa does not present us with any very pleasing pictures. They are all of barbarism, and for the most part barbarism of the lowest and most disgusting type, and yet such as awakes and impels to active exertion the warmest sympathies and desires of the Christian and philanthropist. Such books as this of Mr. Stanford\'s are particularly valuable in view of the extremely limited degree of information respecting Africa possessed even by the majority of well-educated people in England. So many active agencies are now at work in and for Africa that some more intimate knowledge of it must be desired; while yet the labour of wading through long and dreary books of African travel, with their sadly monotonous succession of pictures of sparsely-inhabited countries, and of ignorance, suffering, cruelty, and moral degradation everywhere, deters most people from seeking it in their pages. This ""Compendium"" meets such desires, and gets rid of such difficulties, offering as a prize to be gained by a few leisure hours\' reading all that it is essential well-educated people should know of this great continent. The degree of knowledge thus to be obtained may lead some whose attention has not hitherto been called in that direction to desires and sympathies with regard to that long-neglected quarter of the world, and its wretched populations. We therefore hail its appearance with great pleasure, and strongly recommend ""Stanford\'s Compendium—Africa"" to our readers.

He assumed, in common with all who spoke afterwards, that the time has come for Europe to open up the Continent of Africa; and stated that though we know much about its interior we lack information about its climate; and elaborated the conditions necessary for successful European colonisation. Climate is a most important consideration, and all maritime zones and districts below 5,000 feet elevation must be dismissed as useless. In his treatment of such matters as malaria and fever, he said that canoe voyages along rivers are especially dangerous to health, but steamers and railways will give rapid access to the healthy areas. Yet the localities which fulfil the needful conditions are few; West Africa is out of the question, so far as regards its entire colonisation by Europeans. Sir John Kirk is of opinion that Matabeleland will probably be the first site of a colony in tropical Africa. There are further the high plateau west of Nyassa and Baloka land; and Masailand will be fit for colonisation when rapid access is given by the construction of a railway. The only other district possible for residence for the white races is Abyssinia. Nyassaland was mentioned as a district suitable for settlement and not colonisation. Such districts abound, and may be settled in by isolated European families, and become sanatoria or the homes of a few agricultural settlers. He condemns the advocacy of a half-caste race, but recommends the introduction of small colonies of British Indians in the districts less suited to Europeans as an example to the negro. This idea was further elaborated in the conclusion of the paper which had been written by Captain Lugard, and which Sir John Kirk read. Captain Lugard maintains that the object lesson of Indian village life will be an important factor in raising the negro; Indians will be invaluable as artisans and skilled labour men in the hot districts. Improved varieties of produce should be introduced, and the European should develop the country by the preservation of forests, protection of the elephant, zebra, and game, drainage of swamps, and reclamation of waste lands.\n\nCount Pfeil, delegate of the Thuringian Geographical Society, has taken a leading part in founding one of the German colonies, and he read a paper on the development of tropical Africa. He holds that this can best be achieved by scientific exploration and observation, and that to make tropical Africa healthy would be the greatest step towards colonising it. On the question of the Native races Count Pfeil said that he is not one of those who think that the negro can be guided by setting him a good example and reading homilies to him.

Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

Does it constitute a break with Africa's past or was it just a mere episode in its history, an episode which is of limited importance and which did not affect the course of African development? Here again, conflicting answers have been given to this question. To some historians, indeed a very large number, including the Marxist and the development and anti-development theorists but for very different reasons, though colonialism was a short interlude, it nevertheless was of great significance for Africa and left an indelible impression on Africa. As R. Oliver and N. Atmore contend: 'Measured on the time-scale of history, the colonial period was but an interlude of comparatively short duration. But it was an interlude that radically changed the direction and momentum of African history.'$^{50}$ Gann and Duignan also regard the colonial era 'as most decisive for the future of Africa'.$^{51}$ The answer of the Marxists and the underdevelopment theorists is neatly summed up in the title of Rodney's book, namely, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa. On the other hand, there are others who regard the colonial impact as skin-deep and that colonialism did not con› stitute any break with the African past. In a series of publications, 52 J. F. A. Ajayi has consistently maintained that the impact of colonialism on Africa has been exaggerated, that colonialism 'represents only an episode in a long and eventful history', and did not cause any break in continuity, that Africans retained some control over their own destinies and 'to the extent to which Africans retained initiative, the ability of Europeans to make entirely new departures in African history was limited'. Hopkins has also maintained that the 'colonial era has ceased to be regarded as the sole substance of African history and there are sound reasons for thinking that colonial rule itself had a less dramatic and a less pervasive economic impact than was once supposed'. He has insisted that colonial› ism did 'not create modernity out of backwardness by suddenly disrupting a traditional state of low-level equilibrium' and that 'the main function of the new rulers was to give impetus to a process of economic development which was already under way'. 53 To this author, there is really no simple yes or no answer to this question since the impact of colonialism"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""also created in some Africans a deep sense of inferiority which Afigbo has defined above quite succintly as 'a tendency to lose confidence in himself and his future in short, a state of mind which at times encouraged an uncritical imitation of [and one may add subservience to] European powers' (Chapter 19).

Most of the discussion, if not all of it, has been centred on the dichotomy between resisters, who by implication are to be praised as heroes, and so-called collaborators, who also by implication are to be condemned as traitors. This classification came about as a result of the nationalist struggle for independence in Africa, as elsewhere in the world. Those involved in the movement tended to see themselves as heirs to a long tradition of struggle whose roots go back to the beginning of this century, if not earlier. It was assumed that independence was a good thing and to strive for it was natural. Consequently, all those who had resisted European penetration of Africa, in order to preserve its inde› pendence, were heroes to be emulated and given an honourable place in the histories of the countries that had gained their independence through resistance to colonial rule. Put in these terms, this view is an attempt to use the standards of the present, with the aid of hindsight, to interpret the events of the past. In the colonial situation, those who resisted were described by colonial officials as short-sighted while those who collaborated were seen as far-sighted. Today, nationalist historians in East Africa con› demn so-called collaborators, especially chiefs, and praise resisters. 1\nAmong the resisters, there were also divisions. There were those who took to armed confrontation with the intruders - active resistance. Then there were those who, though they did not take to arms, refused to co› operate with the intruders.

Cre› ativity became especially necessary where a small number of Europeans lived among a large number of Africans as was the case in many colonies of exploitation such as Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Saint-Domingue. Where the European population failed to comprise a critical mass, the Africans had to build a society from a diverse collectivity of individuals who had little more in common than their skin colour and their servility.

For centuries marronage, or the flight from the slave system, existed as an integral aspect of slavery.$^{53}$ In Brazil, the north-east witnessed the establishment of the quilombo of Palmares which lasted almost a century and which was eliminated only with the largest military force ever mounted in the Americas by the Portuguese and Brazilians. Maroon towns existed for equally long periods in Esmeraldas in Ecuador and in parts of the Blue Mountains and the Cockpit Country of Jamaica. Marronage manifested not only the wish to be free, it was an eloquent and visible condemnation of the system of slavery by Africans.\nBy the time African slavery was eliminated in the Americas, the position of the African sector had worsened dramatically from what it had been a century before. The political and economic reconstruction that followed the Civil War in the USA accompanied a movement of legal discrimination and social and economic exclusion of the non-white sector, characterized by segregated institutions, lynchings, and overtly racist societies and organ› izations, which combined until the middle of the twentieth century.$^{54}$ The general conditions experienced by black Americans then compared with those prevailing today in a more extreme way in South Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""By 1935, as is evident from the earlier chapters of this volume, colonialism had been firmly fastened on Africa like a steel grid, and it looked as if it was going to remain there forever. However, colonialism proved just as ephemeral as any other institution created and maintained by force. Within a matter of only some forty-five years from 1935, the colonial system had been uprooted from over 90% of Africa and confined only to that part of the continent south of the Limpopo River. That is to say, colonial› ism lasted in most parts of Africa for under a hundred years, indeed from the 1880s to the 1960s. In the history of a people and a whole continent, this is a very brief span indeed. How and why this incredible feat of the uprooting of colonialism was accomplished, or, to quote the words of Margery Perham, why this 'astonishingly rapid emancipation since 1950' ' form two of the main themes of the concluding volume of this History. In the concluding chapter of this volume, however, we would like to address ourselves to two main questions. First, what legacies did colonialism bequeath to Africa, or what impact did it make on Africa? The second question is, in view of this impact or balance sheet, what is the significance of colonialism for Africa? Does it constitute a revolutionary or important episode in the history of the continent? Was it a major break with the past of the continent, or was it, after all, a mere passing event which did not constitute a break in the history of the continent? Or as L. H.

Repatri› ation during the nineteenth century offered few material rewards for Europeans or non-Europeans. But by 1900, the divergence between Africa and the Americas had become too great. Persons of African descent became caught up in the self-consciousness of the age which produced the type of xenophobic nationalism that all but destroyed the appeal of Africa. More› over, the interest in Africa after the end of the slave trade grew from national lusts for power and wealth - and Afro-Americans lacked both political power and the wealth needed to stimulate their own interest, or influence those who were partitioning Africa into colonial spheres. The Afro-American view became focused more on the new developments within their hemisphere. Internal and inter-regional migrations and the quest to establish the good life against new deleterious challenges absorbed their attention. The African connection faded, but did not die. The return-toAfrica movement found individual promoters who could occasionally infuse the movement with new appeal. In 1897, Henry Sylvester Williams, a Trinidadian-born lawyer living in London, founded the Pan-African Association, whose later membership would include George Padmore, Kwame Nkrumah and C. L. R. James. In the 1920s Marcus Garvey founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association, a movement designed to spur African decolonization and unite all Africans wherever they were found. Garvey's organization had branches in Canada, the USA, the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa.$^{57}$ By the time that Garvey's organization collapsed in 1927, Africa, and especially the Ethiopian question, had already begun to assume paramount importance in world affairs."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The impact of Africa', 'content': 'When the American slave systems disintegrated during the nineteenth century, the basic institutional forms and social attitudes of the societies had already been established.

In some cases, the influences from Africa were strong enough and pervasive enough to forge a genuine Afro-American culture competing with, and sometimes complementing the Europeanderived culture.\nIn the USA the political-structure imposed a rigid dichotomy between black and white in the population, relegating any individual with any degree of African ancestry to the category of black.$^{51}$ By contrast, throughout the rest of the hemisphere a three-tiered social categorization prevailed, corres› ponding to the dominant groups of black, mixed, and white.

The lecture was illustrated by maps.\n\nMr. Scott Keltie began by remarking that during the past six years we had seen the bulk of a great continent parcelled out among a few great Powers. That continent was no new discovery. It was not a new world like America or Australia. It entered into the oldest traditions and the most ancient history. Long, indeed, before Greece entered the field, while yet Europe was the home of wandering barbarians, long even before Abraham left his father\'s fields, before the Phœnicians had settled themselves on the Syrian coast, one of the most wonderful civilisations on record had begun to work out its destiny on the banks of that Nile, the mystery of whose source, so long sought for, had been solved only within present memory. It was not the present business to discuss the origin or trace the history of Egypt. It was enough that the continent on which the oldest, or at least one of the oldest, civilisations was born and was developed through thousands of years, was even now less known than a continent discovered only 400 years ago, and had only during the last few years been taken seriously in hand by the peoples who had the making of the world\'s commerce and the world\'s history. It was only just 400 years since Columbus stumbled upon the New World, and yet what was in brief the history of America? It was now the home of 130,000,000 of people of European origin. It was, indeed, another Europe. The first British colonial settlement was planted in Australia little more than a century since, and it was only fifty years since that the continents there had had a free hand. Now they had 4,000,000 of people of European origin, mainly of British descent, whose trade was of the value of £120,000,000 sterling a year.\n\nThis was to be contrasted with what had taken place in Africa.

Just a little before the discovery of America thousands of the natives of the Congo were baptised by Catholic missionaries, and the Portuguese devoted themselves to the work of African evangelisation and exploration. They knew then as much of interior Africa as is known now after the great exploits of Livingstone and Stanley. There is a map in the Vatican, 300 years old, which gives the general physical relief and the river and lake systems of Africa with more or less accuracy; but the Arab geographers of a century before had described the mountain system, the great lakes, and the course of the Nile. Just about the time that Portugal was establishing a great empire on that continent, America was discovered, and it became the seat of Portuguese Power. Neither Egyptian, Carthaginian, Persian, or Roman influence was allowed to establish itself on that continent. It would seem that no solution of the African problem was to come from alien sources. Africans were not to share the fate of other dark races who have come in contact with the European. Europe was diverted to the Western Hemisphere. The energies of that conquering race were spent in building up a home for themselves on this side. Africa followed in chains.\n\nThe Negro race was to be preserved for a special work in the future. It is probable that if foreign races had been allowed to enter their country they would have been destroyed. So they were brought over to be helpers in America and at the same time to be preserved. Slavery would seem to be a strange school in which to preserve a people; but God has a way of salting as well as purifying by fire. The Europeans found in America an aboriginal race unable to co-operate with them in the labours required for the construction of the new civilisation. The Indians would not work, and have suffered the consequences of that indisposition: they have passed away.

It is indeed a compendium. It places before us in brief but luminous sketches, and with the aid of sixteen admirable maps and some seventy illustrations, all that is publicly known about Africa and its peoples—their specific peculiarities, character, manners, customs, and condition, physical and moral; with enumeration of its varied products, its trade and commerce. It is an admirable volume for all who desire general information respecting that great continent, into the dense darkness of which the light of civilization and Christianity has begun to penetrate, through the devoted exertions of missionaries and scientific explorers. Africa does not present us with any very pleasing pictures. They are all of barbarism, and for the most part barbarism of the lowest and most disgusting type, and yet such as awakes and impels to active exertion the warmest sympathies and desires of the Christian and philanthropist. Such books as this of Mr. Stanford\'s are particularly valuable in view of the extremely limited degree of information respecting Africa possessed even by the majority of well-educated people in England. So many active agencies are now at work in and for Africa that some more intimate knowledge of it must be desired; while yet the labour of wading through long and dreary books of African travel, with their sadly monotonous succession of pictures of sparsely-inhabited countries, and of ignorance, suffering, cruelty, and moral degradation everywhere, deters most people from seeking it in their pages. This ""Compendium"" meets such desires, and gets rid of such difficulties, offering as a prize to be gained by a few leisure hours\' reading all that it is essential well-educated people should know of this great continent. The degree of knowledge thus to be obtained may lead some whose attention has not hitherto been called in that direction to desires and sympathies with regard to that long-neglected quarter of the world, and its wretched populations. We therefore hail its appearance with great pleasure, and strongly recommend ""Stanford\'s Compendium—Africa"" to our readers. The educated Africans of the West Coast ought all to possess it, as in it they will see what Africa really is throughout, and the opinions current respecting it and themselves.

Until the Moslemised Arabs took it in hand there was no evidence that any enterprising peoples had crossed the Sahara, or, indeed, had ever gone beyond hail of the coast, except along the Nile Valley. It was only 460 years ago that Europe set herself to define the contour of the African coast. It was just about a century since Europe seriously set herself to the task of exploring the northern half of that continent and of discovering the course of the great River Niger. The Nile source was only reached some thirty-four years ago, and during the past thirty years more had been done to spread a knowledge of the continent than during the 3,800 years before. At last the great blanks had been filled up in all the main features. Only seven years ago the wholesale partition of the continent among the Powers of Europe had begun, and it would be instructive to inquire into the causes which had been at work to effect this action.\n\nAt the close Mr. Scott Keltie exhibited modern maps in contrast to the ancient ones, showing how rapidly of late years the knowledge of the Dark Continent had spread.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-04-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_05_1891#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.62, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Agencies at Work with Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'among other peoples.

The swarthy races in Africa have not done their part in this great work to which the Creator appointed mankind. It has yet to be accomplished, and the time seems now to be at hand for it to commence. The fringe of the continent has been touched at divers places by the hand of civilization, but only, so far, to show how lamentably inadequate and inoperative were the means hitherto employed. We shall not particularize, because the fact is patent to every one. The agencies now at work seem, however, to promise much more extensive and satisfactory results. We had intended to enter largely on their consideration this month, but although we place before our readers a portion of the public intelligence relating to them, we have determined to postpone that consideration at least until our next number. The spirit of civilized progress now claiming Africa has put forth its claims with so much vigour, at so many points, and in so many diverse ways; the public attention and interest are invited and demanded so persistently and forcibly; the torpor of the African peoples if left to themselves, and their utter inability of themselves, or by the aid of mere trading or missionary effort, to make even the smallest advances towards civilization and Christianity, has become so incontestable,—that we look forward now confidently not only to a continuance of mercantile enterprise and the efforts of Christian philanthropy in its yearning for African souls, but to the speedy operation, also, of Governments and associations in furtherance of those claims. Yes, thanks be to God, we see such forces marshalling to assail the power of Satan, the evil enemy of mankind, in Africa and throughout Africa, that, although we cannot but deplore what seems to us the mistaken award of Marshal MacMahon as regards the right of sovereignty over Delagoa Bay—respecting which we shall have something to say in our next issue—we can rejoice, and we do rejoice, in spirit.

In the first group are those organizations which could be described as purely 'social', that is devoted to promoting conviviality and relaxation. These were made necessary by the absence from the towns of the traditional forms of amusement, relaxation and citizenship training - such as the masquerades, age-grade associations and traditional festivities. There was also the attraction of forms of modern European social life as advertised in the life of the European community in each colony. In this category were the football clubs, Scout and Girl Guide movements, debating societies and alumni associations.\nIn the second group are the ethnic unions. These were an extension of rural ethnicity to the urban areas. There were different hierarchies of them - village, clan and ethnic unions. These had two main functions. One was to help the individual who had migrated newly to the town to adjust as smoothly as possible to the conditions of urban life. Thus when a migrant first reached the town, he usually made his first contacts with members of his village or clan union who would help to find him accommodation, to introduce him to employers of labour or master craftsmen to teach him modern skills. They also taught him how to comport himself in the city. Through such associations members got help when in difficulty. They could get loans to continue their business if they sustained crippling losses. Funeral, marriage and other expenses approved by the association could also be met with loans or donations from the group as the case may be. ' ° The other function of the ethnic unions was 'to provide a channel for progressive public opinion at home', especially through maintaining an organized link between the sons at home and the sons abroad. To do this they had to take an interest in the political and social development of their homes. At first this won the associations the opposition and obstruction of suspicious colonial officials. In south-eastern Nigeria, for instance, where by the 1930s the colonial power was still toiling to entrench the idea of native authorities, the formation of these unions caused uneasiness in official circles. Their activities became, on occasions, the object of secret intelligence inquiries."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.634, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': 'Nor is the \'traditional-modern\' polar model, with all its attendant implications of conflict and incompatibility, applicable to the entire spectrum of African experience of change under colonialism. There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure.

Since the late nineteenth century their number had reportedly declined owing to a higher death than birth rate, and the virtual cessation of immigration of blacks from America. The situation led to increased intermarriage and liaison, mostly between Americo-Liberian men and indigenous African women (many of whom were educated in the Liberian schools), and a corresponding increase of Liberians with mixed Americo-Liberian/indigenous African parentage. In› variably, such Liberians and indigenous African youths apprenticed to or adopted by Americo-Liberian families became assimilated to the AmericoLiberian socio-cultural milieu. 4\nThe decline in the Americo-Liberian population probably also intensified their practice of in-group marriages, and correspondingly the extended family system that had developed among them since the late nineteenth century.

Similarly, Oyo cultural influences found in eastern Yorubaland - worship of Sango, the spread of the men's loom, shoulder sling drums - must be considered not so much as evidence of Oyo hegemony before 1800 as of the nineteenth-century diaspora of the Oyo following the fall of the empire. 38 A similar influence from Benin, especially on court ceremonials, regalia and chieftaincy titles in Qwo, Ekiti, Akoko, Ondo, Ijesa - as among the Awori astride the present-day Nigeria-Benin border - showed the widespread effect of the theme of inter-group penetration and com› mensurate institutional adaptation.

This change together with the abolition of slavery, the intro› duction of western education, Christianity and Islam, the expansion of cash-crop agriculture which facilitated the acquisition of wealth in some areas and the many other avenues for advancement that the new colonial order introduced, radically altered the traditional social structure. Thus, by the 1930s, in place of the pre-colonial social classes of the traditional ruling aristocracy, the ordinary people, domestic slaves and a relatively small educated elite, had emerged a new society that had become more sharply divided than before into urban and rural dwellers, each of which was differently stratified. The urban dwellers had become divided into three main sub-groups: the elite or as others call them the administrativeclerical-professional bourgeoisie; the non-elite or, as Lloyd prefers to call them, the sub-elite, and the urban proletariat.

They did not obliterate all traces of former settlers, but where there had previously been a great variety of clan loyalties, the nineteenth century saw the gradual development of a sense of sharing the same civilization, language, and political organizations, usually in small chief› doms. A feeling of ethnic identity grew out of this shared historical experience, in which increases in population and agricultural productivity, and also encouragement of individual enterprise, played a key role. During the same period, in small high-density areas on the upper Tshikapa and the upper Kasai, there were many young Chokwe who were prepared to leave their villages and the burdensome power of the chiefs and take to the open forest, hunting elephants, setting up hives and collecting the honey and wax. Because of their skill with plants, particularly cassava, which can tolerate poor soils, the women who went with them were able to start growing crops: these women often came from small Lunda settlements along the tributaries of the Luembe, the Tshikapa, etc.\nThe assimilation of Lunda women into Chokwe society illustrates a phenomenon that was widespread throughout the 'matrilineal belt': descendants of female captives were members not of their mother's clan (this was the privilege of the free-born), but of their father's.

Though the number of patients has not been large, yet it is increasing, as the institution becomes known; and through God\'s help we have accomplished that which we proposed seven years ago—namely, the erection of a house for the sick and suffering, where they may receive help and comfort, both for body and soul. We have a kind Christian lady as the matron, and the colonial physician is the surgeon and physician of the institution. Of all our patients the seamen seem most grateful. Far away from home and friends, to meet with care and kindness, and to find the comforts of a home, with Christian sympathy; these things call out those warm and generous feelings for which seamen are proverbial. We make no extravagant outlay, but we simply desire the means to sustain this Christian home for the sick, on this unhealthy coast. There is a special work for which we now need help.

The following further particulars, gathered mainly from the *Lagos Times*, will be of interest to the many friends of Mr. Payne:—\n\nThe death of this estimable lady was an event which startled the community of Lagos to an unusual degree, owing to its apparent suddenness; for, although a few had heard that there was a slight indisposition, none expected this untoward result. The high estimation in which Mr. Payne is held in the community by foreigners and natives alike, as well as the virtues of the deceased lady, tended to invest the event with an importance altogether unique. Flags were hoisted at half-mast throughout the day, and there was every demonstration of public sympathy. We are informed that, during the illness, Mrs. Denton, the wife of his Excellency the Acting Governor, whose unaffected kindness of heart is universally known, was frequent in her visits, doing all she could to soothe and cheer up the poor sufferer. Mrs. Vernall and his Honour the Chief Justice were also among those whose kind enquiries were constant. The funeral took place on Tuesday morning, when the Rev. H. Tugwell, Minister of Christ Church, and the Hon. and Rev. J. Johnson, of St. Paul's, officiated. The coffin was borne into the church by the members of the Foresters' Court, of which Mr. Payne is Chief Ranger, and from the church to the place of interment by members of the Brazilian Emancipation Society. At the grave the Hon. and Rev. J. Johnson gave an impressive address in Yoruba, which was much appreciated by all who heard it. Particulars in regard to the life of the deceased, as well as her death-bed testimony were delicately referred to, and the sympathy of all was invoked on behalf of the bereaved husband who in three years was called to stand by the grave-side of a first and second wife. The orderliness and becoming demeanour of the large concourse of people who went all the way to the cemetery at Ikoyi was most striking. No one could have looked on the father of the deceased without being deeply affected. He was bowed with grief, and, unable to control his feelings, after all was over gave vent to loud sobs and screams which made the air ring again!\n\nThe late Mrs. Payne was sent to England in 1885, where she remained for about three years acquiring useful knowledge. But a cold contracted in that northern clime, so generally inhospitable to the Negro's constitution, laid the foundation of that pulmonary complaint which cut short her life's career in her twenty-seventh year, and only fourteen months after her marriage!""}, {'id': 6447, 'article_title': 'Farewell Dinner at Manchester House, Lagos', 'full_section_title': 'Farewell Dinner at Manchester House, Lagos', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1894#article-5', 'issue_date': '01_06_1894', 'content': 'On the following day a soirée was given in the Glover Memorial Hall to bid a general *au revoir* to Mr. Payne.

The kindness of his Excellency and Mrs. Denton in attending was appreciated by all. The evening was very enjoyably spent, dancing being interspersed with songs. Just at the close of the evening Mr. Barrister Williams, with his usual eloquence, remarked how greatly Mr. Payne is respected by all; that he was going ""to be mated"" at Accra and then proceed to England.

In spite of the abnormal severity of the winter, Mrs. Thomas enjoyed, upon the whole, very fair health, until within three weeks of the day upon which they had intended to sail from Liverpool; but on June 13th symptoms of the influenza epidemic, which, during the past few months, has worked such havoc among all classes in England, declared themselves in her. Drs. Merriman and Griffith, of South Kensington, were in attendance, and having observed symptoms of pneumonia, called in Dr. Whipham as consulting physician. On Saturday evening, the 20th inst., Mrs. Thomas informed her husband and daughter that she would not return home with them, but that she was going to a better home, having reconciled with God in spirit. On Sunday morning, June 21, the doctors expressed their fears of a fatal termination of the case; and Mrs. Thomas breathed her last in the presence of her husband, daughter, Miss Lake, and Mr. and Mrs. John Walkden, of Manchester, just before nine in the same evening.

In opening the Foresters\' High Court, the Mayor particularly referred to the presence of Mr. Payne. In course of his address, he said: I should especially like to welcome a brother who has come all the way from West Africa in the interest of Forestry. I allude to Bro. Payne, who is sitting on the dais here. We are glad to see him, and glad to know that the principles of Forestry have been promulgated in West Africa. In acknowledging the compliment, Mr. Payne said he felt it his duty to return thanks to the High Court for the kind reception that had been accorded him. Although something had been said about the credentials he had brought from Court ""Fountain of Hope,"" the fact that he had travelled 4,500 miles at his own expense was a sufficient guarantee that he came to the High Court in good faith. He could only say that since he had been in the meeting he had appreciated the kindness accorded him, and particularly the kind references of the Mayor of Cambridge. He had observed the manner in which the High Court had been conducted, and he had noticed that although there were differences of opinion they were all one. There had been unity, and notwithstanding the elaborate discussion, which was sometimes very warm, in the midst of councillors there was safety, and anyone could say ""Yea"" or ""Nay."" He hoped they would go on in unity and strength, for ""United we stand, divided we fall."" He would carry back to Africa happy recollections of what he had seen at the Cambridge High Court.

Since then, further details have come to hand, and we learn that this Adeoshun has for some time been regarded as a ""Ju Ju medicine man,"" and had acquired great influence over the females of Lagos, owing to his dealings in ""charms"" and ""fetish."" When the last advices left Lagos, Adeoshun was undergoing a police examination, and so great was the excitement in the place, and particularly among the female portion of the inhabitants, that a force of Houssas had to be specially in attendance at the police-court to protect the accused from the violence of the mob, which numbered some 3,000 people. The first charge against Adeoshun is that of the murder of Mrs. Selina Cole. This lady disappeared very mysteriously some time since, and it was thought that she had been decoyed outside the protectorate and sold into slavery—a circumstance which is stated in the despatch to be not of very unfrequent occurrence. Subsequently the husband of the missing woman became aware that certain property which belonged to his wife was in the possession of Adeoshun. A search warrant being obtained, goods to the value of some £160 were found on the premises of the accused, all of which were said to belong to Mrs. Cole. The matter having been taken up by Inspector Willoughby, of the Houssa police, a bush near the town was searched, resulting in the discovery of four skeletons, and subsequently eight more. The remains of Mrs. Cole were among the number. It is said that the accused, by the aid of his charms, was believed by the females of the colony to be able to bring them wealth. From Mrs. Cole alone we learn that Adeoshun obtained some £500 prior to her disappearance. It is stated that the prisoner induced his victims to meet him in a lonely part of Ikoyi (near where the bodies were found) and there forced them to kneel down with their eyes blindfolded. A live fowl was then put in each hand of the victims, and while in this position it is believed they were despatched by the aid of some heavy weapon.

The General History of Africa emphasizes the variety of crops and agricultural practices across different ecological zones, noting that African agricultural systems were not merely subsistence-based but involved significant exchange and specialization. This supports the notion of a diverse nutritional base, further enriched by the integration of American crops like maize and cassava. However, it also acknowledges challenges such as fragile agricultural systems in regions like Rwanda and the impact of colonial economies that led to monocrop production, potentially limiting dietary diversity.

This is the extent to which it is misleading to persist in describing African agricultural systems as 'subsistence', or sustaining 'natural economies'. These terms were initially justified on the mistaken notion that African rural communities were static, 'tribal', 'selfcontained' or 'almost self-contained.'$^{15}$ As empirical evidence has been gathered to disprove this view of isolated communities, it appears that some protagonists of the view that African agriculture had a subsistence character, while conceding the prevalence of the circulation of goods and services, are now defining subsistence in ideological terms. They claim that African farmers were subsistence farmers, not peasants, on the grounds that though they might have bought and sold, their predominant motive was not profit. They define peasants as 'small agricultural producers who intend to make a living by selling part of their crops and herds', and they consider that peasantization is necessarily the result of 'the impact of new markets' and the profit motive.$^{16}$ What the Tunisian experience highlights is that African agricultural systems in the early nineteenth century were such that the different communities could not be regarded as self-contained. There was a variety of crops according to the variety of soils, family traditions and individual preferences and specialized skills. Crop farming, crafts and animal husbandry went together in a variety of patterns that encouraged exchange as the means by which families made up their essential needs. Each family gave up part of its surplus in return for what it needed but did not produce, and saved the remainder of its produce for years of drought and other calamities."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Agricultural systems', 'content': ""It should be emphasized that at the beginning of the nineteenth century the basis of the economy of all African communities was food production, through a variety of systems of crop farming, rearing of animals, fishing, hunting, or combinations of these.

They tend to be theoretical and ideological, contributing more to the debate about underdevelopment than to an understanding of the historical development of African agriculture in the early nineteenth century.

We shall now endeavour to trace the developments that were taking place during the period under consideration.\nTo the south of the rain-forest, in the vast area of open forest (miombo in Zaire, mato de panda in Angola) that extends to latitude i6-i7°S, nineteenth-century agriculture provided only part of the food supply, for agricultural production was far from being intensive.$^{1}$ This type of farming was the one best suited to the poor soils of the open woodland, but it could only support a population density low by twentieth-century standards (a maximum of 8 per sq km). In the nineteenth century the old-established African cereals - eleusine ('finger millet'), millets and sorghum - still formed the bulk of the crops grown in several of these regions. As a complement to agriculture, food-gathering (nutrition plants, caterpillars, honey, rodents, etc.), hunting and fishing played a major role in the food supply: and even in the twentieth century food-gathering is still very widespread in these open woodland communities.\nSparse populations most commonly did not live in complete isolation. They were in contact with more densely populated areas, which shed their excess population on to the neighbouring territories. In some areas where the space available was very limited (for instance in the immediate vicinity of watercourses), agriculture became diversified and intensified, and led to polarization of the population, often near capital towns or chieftaincy centres."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.598, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo* Basin and Angola', 'section_title': 'Production: models of sparse and dense populations', 'content': 'The chronology of these changes obviously cannot be traced in detail: depending on the region, they might have extended over more than two centuries (1600-1850). This is a rough estimate that can be pinpointed by some landmarks. Around 1800 all the American varieties (maize, cassava, sweet potatoes, beans, etc.) had no doubt not been adopted everywhere in the same way, but no area seems to have ignored them altogether. Moreover in some cases American plants had become so integrated that they were no longer regarded as foreign imports. Thus in the Kongo region we have for the lower Zaire river the first systematic inventory of a Central African flora (Tuckey expedition, 1818), which confirms the widespread use of the American varieties. In the colonial period, a detailed inventory of Kongo agriculture noted that several American imports (groundnuts, sweet potatoes, etc.) were perceived in the oral culture as of local origin as were yams or voandzou.""$^{1}$ Elsewhere, however, proverbs and rites still serve as reminders that the foundation of African agriculture antedated the Amer› ican borrowings in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

But towards the latter part of the eighteenth century a limit seems to have been reached to the capacity of human action to expand resources of land for cultivation and grazing. Population increase, influenced somewhat by the adoption of maize as one of the principal crops in the region, seems to have placed an enormous strain on the customary access to land and related resources. 14 Although the narrow corridor between the Drakensberg Mountains and the Indian Ocean always imposed definite physical limits to the expansion potential of communities living in that area, the northern Nguni chiefdoms did enjoy a number of advantages peculiar to the region. For generations, in fact centuries, they had enjoyed the advantages of a beneficent physical environment which they had learnt to exploit skilfully. In the spring and early summer, Nguni herders could drive their herds to graze on the upland sourveld pastures, and from the middle of the summer season they would move their stock down to the sweet grasses at the bottom of the river valleys. Climatic variations had also made it possible for these farmers to select the environment most suitable for the cultivation of either sorghum, millet or maize. As we now know maize was introduced in that region some time in the eighteenth century and it quickly replaced other traditional food crops as the staple diet. In an area of very good rainfall this substitution of maize as the basic food item may have given a boost to population and thereby increased pressure on the land. This could have contributed to increasing restlessness and violence as the numerous small states in the region began struggling and competing seriously for dwindling resources.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.625, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Peoples and states of the Great Lakes region', 'section_title': 'Coercion, violence and the market', 'content': ""Towards the Winam Gulf area, staple foods were frequently in short supply, particularly in the lake littoral zone affected by a unimodal pattern of rainfall and an extended dry season.

This uplands shift in population continues today. It involves transitions in production and diet among those pressing upland, the compression of population in the higher elevations, and the expansion of Luo-speaking communities. The process of upland migration has produced some of the highest rural population densities in Africa in the twentieth century, contributing to the exhaustion of soil and the depletion of forest and woodland reserves. 19 Those who did not migrate upland continued to suffer the shortfalls of a fragile agricultural system. The occasional markets offered some relief, permitting the exchange of cattle, grazed in the lowlands, for grain and root crops grown more successfully at the higher elevations. Since, in the lowlands, the period of hunger was also the period of heaviest labour demand for cultivating and sowing of grains in the first rains, the occasional markets provided a means of overcoming rather quickly the excessively long dry season or an earlier short harvest.

Maize was known in Kenya in the 1880s but until the end of the century it was important only on the coast,$^{38}$ while it became important in Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi only during the first decades of this century.$^{39}$ Cassava's great spurt was even later. In West Africa its spread was inhibited by inadequate knowledge of how to prepare it and remove all poisons until the Brazilians (Africans returning from Brazil whence they or their ancestors had been transported as slaves) came to the Guinea Coast in the nineteenth century and taught the preparation of gari (cassava meal), which 'seems to have spread from the Brazilian centers to most of the old yam-growing areas, but its expansion has been most rapid since about 1900.'$^{40}$ Cassava has been grown on any scale in Senegal only since 1900 and in Nigeria north of the Niger and Benue not until the 1920s.$^{41}$ All evidence points the same way. Asian rices have largely supplanted indigenous rice, especially in far West Africa, during the last century and the present one; while even the older varieties of cocoyam (taro) were supplemented during the nineteenth century by the introduction of new types from the Pacific. 42 The food historian would note the revolutionary change in diet which has occurred.

This is what happened with the Shi, and in Burundi and Rwanda. Shi agriculture in particular retained several plant varieties from the agricultural system formerly prac¬ tised in the region, such as eleusine, sorghum and taro. However, by the nineteenth century at the latest it had absorbed American crops: an inven¬ tory of twentieth-century Shi farming noted thirty-two varieties of beans and four varieties of sweet potatoes known before the colonial period.10 The nineteenth century was also the period when the Shi developed chiefdoms or small states. P. Gourou and J. Vansina observed in other contexts (Rwanda and Kuba) that political factors can speed up population growth and also intensify production. Higher-yield agriculture is found to be necessary to feed the clients, dependents and captives who concentrate in the capital towns or chiefdoms. This political factor may have operated in the case of the Shi in the nineteenth century.\nIt is, thus, not a one-way process: population growth made possible by the production of increasing surpluses calls in turn for further expansion of production. This sometimes happened at the price of an erosion of political power. In the western part of Zaire there are several examples of areas that became in the nineteenth century population reservoirs fed by heavy immigration; but the power of the chiefs weakened whilst stockpiling by clan or lineage leaders and even by enterprising individuals was what really counted.

Although certain American plants, such as groundnuts, beans and a little maize, were known, American plant varieties had not found their way here to the same extent as in the centre of Angola. Millet and sorghum remained the staple crops, being drought-resistant. Royal power was closely linked to the system of production. The king was the 'rainmaker' and also responsible for sharing out the land and organizing river damming and other irrigation works. 13 As a result of such development, we can say that the long-standing disparities in population distribution were probably accentuated in the nineteenth century. The creation of a surplus from an increase in agri› cultural production led to relatively rapid increase of population in certain areas such as Ovambo, Ovimbundu, Luba, the whole area in Zaire some 5° south of the Equator, etc. This, in turn, led to migratory movements away from other areas. This was further heightened by the varying effects of social and economic factors. Some economic factors encouraged the practice of gathering, such as the collection of ivory and wax by the Chokwe and this promoted the dispersion of people in the forest. Other economic factors, as often happened in river valleys for example, helped bring together a mixed population to create centres of trade and population concentration.

The invasion of wetter, tropical Africa by cultivated crops was less successful, although the locally domesticated yam was rain-tolerant and grew well enough on the forest margins as did the West African variety of rice. Early in the Christian era plants more suited to equatorial Africa, the banana (especially its large non-sweet variety, the plantain) and the Asian yam reached East Africa and slowly spread westward.$^{36}$ But the conquest of the forest was a long slow process and agriculture and population grew slowly within its confines, so slowly indeed that up to the fifteenth century the forested northerly part of the Congo basin seems to have been sparsely occupied by hunters and food-gatherers and considerable areas are still occupied by these people. 37 In terms of demographic history, the important point is that the forest was the home of very few people five hundred years ago. The major exceptions were the fringes, the coast and the important inter-regional routes. For instance in Nigeria an example of the first is the lagoon area either side of Lagos, of the second is Old Oyo, and of the third is both Ife and Benin on the route which crosses the Niger at the lowest point where it is easily accessible and crossable before reaching the delta. Since then the movement into the forest has continued at an accelerating rate and is by no means complete. To take another Nigerian example, and a contemporary one, the opening up of the wet forest south of Ondo (and to the south-east of the massively crowded central Yorubaland) to intensive cultivation has largely been a product of the building of the road from Ijebu Ode to Benin in the early 1960s.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.603, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

This is a variety whose nutritive value and palatability is at its highest soon after the first spring rains and in the early months of the summer season. But the food value and palatability of sourveld grass decreases as it matures. Sourveld, therefore, tends to provide grazing for roughly four months of the year before it begins to lose both its food value and palatability. Sweetveld, on the other hand, tends to be rather more characteristic of the drier parts of the country, where it is usually found in association with scattered trees in savanna vegetation types of which it generally forms the understorey. Although sparse and easily damaged, sweetveld grass retains its palatability and food value throughout the dry season. Sweetveld is therefore particularly important as winter grazing. Between these two extremes of sweet and sourveld grazing can be found transitional belts of mixed veld capable of supporting grazing for some six to eight months in the year. 12 While other parts of Southern Africa such as the areas occupied by the Sotho-Tswana communities of what is now the Transvaal highveld did also have considerable tracts of sweetveld coverage, such areas nevertheless lacked the river system of the northern Nguni area, which ensured that the low rainfall parts of the region had the paradoxical feature of being dry, but well-watered.$^{13}$ Also, on the highveld tracts of sweetveld, pasturage often occurred in association with tsetse fly, which causes sleeping sickness in man and animals alike."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.605, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': 'British tutelage.

The sudden arrival of a large body of persons in a small isolated spot like Cape Coast created well nigh a famine, until the inhabitants, recovering from the first shock of the increased demand for everything, set systematically to work to supply that demand to the best of their ability. There was one description of food, however, that everybody complained there was no getting; in fact, that there was nothing in the shape of greens or green food to be had, either for love or money. This argument—I had rather call it abuse of the country—was supported by one or two other officials that had been in the country upwards of two years.\n\nNow, Mr. Editor, my idea is to give you and your readers the names of a few of the available vegetables and fruits of the earth to be had here merely for the trouble of picking; and others that the natives cultivate, though not to any great extent.

For the use of many of your readers who are resident on the Gold Coast, I have, where practicable, added the Fantee name to the plant mentioned. First, though not foremost, there is the Wild Cabbage (called by the Fantees “Empompo”), the leaves of which make a capital salad, or dressed as greens make a good substitute for the Savoy.

They have very little power of resisting disease, sinking very rapidly. I think they are insufficiently fed; their diet, which is chiefly vegetables, not being sufficiently nutritious. I should say, though many are muscularly strong, they are not a race vitally strong. They are especially prone to inflammation of the lungs, which is very fatal with them. The most common cause of inflammation of the lungs is cold. Violent exercise will make a man more subject to the influences of cold. Poor diet and fatigue would be predisposing causes towards this disease. At this season it is very common in the Military Hospital.

Upon the character of this region science has spent its speculations, and the exploration of it has been the hard work of ages. Africa, in fact, has been the world's huge problem. From Cæsar to Speke, the origin of the Nile has been mankind's greatest puzzle. Unsolved though it be, the attempts to trace it out have been of the greatest service. No longer esteemed a howling wilderness, or a death-stricken morass, the interior of Africa, from the southern border of Sahara down to our own limits, we know to be singularly fertile, and by no means insalubrious. The western shore, north of Walwisch Bay, gives ample evidence that a wealthy country lies beyond—a country rich in minerals and vegetation—blessed in all save the savage races that seal it up from the view of civilization. Going north, we find, near the equator, a tract of splendid hill-land, where the Cameroon Mountains reach to a height of 14,000 or 15,000 feet, and where the climate is so genial, that Captain Burton recommended its fitness for a penal settlement. Here we have come to the most remarkable part of the continent. Beyond the Cameroons extends that vast depression which intersects Africa, at a high altitude, from the equator to the Cape. Then, on the other side of the still unknown territory, we come to the wonderful lake-land, whose inland seas, fringed by the palm-growth of the tropics, are overshadowed by the snowy peaks, and embraced by the crescent arms of the mystic Mountains of the Moon. Here, in what may naturally be regarded as the hottest part of Africa, lying exactly across the equator, is a land which, according to Speke and Grant, is one of the finest in the world. Owing to its height above the sea-level, the climate is singularly pleasant, and is so far from being excessively hot, that Captain Grant walked through the whole of it in woollen clothing, and slept every night between blankets. 750 different specimens brought away by these travellers attest the abundance and variety of the vegetation there. All the necessaries and many luxuries of savage life grow without much effort, and the natives lead an easy and somewhat gluttonous existence, in the rank enjoyment of the many gifts of nature. From all we know, and that recent travellers have told us, the whole of East Africa, between Natal and the equator, bears the same character. Dr. Livingstone has found the cotton plant growing abundantly throughout the valleys and river plains north of the Zambezi. On this side of that river exists a country that is utterly unexplored as yet. On the map this region presents a blank, and a dotted line only marks the supposed course of the Limpopo as it goes to the sea. What is known of this tract, however, and by slow degrees it is being trenched upon, is altogether favourable. The large organised hunting stations which are now established in the Trans-Vaal, sending out yearly many detachments of trained hunters into the adjacent territories, are gradually opening up this darkly hid land, and we hear that recent hunters describe what they have seen of it in most glowing terms. They say that for beauty of aspect and natural fertility it exceeds any of the southern divisions, and the people of Moselekatsc, who rules as the emperor of it, are known to be in advance of the tribes on this side of them. Here, it must be remembered, is the ancient Sofala, presumed to be the Ophir referred to in the Bible, and to this day gold ornaments sometimes reach us through natives who have received them from that mysterious locality.

Circumstances have hitherto prevented my doing so, and I should perhaps have deferred writing about it at present, from the conviction that the materials at my command are insufficient to enable me to give you a report such as a matter of so great importance demands. Considering, however, that you have always more articles for your valuable journal than your space will allow you to publish, I shall try to give you multum in parvo. It has been one of the great aims of the African Times, from its formation, to point out to the rising generation of Africa the fact, that the great wealth of a country depends upon the amount of its agricultural products; and that the immense riches of Africa can never be developed unless its people put their shoulders to the wheel, and perform their part. You have seized upon every occasion to point out the immense advantages to be derived from a systematic pursuit of agriculture, and you have also particularised important and fertile soils at points which might be taken as nuclei, for operation. For instance, you have thus singled out Quiah, at Sierra Leone; the interior countries of the Gold Coast; the lands on the banks of the several rivers on the country of Yoruba, as well as those of the Niger, the mother river of Western Africa, and the great high road to its central territories. At Sierra Leone, the yearly burning of its fields; the excessive amount of iron in the composition of its soil—especially the Peroxide; the practice of upturning that soil yearly from the time of the formation of the colony for sowing purposes, without any external assistance by manure; the imperfect knowledge of the science of agriculture and of chemistry by the farmers, which teaches that the difference in the inorganic ingredients of plants leads them to select different inorganic materials from the soil, and therefore that rotation of crops is essential where manures cannot be obtained—have led its soil to be rightly pronounced as not the most fit for agricultural pursuits. It is therefore highly pleasing to find that his Excellency Governor Blackall is using his influence to popularise the subject amongst the young men of Sierra Leone, and to point out to them the fertile region of Quiah. The lecture lately delivered by the Rev. George Nicol, on the agriculture of that colony, ought to be regarded as a vade mecum for every one. The lands bordering the sea on the Gold Coast are dry and arid, and contain throughout the year but very little moisture. They are rich in phosphate and other inorganic matters, but the uncertainty of rain consequent on the geographic position of the lands forms, in the absence of irrigation, a great barrier to planters. It is to the interior we must therefore look for a field of effectual agricultural operations. The inhabitants of the Eastern Districts, through the indefatigable exertions of the Basle missionaries and Mr. Freeman, are now becoming alive to the advantages of agriculture, and every man of consequence is devoting the best portion of his time to it. In the interior of Cape Coast, or the central portion of the Gold Coast Government, the soil is admirably adapted for sowing any kind of crops. The best is to be found in the regions bordering on the Ashantee frontiers or that of the Fanti. It is there excellent for almost every kind of vegetable, and is rich in inorganic ingredients. It is an argillaceous superficial loam, intermixed with a species of sand formed by the disintegration of quartzose and felspathic rocks. The river communication should make this part the fulcrum for agricultural pursuits. It is needless for me to say a word on the fertility of the Yoruba and Niger soils, as all history goes to prove that they are rich in productive materials.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-04-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1864#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.621, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Capabilities of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Dear Brother in the cause of God and humanity,—The elevation of Africa is near my heart, and anything that promises to aid in rescuing her from her long and deep degradation meets a warm response in my heart.

I rejoice in the success of Dr. Livingston, and of every other explorer and labourer in Africa; but much more need to be and can be done for her. 1. She needs missionaries and teachers, but these alone will not do the work needed. Accompanying them should be (2) farmers and mechanics, who can teach them civilization, for both must go together—civilization and Christianity: either without the other will fail; but both united will, with God's blessing, lift her up, and soon give her a place among the nations.\n\nShe has natural resources abundant. 1. The people are capable of being educated in the arts and sciences, in which they make rapid proficiency when an opportunity is provided. In managing business, mercantile or other, they manifest an ability equal to the whites. The richest men in Sierra Leone are negroes who were taken out of the slave ship.

Rice, Indian corn, and some smaller grains, suited to exportation, can be produced to any extent. Ginger, pepper, arrowroot, can be supplied to meet the wants of the world. Coffee and cotton of fine quality grow wild abundantly, and can be cultivated to any extent to supply Manchester and every cotton factory in Christendom. There only needs to do this to start it all along the Western Coast, and make a market for them, and the natives will go to producing them. They will work at what they can make the most money by. Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down. These things I have seen.\n\n3. And her minerals are rich and abundant. Gold and iron ore, the purest in the world, is very abundant in many parts.

This wild cotton appears to be of the Brazilian variety, of good colour, but short in staple. For cultivation on a large scale it would be advisable to introduce Egyptian seed or some of the better American varieties. Messrs. Swanzy use Egyptian. Besides the fibre, the seeds of the plant may be made a source of profit, either by exporting them as they are or by the expression and exportation of the oil which they contain. Cotton is largely cultivated in the country behind Kumasi, and the yarn worked up into cloth in the country. The silk-cotton tree yields a fibre which is largely imported into Holland from the Indian Archipelago under the name of kapok, and is used for stuffing furniture. The enormous number of silk-cotton trees in the colony would yield a plentiful supply if the people found it worth collecting and exporting, and the timber is used for making fishing canoes.\n\nRice also might be made an important crop on the Gold Coast.

With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.614, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CAPE COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '**Third.**—The plant which yields the **Indigo** of commerce, known to botanists as the Indigo tinctoria and Indigo cærulea.* It is one of the most common shrubs in Western Africa, from Senegal to the Gaboon, and is used extensively by the natives for dyeing purposes.

It is an annual; a shrub of the natural order Compositæ; found principally in hedges and waysides, having a fibro-tuberous rootstem; and a soft, yielding cellular stem, which latter presents a tuber at the inferior portion of each node, occupying a fifth of the internode, observable more in the full-grown stem than in the younger ones. Each tuber is composed of a lot of cells, and when fractured yields a colourless fluid, which, exposed to the air, becomes of a deep blue colour. The leaves are sheathy at the base, opposite, exstipulate, oblong lanceolate, distantly serrated, and when pressed yield a light yellow fluid (which becomes deep blue on exposure to the air) and has a disagreeable odour. The flowers are collected, as in all the compositæ, into dense capitula on a common receptacle; the florets are tubular, and of a whitish colour, having four equal teeth. The fruit is an achene, with erect solitary seed. The blue matter exists in every part of the plant, even in its liochs.\n\n* I beg to call the notice of the Rev.

The seeds of Exogens contain two seed-lobes, which in sprouting become two seed-leaves, as seen in the germinating of peas, beans, cucumber, the mallow, &c. These give cortical fibres, which are contained in their barks. A great number of these fibrous plants are herbaceous, as the mallows, in which is the cotton plant, a large part of the _Urtica_, or nettle family, including the common hemp, the hop, some varieties of the _Leguminosae_, or pea and bean tribe, as the Okra bean. This class of fibres grows in both tropical and temperate regions, whilst Endogens are essentially tropical plants—that is, plants growing only in the tropical regions. On the seed of the Endogen there is only one leaf, as seen in the sprouting of wheat, rice, Indian corn, and the date tree. In the flowers of these two classes of fibrous plants distinctive characters may be observed; but we shall direct attention only to those of the Exogens, in which we may see the flowers composed of stamens and pistils, surrounded on the outside by floral envelopes. Some of these floral envelopes are of two kinds, the outer usually green, and the inside variously coloured, both consisting, occasionally, of several pieces more or less united, as seen in the nettle, the mallow, the Okra, and the cotton plant.\n\nCapsular fibres are, as their name indicates, such fibres as grow in their pods or capsules, as cotton, Mudar floss, Bosbax floss, commonly called silk cotton, and in some parts of the Western Coast of Africa by the natives, called ""wetang e beteng.""

It is a native of Chili, where it has long been cultivated for the sake of its oil, which is of excellent quality. It grows like the aster, the blossom is yellow, and put together in clusters, the stalk is from three to five feet high, grows compact, and requires a sandy soil.

It was introduced from Chili into Asia Minor with great success, thence into Algeria and the South of France, and into some warm parts of Germany, and is said to be more abundant in oil than any plant introduced into Europe. It attracted attention in Europe previously to 1839, in consequence of Mr. Bosch, the superintendent of the gardens of the King of Wirtemberg, having successfully cultivated it in Germany on a large scale. He found that, as compared with rape and poppies, the amount of oil yielded per German acre was as follows:—\n\n- Rape yields . . . 240lbs. oil per German acre.\n- Poppies . . . 264 "" ""\n- Madia . . . 442 "" ""\n\nThis oil does not congeal at 19 deg. below zero of Reaumur, but only becomes a little less fluid, which makes it a valuable material for keeping machines in order.\n\nIn Europe the seeds are sown in October, and from 4 to 6lbs. are required per German acre.

It was through this network that the Swahili country was able to become the first base for colonial penetration into the eastern part of Central Africa.\nThe two other networks that spread across Central Africa were centred around the outposts of European traders on the Atlantic coast: the Por› tuguese centres in Luanda, Benguela and Moçâmedes, or the Dutch, French and English trading stations on the lower Zaire river and along the northern coast of Angola. This latter region relied for its supplies mainly on the Kongo trade and on the river trade. The Kongo trade was itself based on the Kwango-Kwilu communities where Kituba, the Kongo local language, was being widely used.\nThe river trade developed during the second half of the nineteenth century, superseding the old overland routes. The people living along the river, particularly those setded near the Ubangui-Zaire confluence or on the Zaire itself, at the level of the Equator, held exclusive sway over the waterborne trade, as they alone possessed and used canoes.

The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships.

Examples of this process can be found throughout Central Africa, both in societies with and without chiefs. In the rain-forest of the Central Basin, for example, certain traders succeeded in accumulating slaves, arms, copper, etc. For the most part, they were canoe-traders living on the banks of the Zaire river, who had grown rich by the slave trade. Indeed the history of the kingdom of Msiri begins with a series of trading expeditions.\nTowards the middle of the nineteenth century, Sumbwa travellers from what is now Tanzania came to trade with the chiefs of the Lunda, Luba, Aushi, etc. of the Luapula valley and surrounding country. These traders were attracted by ivory, abundant in the region, and copper, worked in the west of the kingdom of Kazembe.

The outcome of all this was not only the commercial unification of Africa and an increase in intra-African contacts, not only a tremendous increase in the number of African entrepreneurs, middlemen and traders, but above all the progressive opening up of the hinterland of Africa to European and Arab/Swahili influence and manufactured goods with the tragic consequences that have been referred to and that will be discussed in greater detail in Volume VII of the Unesco General History.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The Mono-Niger area as the unit of analysis', 'content': ""The area covered by this chapter is the region bounded in the west by the Mono river (the present-day Benin-Togo border), in the east and north by the Niger and in the south by the Bight of Benin (Atlantic Ocean).

Some conjectured that it went into Tanganyika, but I saw that to do so it must run uphill. Others imagined that it might flow into the Atlantic. It was to find out where it actually did go that took me into Manyuema. I could get no information from traders outside, and no light could be obtained from Manyuema within—they never travel, and it was so of old. They consist of petty headmanships, and each brings his grievance from some old feud, and is worse than our old Highland ancestors. Every headman of a hamlet would like to see every other ruling blockhead slain. But all were kind to strangers; and though terrible fellows among themselves, with their large spears and huge wooden shields, they were never known to injure foreigners till slavers tried the effects of gunshot upon them, and captured their women and children. As I could get no geographical information from them, I had to feel my way, and grope in the interminable forests and prairies, and three times took the wrong direction, going northerly, not knowing that the great river makes immense sweeps to the west and south-west. I felt as if I were running my head against a stone wall. It might, after all, turn out to be the Congo; and who would risk being eaten and converted into black man for it? I had serious doubts, but stuck to it like a Briton, and at last found that the mighty river left its westing and flowed right away to the north. The two great western drains, the Lufira and Lomame, running north-east before joining the central line or main river, Lualaba—told that the western side of the Great Valley was high, like the eastern, and as this main is reported to go into large reedy lakes, it can scarcely be anything else but the western arm of the Nile. But, besides all this—which is quite possible I may be mistaken—we have two fountains on, probably, the seventh hundred mile of the watershed, and giving rise to two rivers, the Liambai, or Upper Zambese, and the Kafue, which flow into Inner Ethiopia, and two fountains are reported to rise in the same quarter, and, forming Lufira and Lomame, flow, as we have seen, north. These four full-grown gushing fountains, rising so near each other, and giving origin to four large rivers, answer in a certain degree to the description given of the unfathomable fountains of the Nile by the secretary of Minerva in the city of Sais, in Egypt, to the father of all travelers, Herodotus. But I have to confess that it is a little presumptuous in me to put this forward in Central Africa, and without a single book of reference, on the dim recollection of reading the ancient historian in boyhood. The waters were said to well up from an unfathomable depth, and then part, half north to Egypt and half south to Inner Ethiopia. Now, I have heard of the fountains afore-mentioned so often that I cannot doubt their existence, and I wish to clear up the point in my concluding trip. I am not to be considered as speaking without hesitation, but prepared, if I see reason, to confess myself wrong. No one would like to be considered a disciple of the testy, old, would-be geographer, who wrote \'Inner Africa Laid Open,\' and swore to his fancies until he became blue in the face. The work would all have been finished long ago had the matter of supplies of men and goods not been entrusted by mistake to Banians and their slaves, whose efforts were all faithfully directed towards securing my failure. These Banians are protected English subjects, and by their money, their muskets, their ammunition, the East African Moslem slave trade is mainly carried on. The cunning East Indians secure most of the profits of the slave trade, and adroitly let the odium rest on their Arab agents. The Banians will not harm a flea or a mosquito, but my progress in geography had led me to the discovery that they are by far the worst cannibals in all Africa. They compass, by means of Arab agents, the destruction of more human lives for gain in one year than the Manyuema do for their flesh-pots in ten. The matter of supplies and men was unwittingly committed to these our Indian fellow-subjects, who hate to see me in their slave market, and dread my disclosures on the infamous part they play. The slaves were all imbued with the idea that they were not to follow, but force me back, and after rioting on my goods for sixteen months on the way instead of three, the whole stock of goods was sold off for slaves and ivory. Some of the slaves who came to Manyuema so baffled and worried me, that I had to return between 500 and 600 miles. The only help I have received, except half a supply which I dispatched from Zanzibar in 1868, has been from Mr. Stanley, your travelling correspondent, and certain remains of stores which I seized from the slaves sent from Zanzibar seventeen months ago; and I had to come back 300 miles to effect the seizure. I wait here—Unyanyembe—only till Mr. Stanley can send me fifty free men from the coast, and then I proceed to finish up the geographical part of my mission. I come back to the slavery question, and I am permitted in any way to promote its suppression, I shall not grudge the toil and time I have spent.

The newly-discovered country is rich and fertile, the people friendly, and, what is a matter of surprise as well as of joy, not without a knowledge of religion.

In 1870, Dr. Schweinfurth, travelling up the Gazal, tributary of the White Nile, reached the bank of the westward-flowing Wellé, of which he had heard from the Nubians after leaving Khartoum. His feelings on seeing this river must have resembled those of Mungo Park when he first beheld the Niger. Schweinfurth surmised that the Wellé might be the upper waters of the Binúé, the important river which joins the Niger; but he inclined to the opinion that it is identical with the Shari, flowing into Lake Chad from the south-east. Dr. Junker began his explorations in 1876, and found the sources of the Makua near the Albert Nyanza. In 1880 he returned to the Makua, and explored its basin westward as far as the sareba of Ali Kobo, an Egyptian Government ivory trader. This point is north-west of Stanley Falls. Here the Makua is so colossal a stream that its width is not less than six miles. It includes innumerable islands, some of which are populated by a distinct race, known as the A-Bassongo, who monopolise its navigation, and have canoes sixty-three feet long. Others of the islands are said to be ""full"" of elephants. Dr. Junker learned that westward the Makua was joined by the Kuta, a river flowing from east to west further to the north, and believed to be a branch of the Mobangi. Having no means of navigating the Makua further, and as a voyage would probably have meant fighting, owing to the dissensions fomented by the slave-hunters, Dr. Junker turned back to complete Lupton Bey\'s surveys to the north-east. The news of the capture of Rumbeck by the Mahdi\'s forces induced him to retire and join Emin at Lado. He remained with Emin in the Equatorial Province on the Upper Nile until last year, when he succeeded in negotiating a passage through Uganda, and travelled to Zanzibar, which he reached at Christmas, escorted by a caravan of Tippoo-Tib\'s. Dr. Junker\'s exploration still leaves a doubt as to whither the Makua flowed, though its great width suggested that it could not possibly be the Shari. Does it turn northward to some vast lake, and send only a portion of its waters to Lake Chad? Does it continue westward to feed the Binúé and Niger system? Or does it turn southward and join the Congo? The next link in the chain was supplied by Mr. Grenfell, who, about eighteen months ago, sailed up the Mobangi to a point apparently north of the Makua. The Makua would therefore have to cross the Mobangi in order to continue a westward course. The Mobangi joins the Congo from the north at the point where the latter—if we proceed up the river from Stanley Pool—turns eastward to form its great arc. The Congo is so wide here that its northern bank is not visible from the south shore; and so wide is the Mobangi also, and so sharp the angle at which the two rivers meet, that Grenfell sailed one hundred miles up the Mobangi before he discovered he had left the Congo and was proceeding north-eastward, he knew not whither. Mr. Wills is justified in arguing that when the great size of the Makua is taken into account it seems almost certain that it is identical with Grenfell\'s Mobangi. There is another argument, to which Mr. Wills does not allude. On the old maps which illustrate the explorations of the Portuguese, and notably those of Lopez in 1578, the Zaire or Congo is shown, not only with a great arc resembling that on Stanley\'s map and fed from a lake to the south-east, but also a great north-eastern branch, the course of which is analogous to that indicated as the course of the Makua and Mobangi. And in the account of his explorations and inquiries Lopez tells us that the chief source of the Zaire is ""the same lake from which the Nile flows,"" and that it is also fed by a lake ""formed by the Nile."" These observations are suggestive of the hydrography of the Mutá Nzige and Albert Nyanza region.'}, {'id': 5835, 'article_title': ""Geographical Results of Mr. Stanley's Expedition"", 'full_section_title': ""Geographical Results of Mr. Stanley's Expedition"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/06_05_1889#article-9', 'issue_date': '06_05_1889', 'content': 'Mr. Stanley has addressed an interesting letter to the secretary of the Royal Geographical Society, in which the explorer enters minutely into the geographical results of his expedition, into the character and relations of the different tribes met with, and the nature of the products of one of the most remarkable countries of Africa.

His description of some characteristics of the forest which had to be penetrated is worth quoting. The difficulties ""consisted of creepers ranging from 6in. to 15in. in diameter, swinging across the path in bowlines or loops, sometimes massed and twisted together; also of a low dense bush, occupying the sites of old clearings, which had to be carved through before a passage was possible. Where years had elapsed since the clearings had been abandoned, we found a young forest and the spaces between the trees choked with climbing plants, vegetable creepers, and tall plants. This kind had to be tunnelled through before an inch of progress could be made."" This is the forest through which Livingstone struggled his way in the Manyuema country in the months before Stanley relieved him. Mr. Stanley shows that the region traversed by him is probably the most extensive forest region in Africa, a region resembling the forest region of South America. Mr. Stanley has definitely settled the courses of an important affluent of the Congo and its tributaries; he has defined the southern limits of the Albert Nyanza, and found that it is rapidly decreasing; he has all but established the fact of the existence of a separate lake to the south, which probably drains into the Congo and not into the Nile; and no doubt on his return he will tell us more of the snowy mountain rivalling Kilimanjaro, far away to the south-east of his standpoint on the west shore of Albert Nyanza. It seems clear that the natural outlet of the region around Albert Nyanza is not by the Aruwimi, but eastwards by Victoria Nyanza and British East Africa.

For the last 300 miles of its course, but upward to its source, it has a singular, wide-spreading fame under the name of Ituri. The aborigines of the Nyanza, the open plateau and forest tribes down to within a few miles of the Kepoko, all unite in calling it the Ituri.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Central Africa and its Great Waterways', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have from time to time noted the additions made to our knowledge of the northern tributaries of the great arc of the Congo. In 1870, Dr. Schweinfurth, travelling up the Gazal, tributary of the White Nile, reached the bank of the westward-flowing Wellé, of which he had heard from the Nubians after leaving Khartoum. His feelings on seeing this river must have resembled those of Mungo Park when he first beheld the Niger. Schweinfurth surmised that the Wellé might be the upper waters of the Binúé, the important river which joins the Niger; but he inclined to the opinion that it is identical with the Shari, flowing into Lake Chad from the south-east. Dr. Junker began his explorations in 1876, and found the sources of the Makua near the Albert Nyanza. In 1880 he returned to the Makua, and explored its basin westward as far as the sareba of Ali Kobo, an Egyptian Government ivory trader. This point is north-west of Stanley Falls. Here the Makua is so colossal a stream that its width is not less than six miles. It includes innumerable islands, some of which are populated by a distinct race, known as the A-Bassongo, who monopolise its navigation, and have canoes sixty-three feet long. Others of the islands are said to be ""full"" of elephants. Dr. Junker learned that westward the Makua was joined by the Kuta, a river flowing from east to west further to the north, and believed to be a branch of the Mobangi. Having no means of navigating the Makua further, and as a voyage would probably have meant fighting, owing to the dissensions fomented by the slave-hunters, Dr. Junker turned back to complete Lupton Bey\'s surveys to the north-east. The news of the capture of Rumbeck by the Mahdi\'s forces induced him to retire and join Emin at Lado. He remained with Emin in the Equatorial Province on the Upper Nile until last year, when he succeeded in negotiating a passage through Uganda, and travelled to Zanzibar, which he reached at Christmas, escorted by a caravan of Tippoo-Tib\'s. Dr. Junker\'s exploration still leaves a doubt as to whither the Makua flowed, though its great width suggested that it could not possibly be the Shari. Does it turn northward to some vast lake, and send only a portion of its waters to Lake Chad? Does it continue westward to feed the Binúé and Niger system? Or does it turn southward and join the Congo? The next link in the chain was supplied by Mr. Grenfell, who, about eighteen months ago, sailed up the Mobangi to a point apparently north of the Makua. The Makua would therefore have to cross the Mobangi in order to continue a westward course. The Mobangi joins the Congo from the north at the point where the latter—if we proceed up the river from Stanley Pool—turns eastward to form its great arc. The Congo is so wide here that its northern bank is not visible from the south shore; and so wide is the Mobangi also, and so sharp the angle at which the two rivers meet, that Grenfell sailed one hundred miles up the Mobangi before he discovered he had left the Congo and was proceeding north-eastward, he knew not whither. Mr. Wills is justified in arguing that when the great size of the Makua is taken into account it seems almost certain that it is identical with Grenfell\'s Mobangi. There is another argument, to which Mr. Wills does not allude. On the old maps which illustrate the explorations of the Portuguese, and notably those of Lopez in 1578, the Zaire or Congo is shown, not only with a great arc resembling that on Stanley\'s map and fed from a lake to the south-east, but also a great north-eastern branch, the course of which is analogous to that indicated as the course of the Makua and Mobangi. And in the account of his explorations and inquiries Lopez tells us that the chief source of the Zaire is ""the same lake from which the Nile flows,"" and that it is also fed by a lake ""formed by the Nile."" These observations are suggestive of the hydrography of the Mutá Nzige and Albert Nyanza region.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1887#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo Region and its Great Waterways', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The detailed accounts of Lieutenant Wissmann's recent explorations in that portion of the Congo basin which lies within the bend of the river will necessitate further important modifications in our maps of the hydrography of the African interior. Hitherto the rivers of the southern portion of the Congo basin have been supposed to run from south to north, and are thus represented on all recent maps, including those of the International Association and the map in Stanley's latest book. The latest explorer, Wissmann, however, has found that they run rather in an east to west direction. It is noteworthy that his discoveries confirm in several respects the hydrography of Cameron's map, some of the details of which will have to be restored to the place from which they have lately been erased. To this portion of the Congo basin German explorers have given special attention. In 1870 Pogge and Buchner succeeded in establishing friendly relations with the King of Lunda, the region lying to the east of Angola and now included in the Congo Free State. Subsequently Pogge and Wissmann founded a station in the Mukenge territory, near the upper waters of the Kassai, a considerable river apparently flowing northward, and supposed to be the Buruki Mohindu, or Black River, which falls into the Congo at Equator Station. Wissmann returned to Germany in 1883, but next year was sent out by the International Association. Landing at Loanda, he started for the interior via Malange. Here he met Pogge, who was returning sick to the coast, where he shortly afterwards died. In July, Wissmann continued his journey with a force of 500 men, and crossing the Kuango (now an important highway for Portuguese trade), succeeded in reaching Mukenge Station. After spending some time here to await the arrival of an expedition sent from the German African Society under Lieutenant Schulz, he launched his steel boat on the Kassai, and proceeded on a northward voyage; but, to his astonishment, he found the river suddenly turned to the west. No hindrance to navigation presented itself, and eventually he entered the Congo at Kwamouth Station, a little above Stanley Pool, instead of at Equator Station, about 250 miles further north. At the point where the Kassai turned westward he found it received a great river, which he identified as the Sankuru, the river previously met with in the neighbourhood of Nyangwe, far to the east, and which is actually visited from the East Coast by Arab traders and slave dealers. Moreover, in due time he came upon a great lake, which, by the light of his newly acquired knowledge, he identified as the Lake Sankuru of Cameron, and the Lake Leopold of Stanley. Thus the Sankuru, flowing west from the neighbourhood of Nyangwe, with its continuation the Kassai, forms a great east and west watercourse connecting the neighbourhood of Stanley Pool with the vicinity of Lake Tanganyika. On Stanley's map the Kassai and the Sankuru appear as two distinct rivers, running from south to north, and falling into the Congo north of the equator—the former, as already stated, near Equator Station, and the latter far to the east, in the vicinity of Stanley Falls. On Cameron's map the general direction is correctly shown, and the latitude also is approximately correct; the Sankuru, however, appears as the Lualaba, and the lake of that name is placed too much to the east. Further surprises may yet be in store for us, and it would therefore be hasty to assume that other approximations to Cameron's map and nomenclature may not be necessary."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1885#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE CONGO FREE STATE', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Mobangi, Losaka, Loika, and Maringa rivers, besides other smaller tributaries of the Congo; thus extending our knowledge in various directions for a distance of at least 1,500 miles. As an account of these discoveries has already been published, I shall allude to them very briefly. The most important of these rivers is the Mobangi. Mr. Grenfell ascended it as far as 4° 30' N. latitude. As he proceeded northward, he perceived certain differences in the natives, as compared with those he was accustomed to on the Congo. These latter are known by the generic name of Bantu, while the Mobangi native appeared to have characteristics similar to the natives of the Cameroons and the Gold Coast, which properly belong to the Fan tribe. As these rivers are explored, and the border lands of these two great nations, the Bantu and Fan, become better known, an interesting study will be afforded to the ethnologist. A little beyond 4° N. lat., Mr. Grenfell had to return, but not before he had ascertained that the course of the Mobangi tended to the eastward. Now the size and the volume of this tributary of the Congo prove it the offspring of many waters, while its direction points that it may have its origin in the Niam-Niam and Mangbattu countries; in fact, that it is the Makua or Welle of Schweinfurth. It is always satisfactory when the disjointed discoveries of a great river are connected by a complete survey, and the unknown becomes the known. Let us hope this will soon be the case with the Mobangi, and whether it proves to be the Welle, or whether it has its origin in the territory lying to the north of the Congo, either problem will be most interesting from a geographical point of view, for if the former, it will complete the work begun by Schweinfurth; if the latter, it will add to our knowledge a portion of Africa hitherto unexplored.\n\nA German expedition under the auspices of the Berlin Geographical Society, composed of Lieuts. Schmidt, Kauntz, and Dr. Buchler, reached the Congo in the autumn of 1884. Since their arrival, they have been at work in the country between Stanley Pool, San Salvador, and the Quango. Dr. Buchler, striking the Quango near *Matundo*, followed the unexplored portion of that river to its junction with the Kasai, and thus arrived at Kimpopo, at the upper end of Stanley Pool. At one place his little party were threatened by a hostile demonstration, but when the natives learned that he was going to Bula Matari, their opposition ceased, and he was allowed to pass on without molestation.\n\nIn addition to these efforts, mention should be made of the work done in the Ogowé basin and in the country north of that river by the French, and I have no doubt M. de Brazza will shortly furnish information on this subject."", 'last_edit_date': '1886-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1886#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'An Expedition to the Sources of the Congo', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Congo Commercial Company, who have already done much to open up the Upper river and its affluents, have decided to send out a fresh expedition for the purpose of attempting the solution of the remaining problems connected with the remote feeders of the great river. A glance at a map will show that towards the south-east the territories of the Congo Free State are bounded on the east by three lakes—Tanganyika, Moero, and Bangweolo—and dotted from south to north by a series of smaller lakes among which are those of Lohemba and Upamba. These latter lakes, more or less conjectural, seem to constitute the reservoirs of the Congo. The main stream is formed, so far as is known at present, of three main branches: (1) the Lualaba, which some regard as the principal, and which comes from the south-west, forming on the map a chain of lakelets, of which only two have been seen—by Cameron and Reichard; (2) the Luapula, of which the Chambesi is the upper course, and which traverses Lakes Bangweolo and Moero, discovered by Livingstone; (3) the Lukuga, which issues from Lake Tanganyika and flows direct westwards. According to information obtained from natives and Arab traders, these three rivers unite at a common centre, where the waters form a large lake, known as Lanji, which no white traveller has seen. The country of Urua, on the west of Tanganyika, into which the expedition will penetrate, has just been touched by one or two explorers. Among them are Capello and Ivens, Reichard and Arnot, all of whom speak in glowing terms of the fertility of the region, of its salubrity, and its richness in minerals. It lies so high and is so cold sometimes as almost to freeze. It is a region on which it is desirable to have full information, in the interests of both commerce and geography. It has been stated that Mr. Stanley is likely in the future to undertake a special mission to the Upper Congo. However that may be, it is to be hoped that the Congo Company will carry out their intentions; there is plenty of room here for several expeditions. The proposed expedition will be under the command of M. Alexandre Delcommune, who has already done good work in exploring some of the Congo tributaries, and has been seventeen years on the river. He will be accompanied by Lieut. Hackanson, of the Swedish army, formerly one of the agents of the Congo Free State; Dr. Briart; Lieut. Santsschoff, formerly of the Russian army; Baron Marcel de Roert; M. Norbert Didderich, an engineer; and M. Protsch. MM. Hackanson, Briart, and Santsschoff have already sailed; M. Delcommune leaves on July 6; and M. Didderich on the 3rd. The escort will consist of 150 native soldiers. The expedition will meet at Kiachassa about the middle of September, and embarking on the steamer Roi des Belges, will proceed by the Upper Congo and its tributary, the Lomami, to the limit of navigation on the latter river, nearly opposite Nyangwé. Thence the expedition will proceed on foot. It will be absent from twelve to eighteen months.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1890#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MR.

The river Welle was first discovered in 1870, by Dr. Schweinfurth, on his journey to the Niam-Niam country. The Ubangi, or Mobangi, was first seen by Captain Haussens, in 1884, and after the exploration of the river in 1885-86, by Mr. Grenfell, M. Wauters started the theory of the two rivers being one and the same. On October 13, 1886, Captain Vangele entered the Ubangi in a flat-bottomed scale, and on the next day came in view of the French post, Kundja. Having described the country traversed from this point by the explorer, he said the hostility of the Yakomas made it impossible for him to proceed as far as the Falls of Kissanghi, and the party reached Leopoldville on February 13 last year. Subsequently, at the request of the Governor-General, Captain Vangele proceeded to Stanley Falls with an expedition, which had been for the time being delayed by the Commander, Captain Vandevelde.\n\nSir George Bowen inquired for the latest news from Stanley, and where he is now supposed to be.

It has hitherto been supposed that Stanley Falls formed the extreme limit of practical communication with Central Africa. The Lomami, which joins the Congo very near the Falls, had as yet only been explored for a short distance by Grenfell. Wissmann had certainly crossed it higher up at a navigable point, but it still remained a question whether it was uninterruptedly navigable as far as this point. If it was so, the Lomami, running in about the same direction as the Congo itself above the Falls, would evidently become the highway to the area called Katanga and Ouroua, inaccessible by the Congo itself owing to the 75 miles of cataracts which bar communication beyond the Falls. Katanga is a country rich in mineral resources; copper and gold appear to abound. Its high level, moreover, renders it habitable for Europeans. Ivens, the Portuguese explorer, says: ""Situated at about 1,400 metres (read yards) above the sea-level and refreshed by the south-east breezes, this country deserves serious study, for it is beyond doubt that Europeans can settle and live there."" Cameron and Reichardt have spoken in similar terms of it. North of it lies Ouroua, which was crossed in 1874, by Cameron, who extolled its richness and had evidence of the presence of silver in the district. North of Ouroua and between Lake Tanganyika and the inaccessible Congo lies Manyema, which Livingstone has called the garden of Africa. All this country was considered beyond the pale of practical calculations till February last, when M. Delcommune, an agent of the Congo Railway Exploration Company, ascended the Lomami in the Roi des Belges, and has just added upwards of 900 kilometres (about 540 miles) to the navigable Congo in the direction of the districts of Ouroua and Katanga. At 4 deg. 20 min. of southern latitude M. Delcommune was obliged to turn back, owing to the health of his companion, but he had not yet reached the limit of navigation of the Lomami. The average breadth of the river, he reports, is 250 metres, and its depth 3½ to 5½ metres, with an easy current of 2½ to 3 miles an hour. The population along its banks is dense. From the Lomami to Nyangwe is a march of three days, and from there to Lake Tanganyika the route lies through the beautiful Manyema. It is to be hoped that no time will be lost in further ascending the Lomami.

G. Grenfell. Details are now to hand from Mr. Grenfell, which prove what an admirable piece of exploring work he has done. He shows that the Mobangi, which enters the right bank of the Congo between 26\' and 42\' S. lat., nearly opposite Equator Station, is probably its greatest tributary. Certainly it offers a much longer waterway that any affluent that has been explored. Mr. Grenfell navigated the Mobangi in the little steamer Peace from the equator to 4° 30\' N. lat., and left it still an open waterway. At 4° 23\', N. just below the second rapids he found it 673 yards wide; at no point lower was it less in width. The mean depth is 25\' feet, and although the current runs not more than 80 or 100 feet per minute, it means an immense volume of water to find running south at a point, as Mr. Grenfell puts it, so near the supposed source of the Binué, the great affluent of the Niger. Where does it all come from? he asks, the ""trumbashes"" of the Chad basin are common, while they are not known on the Congo. The opinion of Mr. Grenfell is that the Mobangi is probably the lower part of the Welle, a river whose course is one of the unsolved problems of African geography. This is certainly a more likely solution than to connect the Welle with the Aruwime. Dr. Junker, the Russian explorer, did not follow the Welle so far west as either to confirm or disprove Mr. Grenfell\'s conjecture. It would seem that the Mobangi is navigable a distance of probably 400 to 450 miles, taking account of the bends. A large map, in ten sheets, of the explored part of the river has lately been received at the Royal Geographical Society, which may be expected to appear in an early number of the Society\'s proceedings. The Mobangi, Mr. Grenfell writes, is far more populous than any equal length of the Congo, and to his mind the country is more promising. The people are wild, and he was the first white man they had seen. In ascending the river Mr. Grenfell met with many difficulties from the hostilities of the natives, and had it not been for energetic action he and his party would probably have come to grief. His way down the river was most encouraging; plenty of food and not a sign of hostility. He hopes to make the trip again, and has no doubt that he will be able to report peaceable and friendly receptions everywhere. He may also be able to penetrate further towards the valley of the Shari, the great tributary of Lake Chad. Unfortunately, Mr. Grenfell states, the confluence of the Mobangi with the Congo is just within French territory, though it is not so represented on the map in Mr. Stanley\'s last book or on the latest map of the Royal Geographical Society. Immediately after Mr. Grenfell\'s return to Stanley Pool, M. de Brazza left Brazzaville, to examine for himself the great waterway discovered by the English missionary, and possibly to follow it farther. If so, we are sure to hear of his ""great journey of discovery."" The commercial importance of Mr. Grenfell\'s discovery cannot be exaggerated. Whether the Mobangi is the Welle or not, it must form an important connecting link between the basin of the Congo and the basins of the Niger, the Shari, and the Nile. Mr. Stanley has always maintained that the region between the Congo and the Nile is probably the richest and most promising in Africa, and his belief seems likely to be amply confirmed. Besides the Mobangi, Mr. Grenfell has explored 300 miles of river-courses debouching into the Congo, and, as he is a trained and careful surveyor, he will be able to define them with great precision.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1885#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Exploration on the Upper Congo', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'To the north of the Congo again, news received from Captain Van Gèle leads us to believe that he has been able to fill up the gap between the river Mobangi and the river Wellé which is all that was wanted to prove that the two rivers are one.

According to the telegram from Paris, the right, or west, bank of the river belongs to France, the middle of the stream marking the boundary. The point is, how far does France ascend the river in this way? If only to the original 1 deg. N. lat., she has not gained much. It would be preposterous to suppose that France claims the whole of the right bank of the Mobangi Wellé as far as the source of the latter in the neighbourhood of Lake Albert Nyanza. Both Germany and England would have a word to say as to such an arrangement, as also those who have provided the funds for the expedition to Emin Pasha.

Its transport down the Mobangi will be far easier, and cheaper. ""Take away the ivory, turn a lucrative trade from Khartoum to the Congo, and the great incentive to slave-hunting and slave wars is gone."" The power of the Soudan rebels is broken; what will be the position of the slave-hunting tribes of the Soudan if they are approachable from the rear through a country peopled by natives—the Zandehs—who are eager for protection under European administrators, and whose countrymen are the soldiers who have helped Emin to hold out so long? No part of Africa offers a more interesting study to the scientific explorer. Readers of Dr. Schweinfurth will remember the Monbuttus of the region where the Makua rises, their king Mutnza, with his vast hall, and the highly developed political system which gave to their cannibalism something of the character of civilization. Not less remarkable are the Zandehs lower down the river, and the tribes which inhabit its islands and banks still further west. Should the Mobangi prove to be the Makua, the importance of the treaty by which the Free State has extended the boundary of French territory on the west bank of the Congo to a line drawn down the middle of the Mobangi will be vastly increased, as it may enable the French to tap the trade of the whole of the district south-east of Lake Chad to the district of the Nyanzas. Should the Makua be the upper waters of the Shari, the Royal Niger Company is not unlikely to enjoy similar advantages. It is possible, even in the other event—that is, if the Makua joins the Mobangi— that the Royal Niger Company may be able to approach by the Binúé or other rivers close to this magnificent highway to north-eastern Africa. In that case much would depend upon how far France might extend her claim to the north bank. In the settlement of this question Germany will demand to be heard, as the region lies at the back of the Cameroons.

If Mr. Stanley had simply gone down the Congo, and said it was a great river running towards the Equator, and had never done anything towards bringing its commercial capabilities into view, that would not have been commercial geography. But the great work of the International Association was the establishment of stations to be ports of refuge for traders, explorers, and missionaries at different positions in Africa.

Now Mr. Stanley and M. de Brazza have found routes which, when opened up, will bring trade into the navigable portions of the Congo. When once you are on the navigable portions of the Congo, you can go up to Stanley Falls, and on to Stanley Pool, or you can go on to Lake Moero, and to Lake Bangweolo. You can actually get into the Chambesi, and, with very few breaks, this great water system is open. The Lualaba and other rivers there will all be opened to small steamboats, and it is by those that the commerce and manufactures of Europe will be spread over an area which is one of the biggest areas to conceive as a new market.

Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'.

The Phoenicians treated the part of Africa which they colonised as the British would, as the foundation of trade and commerce. The Phoenicians were followed, about 650 B.C., by the Greeks, who founded their first African colony Cyrene, on the coast of Tripoli. Then came the Carthaginians. They and the Greeks carried on a busy commerce all along the Mediterranean coast, far down to the Atlantic coast, to the mouth of the Red Sea. These were followed by the Romans, who continued an active career on the African coast until the decay of the Roman Empire.\n\nMr. Scott Keltie showed how little was known of the interior of Africa up to 150 A.D. by Ptolemy\'s map being thrown on to the sheet in the darkened theatre. This map, which was filled up haphazard fashion, gathered up, the lecturer said, all the knowledge of the continent which had accumulated during this long period of commercial activity — a knowledge which amounted to very little beyond the coasts and the Nile Valley. The next important period dealt with was the period of Arab invasion and the spread of the tenets of Mohammedanism — namely, from the seventh to the fifteenth century. In the early part of the fifteenth century commenced the ""glorious"" period of Portuguese activity, which lasted for some sixty years, during which the contour of the coast of Africa was completely laid down. This began the real modern partition of Africa, and the lecturer dwelt upon the effect which could be traced to Portuguese occupation of African territory — that occupation being marked by ruin rather than by enterprise. He rapidly traced the occupation of points of territory by Portuguese, Spanish, French, English, Dutch, Danish, and Germans, whose commerce was in ivory and slaves. He held that the opening up of the continent of Africa might be said to have begun with Bruce\'s travels in Abyssinia in the latter part of the eighteenth century. From that time until 1850 nearly the whole map of Africa became gradually filled up, and from 1850 down to the present day the southern half of the continent had received increasing attention at the hands of explorers until it also had had its main features laid down.

Nor did Christianity seem to have extended her light far toward the centre, west or south of Egypt. Her benefits, spread over the north, disappeared here under the effects of disastrous wars. To Mohammedanism was reserved the task of effecting a change in Central Africa. The fanatic Arab mounted on the active dromedary, or embarked in light vessels, flew to plant the standard of his Prophet on the banks of Senegal and on the shores of Sofala. No people ever possessed such qualifications for conquering and preserving the empire of Africa. Among the Mauritanians and Numidians they found natural friends and brothers, and identity of manners, food, and genial climate. The fanatic Mussulman spirit astonished and subdued the ardent imaginations of the Africans; the simplicity of their creed suited their limited intellect, and easily connected itself with the superstition of fetishism, and the ideas which these people entertained of magic and enchantments. Civil slavery and despotic government suffered no change, except that the Maraboots, or Mussulman priests, and the shorifs, or descendants of the Prophet, formed in some of the states a species of aristocracy. Cannibalism was alone abolished. One event for a moment favoured the civilisation of the Moors—the expulsion of those of their number who had ruled in Spain, peopled Barbary, and even the oasis of the great desert with a more industrious and better-informed race than the rest of the Mohammedans. But unhappily for Africa, a handful of Turkish adventurers, vying with one another in ferocity and ignorance, established themselves on the coast of Barbary, subdued the Moors, and founded the barbarous governments of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, forming a deadly barrier to the civilised world, more efficient than Mohammedanism itself.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1866#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.621, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE AFRICAN PROBLEM', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In the fifteenth century the Congo country was the scene of extensive operations.

They knew then as much of interior Africa as is known now after the great exploits of Livingstone and Stanley. There is a map in the Vatican, 300 years old, which gives the general physical relief and the river and lake systems of Africa with more or less accuracy; but the Arab geographers of a century before had described the mountain system, the great lakes, and the course of the Nile. Just about the time that Portugal was establishing a great empire on that continent, America was discovered, and it became the seat of Portuguese Power. Neither Egyptian, Carthaginian, Persian, or Roman influence was allowed to establish itself on that continent. It would seem that no solution of the African problem was to come from alien sources. Africans were not to share the fate of other dark races who have come in contact with the European. Europe was diverted to the Western Hemisphere. The energies of that conquering race were spent in building up a home for themselves on this side. Africa followed in chains.\n\nThe Negro race was to be preserved for a special work in the future. It is probable that if foreign races had been allowed to enter their country they would have been destroyed. So they were brought over to be helpers in America and at the same time to be preserved. Slavery would seem to be a strange school in which to preserve a people; but God has a way of salting as well as purifying by fire. The Europeans found in America an aboriginal race unable to co-operate with them in the labours required for the construction of the new civilisation. The Indians would not work, and have suffered the consequences of that indisposition: they have passed away. To take their place as accessories in the work to be done, the African was brought, who could work and would work, and could endure the climatic conditions of a new southern country, which Europeans could not. If Europe brought the Negro, Africa furnished the hands for the work which has been achieved. But when the new continent was opened Africa was closed.

Never yet has the future of Africa been so full of hope and light. Here, too, there is a north and a south struggling—not for supremacy over each other, but for the regeneration of a continent. In Algeria the French are fast displacing the torpid vestiges of Moorish sway, and are transforming a fertile and healthful country into a lesser France. Where the Moslem, for five centuries, forbade Christian foot to land—where, under the cold shade of the crescent, man has so long wrapt the earth in lethargy—not far from where heathenism crouched under Carthaginian ramparts—on the very spot where a power that imperilled Europe and conquered Spain, held rule thereafter—a prosperous Christian community, great in every element of strength, is now established. Within twenty years this French colony has so grown and prospered, that it is now the home of 200,000 Europeans, consumes seven millions sterling of imports, and ships three millions sterling in the form of exports, such as corn, tobacco, cattle, fruit, oil, and minerals. That the French influence in Algeria is for good, cannot we think be disputed. From the coast to the confines of the Sahara that vigorous and vivacious people are imparting to North Africa quite a different character, and are literally making the wilderness blossom like the rose. But a yet more interesting work goes on in Egypt. Capital is flowing there from Western Europe in marvellous measure. Vast have been the benefits and the material wealth secured to Egypt by the fact of its being the highway to the East, they are as nothing compared with the blessings that are about to be conferred on it by the interposition of foreign influence, and the growing discernment and wider knowledge of those who rule Egypt. Possessed of a soil of perennial richness, calling for little culture, and naturally irrigated, the valley of the Nile, which is as prolific now as it was in Pharaoh's time, is already yielding largely in cotton and corn. Tenacious though the people may be of old customs and traditions, much of their dogged Orientalism is breaking down before the resistless forces of the age—the constant friction caused by the ever-flowing stream of western life that permeates Egypt. We say nothing of the gigantic canal scheme, which, whether it fails or succeeds—and in the interests of our common progress we hope for the latter—has enriched Egypt by the expenditure in it of millions of money. The extraordinary extension of cotton culture there—the rapid covering of the soil by a most valuable crop—the establishment of mills and factories for the better manipulation of local products—the commencement of steam traffic down the Nile, and the probability that before long a railway traversing the valley where as yet the shades of Thebes, of Karnak, and of Abou Simbel have had the desert in all its grim silence to themselves—will penetrate into Abyssinia, not only draining of their natural wealth those lower districts, but tapping the yet more varied fields that lie beyond—these are but some of the onward symptoms that are making Egypt a great power for good, and that will exercise a most beneficent pressure upon the savage kingdoms of the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1865-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1865#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.571, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE PARTITION OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In concluding, he said that he had laid before them what had been done during the past 3,000 years by the various great Powers who had had dealings with Africa for its geography, commerce, and civilisation.

The women were by no means beautiful. Their features were coarse; they had broad noses, large mouths, prominent teeth, and many of them had a forbidding look, which was caused by lowering the eyebrows. Morality was at a very low ebb.

The General History of Africa does not specifically address the Soninkees, their agricultural contributions, or their spiritual practices, instead focusing on the broader complexity and diversity of African societies, which provides a contextual backdrop for understanding the Soninkees' potential economic and cultural roles. In contrast, The African Times offers a more direct, albeit mixed, portrayal of the Soninkees. The articles acknowledge their involvement in agriculture, suggesting some level of economic contribution, yet they also emphasize perceptions of laziness and a warlike nature, which complicates the narrative of significant economic impact. Furthermore, the Soninkees are described as living in simple huts and not prioritizing wealth, aligning with the claim of cultural divergence from wealth-focused societies. Their spiritual practices, such as worshiping alligators and stones and performing human sacrifices, underscore a complex spiritual structure, partially supporting the claim of a unique societal framework. Thus, while the textbook provides a general context, the news articles offer specific insights that both support and challenge the claim regarding the Soninkees' economic and cultural contributions.","The provided paragraphs from the General History of Africa textbook do not specifically mention the Soninkees, their contributions to the local economy through agriculture, or their spiritual practices and societal structure. The text discusses various African societies, their agricultural systems, trade networks, and cultural practices, but it does not provide details about the Soninkees or address perceptions of laziness and warlike tendencies associated with them. This absence of information on the Soninkees is a notable difference, as the claim focuses on their economic contributions and cultural uniqueness, which are not covered in the textbook excerpts. The text does, however, highlight the complexity and diversity of African societies, their economic activities, and cultural practices, which could be relevant to understanding the broader context in which the Soninkees might be situated.","The African Times news articles provide a nuanced view of the Soninkees that both supports and refutes the claim.

This is the extent to which it is misleading to persist in describing African agricultural systems as 'subsistence', or sustaining 'natural economies'. These terms were initially justified on the mistaken notion that African rural communities were static, 'tribal', 'selfcontained' or 'almost self-contained.'$^{15}$ As empirical evidence has been gathered to disprove this view of isolated communities, it appears that some protagonists of the view that African agriculture had a subsistence character, while conceding the prevalence of the circulation of goods and services, are now defining subsistence in ideological terms. They claim that African farmers were subsistence farmers, not peasants, on the grounds that though they might have bought and sold, their predominant motive was not profit. They define peasants as 'small agricultural producers who intend to make a living by selling part of their crops and herds', and they consider that peasantization is necessarily the result of 'the impact of new markets' and the profit motive.$^{16}$ What the Tunisian experience highlights is that African agricultural systems in the early nineteenth century were such that the different communities could not be regarded as self-contained. There was a variety of crops according to the variety of soils, family traditions and individual preferences and specialized skills. Crop farming, crafts and animal husbandry went together in a variety of patterns that encouraged exchange as the means by which families made up their essential needs.

The boundary between the two was never clear-cut, and allowed for movement both ways. In particular, scholars and slaves could be associated with either category.

Within two generations, there developed a network of social and cultural relation› ships through which goods and services circulated with remarkable efficiency. New migrants like the mukama Womunafu and his entourage brought a stock of goods, skills and new technologies; the demand for specialized goods like ironware, especially farming implements, pottery and salt led to occasional fairs to which people brought their surplus produce such as barkcloth, skins and live animals in exchange; others took their produce to the locations of known specialist craftsmen like blacksmiths, fishermen and potters. Similarly, goods and services circulated through payments for rituals and worship, or in payment of bride price and other social dues, and even in raiding, stealing and kidnapping. As Cohen has put it, his study \'offers a series of images of a regional economy of the unadministered zone in the early nineteenth century structured not upon the ""channeled effect"" associated with international and interregional trade but structured, rather, upon a remarkably extensive and thickly knit network of circulation, distribution and redistribution."" 9 The nineteenth century brought changes, new pressures and oppor› tunities even for the people in Bunafu, as in other places. As the family expanded, land hitherto regarded as marginal began to be cultivated. New crops hitherto regarded with caution were experimented with and some became new staples. The \'economic horizon\' of the villagers expanded as the trame strengthened the links that stretched from the villages to the coastal ports and overseas markets. Expansion of trade brought social and political changes. Initially, it tended to strengthen the position of chiefs who found it easier to accumulate wealth from taxing trade in salt, iron and copper, not to mention ivory, beeswax and palm oil, than from tribute in agricultural produce and customary labour. At the same time the profits of trade could not be so easily monopolized. Several individuals moved away from their customary locations to seek their fortunes, and social mobility was thus facilitated. But these changes were slow and represented not so much innovation as expansion of tendencies and patterns already evident by the eighteenth century.

Societies organized according to descent may resolve internal con› flict without recourse to central authority if the power of segments at an appropriate level in the genealogical structure is in balance, and the history of these societies often exhibits this mechanism in operation. But history also demonstrates that segments may unite to face an outside threat, and that military exigency may even give rise to something resembling central authority. Sedentary or semi-sedentary people have often assimilated nonkin who migrated to their territory, and in these societies residence in the same territory may replace kinship as a principle of association. Even societies that are organized according to descent may have leaders or councils at various levels in the segmentary structure or distributed throughout it; wealthy men may attract followers who are not kin; or alliances may contradict or partially offset the notion of kinship as a determinant of allegiance.\nAnother similarity among Saharan people was hierarchical social struc- ture, a consequence of the power of warriors to concentrate wealth so as to reinforce their own position of dominance.

Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses.

There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways.

In the case oimacumba, attention should be drawn to the presence of Amerindian values, the acculturation here being of a threefold variety.\nExamples of syncretism involving Amerindian culture can be seen in the West Indies, particularly in Honduras, where a mestizo people has emerged as the result of interbreeding between Amerindian women and Africans referred to as black Caribs.$^{73}$ These Africans were the descendants of the Igbo and Efik and, subsequently, of the Fante, Asante, Fon and Congo.\nThe 'African societies' gradually turned into 'black societies', varying in the strength of their connection with Africa and in their integration in society as a whole, in the sense of gaining full citizenship.\nFrom the social standpoint, integration in society as a whole was keyed to the following variables: the type of society of the white colonizer; the form of land exploration; the religion of the colonizer - Protestant or Catholic; the percentage of Amerindians in the population and the degree of integration in the economic process imposed by the regime of the colonizer, either during the colonial period proper or following the attain› ment of independence by the Americas."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.601, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 486, 'article_title': ""RIVER GAMBIA: MAHABA'S AFFAIRS"", 'full_section_title': ""RIVER GAMBIA: MAHABA'S AFFAIRS"", 'last_edit_date': '11-10-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1864#article-1', 'issue_date': '23_12_1864', 'content': ""Sir,—I have read the document published in your paper about Mahaba. His worshippers seem to have forgotten what atrocities he had committed. The reason why they are opposed to the Soninkee Government was, that at certain times the people generally came to the factors and begged or demanded certain articles from them, and if refused in an obstinate manner, they considered it an insult to them, as the factors were occupying the ground of their fathers. The affray then generally terminated by the traders receiving a good flogging, and being made to pay a larger demand. I do not wonder at this being complained of; but if the traders were polite and obliging to them, and showed them that the goods did not really belong to the traders, at the same time making them small presents, they generally returned double the amount in a few days in cattle.\n\nWhen Badiboo was under the Soninkee Government, traders from every part of the country came down to trade in it, as it is situated near the large and populous kingdom of Salom. At Badiboo are the best cotton and phangs, numerous bandy cloth, and an immense quantity of ground-nuts; so much so, that Badiboo, under the government of the Soninkees, produced more nuts than any other kingdom on the River Gambia. The principal ground-nut marts were Swarak, Cindah, Bany, Kintak Cundah, and Sabaj. In these towns kola are sold in great abundance for phangs, and afterwards exchanged for ground-nuts, from which the petty traders derive great benefit.\n\nThe people at Badiboo are an intermixture of Jollof, Mandigo, and Foolahs, and from them the people at Bathurst receive yearly several head of cattle, with some fresh butter, corn, and rice. Although the Soninkees are universally considered to be lazy, yet still the lower class are hard-working, and when a Soninkee chief has rule over Marabouts, it is his general practice to compel them to work, so as to pay him a portion of their earnings. But when Mahaba became chief, trade almost ceased, the people in the interior being afraid to come down, as their property would not be secured from the ravages of Mahaba's people. The Cabuncas, who occupy an extensive region in the interior of Badiboo, reaching to Rio Nunez, on the other hand, were in the habit of coming down by land to Tenderbar, and from there cross over to Badiboo for the express purpose of purchasing horses and phangs, but they have since been afraid to do so.""}, {'id': 591, 'article_title': 'Report of the Commissioner appointed to Inquire into the Condition of the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa.', 'full_section_title': 'Report of the Commissioner appointed to Inquire into the Condition of the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '03-09-1865', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_04_1865#article-18', 'issue_date': '24_04_1865', 'content': 'The Mandingos, who are the chief owners of the soil, are disposed to labour, but they employ their slaves to some extent in cultivation.

The local Government has carefully abstained from any interference in the civil and religious wars which the tribes in the neighbourhood periodically wage against each other, and whenever it has come into collision with them it has been for the vindication of its rights against their aggression; indeed, inquiry shows that in the greater number of instances in which interference has been called for of late years, the Pagans, and not the Moslems, have been the subject of it.

These are cultivated not only by the people of the settlement, but also by the natives from the interior, Serawoollies, Tillichbunkas, and other nomadic tribes who occupy or hire from the owners land on the banks of the creeks and rivers, and in some instances to a distance of forty miles inland, and with the assistance of their domestic slaves, plant the nut about the end of June and reap it at Christmas. It is calculated that one man can work an acre of land which should produce about 300 bushels, worth about 30l.\n\nThe trade is comparatively of recent origin, having only commenced in 1845, in which year the value of the export was but 199l.; in 1858, it had reached 188,000l.; of late years, owing principally to the war amongst the native tribes, it has somewhat fallen off, and in 1864 the value of the crop was only 78,000l. The greater part of these nuts, probably three-fourths, are exported to France, where they are converted into an oil which is sold as olive oil, and is largely used for domestic purposes.\n\nThe recent falling off in the ground-nut crop has led the merchants to direct their attention to cotton, and steps are being taken to induce the natives to adopt its cultivation, fifteen tons and a half having been exported in 1864.\n\nThe policy of this measure appears doubtful: there is no diminution in the demand for ground-nuts, nor any reason to suppose that they will cease to be in request, so long as oil continues so extensively an article of continental consumption; it is difficult to prevail on the natives to change their habits or customs, and, even if successful in the present instance, it must be a long time before the cotton crop can rival in value even the ground-nut crop of the past year. It is also to be feared that the cultivation of cotton, requiring attention during a considerable portion of the year, and being necessarily carried on in the same spot, will be unsuited to the habits of the wandering tribes engaged in growing the ground-nut, a cultivation which only requires their absence from home during four months of the year, and which they can carry on wherever they please on paying a percentage for the use of the land.\n\nMoreover, a cotton plantation is liable to destruction at any time when war may break out in its neighbourhood, whilst ground-nuts are exposed to this very common danger during only one-third of the year.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-03-09', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_04_1865#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.575, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Agriculture on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In a very interesting report on economic agriculture on the Gold Coast, issued from the Colonial Office, some noteworthy information relating to the cultivation of cotton in that part of West Africa is included. Although cotton grows wild in the colony it is almost neglected, except in the Volta district, where Messrs. F. & A. Swanzy have plantations. The quantity exported is extremely small. This wild cotton appears to be of the Brazilian variety, of good colour, but short in staple. For cultivation on a large scale it would be advisable to introduce Egyptian seed or some of the better American varieties. Messrs. Swanzy use Egyptian. Besides the fibre, the seeds of the plant may be made a source of profit, either by exporting them as they are or by the expression and exportation of the oil which they contain. Cotton is largely cultivated in the country behind Kumasi, and the yarn worked up into cloth in the country. The silk-cotton tree yields a fibre which is largely imported into Holland from the Indian Archipelago under the name of kapok, and is used for stuffing furniture. The enormous number of silk-cotton trees in the colony would yield a plentiful supply if the people found it worth collecting and exporting, and the timber is used for making fishing canoes.\n\nRice also might be made an important crop on the Gold Coast. It is grown in the Axim and Quittah districts. In the former district a red variety is grown in the marshy plains. It is large, soft-grained, and sweet, resembling the Sierra Leone rice. In the Quittah district an upland sort is grown, and forms the staple food of the inhabitants.

The cities were surrounded by walls and ditches, a large proportion of the young men followed the business of war, and all able-bodied men were liable to be called upon to protect their homesteads. In spite of these drawbacks, Yorubaland was well and widely cultivated, thickly inhabited, and full of local commercial activity. The price of food prevailing throughout Yoruba would show how industrious were the people and how rich its soil. Maize in the grain sold in the public market place at 6d. per cwt., large yams at 3d. a dozen, sweet potatoes at 1½d. per cwt., beans at 1s. 6d. a cwt., and eggs at from ¾d. to 2d. a dozen, while the most expensive luxuries of beef and mutton were sold for less than 1d. a pound, goats from 2s. 6d. each, sheep from 7s. to 8s., fowls for 3s. a score, and the small cattle of the country from 30s. to £2 10s. each. For 40 cowries—four-fifths of a halfpenny—his wife were in the habit of receiving a good meal. The city of Ibadan was the capital of Yoruba, the London of Negroland. It was surrounded by 163 farming villages, and was estimated to have a population of 250,000, while within the walls of the city 120,000 people were gathered. Other considerable towns were found at distances of a day\'s journey from one another. The trails throughout the country were kept in order by the farmers and villagers. Yoruba held out good prospects of commercial development, for the natives were not only industrious agriculturists for the purpose of supplying their daily wants in food, but they were also a people whose standard of comfort led them to spend much labour in raising and preparing luxuries which could be more cheaply supplied to them from Europe. Backed by the authority of the leading men in the country, he was able by personal inspection to satisfy himself as to the stock of cloth owned by the people, and the quantity annually consumed. He found that, taking an average of rich and poor, an annual consumption of cotton, silk, grass, and mixture cloths existed amounted to not less than 30 yards for each male adult, 45 yards for each female adult, and 6 yards for each child. The Yorubas were a fully-clad race, who for fashion\'s sake were ashamed to appear in public unless gracefully draped with two or three ample cloths. The price of such goods varied from threepence to half-a-crown per yard. They were made of home grown materials, dyed with native dyes, and woven in narrow looms or frames out of yarn spun by hand. From careful calculation it appeared that 31,000,000 yards of cloth were annually consumed in Yoruba, of which 30,000,000 were of home manufacture. From this they would be able to realise the extent to which the people were engaged in the work of making their own garments. In Yoruba there was an immediate market for European goods worth half a million a year, and in return for those goods the people there had the will and the necessary amount of produce to put at least an equal value of trade into our hands. By opening up the rivers of navigable depth there was no doubt that the trade could at least be doubled. These natural waterways were unfortunately as completely choked by vegetation as the overland trade routes were blocked by a rank growth of middlemen. To the industrious and struggling Yorubas, an opening for their energies in the direction of commerce would be invaluable. The Government of this country had for some time been actively engaged in negotiating the opening of the trade routes to the interior by land and water without infringing upon the liberty of the tribes, who were much better left to manage their own affairs, and without using unwise or arbitrary measures. Could other tribes be persuaded, ""for a consideration,"" to relinquish their commercial blockade, which might or might not be quite within their legal rights, there was no doubt that they would be the first to profit by the access of prosperity which would follow. And the Yorubas would profit in no less a degree. Their warlike young men would find in trade an adventurous life well suited to their training, which at present unfitted them for more peaceful employment; a less limited supply of arms would restore the balance of power in the interior, and insure the safety of the coast, while the terrors of the slave trade would give way to a large extent to the more profitable occupations of commercial enterprise.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-07-06', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/06_07_1891#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.587, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sierra Leone and Its People', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A stroll through the town is very interesting.

Excepting in one or two of the principal streets, the houses by the sides of the road stand in gardens full of trees, whose branches stretch over the pathway and afford protection against the rays of the sun. Most people walk, but a few are carried about in a hammock swung from a piece of wood which is borne on the shoulders of four sturdy natives, much in the same way as a palanquin is carried in India. The bearers proceed at a rapid pace, with an easy gliding motion which renders this form of locomotion very comfortable and enjoyable in a climate like that of Sierra Leone, where the thermometer rarely goes much below eighty. Although vehicular traffic is absent, there is no lack of life in the streets of Freetown. The main thoroughfares are crowded with people, and there is plenty of animation and bustle. Fat, jolly-looking negresses, with bright coloured Manchester kerchiefs wound picturesquely round their woolly heads, sit at the street corners presiding over baskets of native produce. Native dandies, attired in what they probably consider the height of fashion, lounge about the principal shops, eyeing the passers-by. There is a cheerful air about all, and every one appears to take life easily. Negroes are proverbially merry-hearted, but I did not know how merry was their disposition until I had been to Sierra Leone, and had an opportunity of seeing them in their own homes. They laugh and joke incessantly, and it is a rare thing to see a sour or unhappy face amongst them. English is the principal language spoken, and most of the shops are for the sale of English goods. One long street is full of shops devoted to the sale of Manchester prints and Birmingham hardware. Amongst the latter I noticed a number of flimsy-looking rifles, which, I imagine, would do more injury to the persons who fired them than to those they were fired at, and a quantity of cheap swords, equally effective in appearance. These articles, I suppose, have a value here, as there is a great demand for them in the interior, and they constitute an important medium of exchange, without which commercial transactions could not be carried through. The names upon the shops are English, and also the notices, which sometimes are of a quaint character; but the retail trade is entirely in the hands of the natives.

Hitherto the carrying powers of a slave and his intrinsic value have been in strict relations, but it is probable the less perishable metallic currency will oust him from the commercial field. In other ways the gradual adoption of specie payments has modified the methods of trade in the Colony, and such firms as have adhered to the old barter system have had to remove to less civilised regions. This is very noticeable in the case of the French firms, who were at one time the leading merchants of Lagos. There are at present few traces of their existence in the Colony, except the large factories which were built by them in the days of their prosperity. The establishment of a branch of the African Banking Corporation Limited, which took place towards the close of the year, will have a very remarkable effect on trade by increasing specie transactions, and even more by encouraging shipments by small traders, to whom money is advanced on the security of insured produce or invoiced European goods.

The Upper Mendi, Konno, and Kuranko districts furnish a wide field for commercial enterprise. Manchester woven goods and cotton have scarcely found their way there and where an article is offered which meets a felt want, it is surprising how quickly the Natives acquire it. The eastern portions of the protectorate, which consist of highlands, with a bracing and salubrious climate, are adapted for the cultivation of coffee, ginger, and other valuable products. Another means for the development of the resources of the country would be the settlement of Natives with capital from Sierra Leone and elsewhere, who would carry on such kinds of agriculture. The aborigines live only for the present; they cannot see the force of cultivating plants such as the coffee for the fruits of which they must wait for four or more years. Though slave raiding has ceased, the chiefs still exercise despotic powers, hence there is no security of tenure, and the people are discouraged from making provision for the future; but a closer control by the Government will do away with this feeling of insecurity. Already I have observed in the Sanda Lokko and other districts the cultivation of young kola trees along the approaches to the villages and towns, but this industry might be very much enlarged; and in the hands of enlightened Natives it might be made remunerative. The principal trade routes from beyond the Protectorate are those which enter it across our northern frontier through the French posts at Herimakunna and Wossu. On the eastern frontier between Herimakunna and Kanre Lahun practically no trade passes along them, owing to the deserted condition of the country. From Kanre Lahun a certain amount of trade is done with the interior at the market in the Bandeh country, but this trade is only intermittent. Along the frontier on the Liberian side from Kanre Lahun to the coast of Manoh Salija there is a constant state of warfare, and the border district is a desert. During my recent tour there appeared to be a revival of trade with the interior across our northern frontier, and the number of caravans that came down was unprecedented; but the future prospects of this trade are uncertain, and its continuance cannot be counted on, nor have the products which have come down had an effect in relieving the depressed condition of the market.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

Around the turn of the century Barue, Tawara, Tonga and other Shona religious spirit mediums (svikiro) (see Fig. 8.1) provided divinely inspired medicines to neutralize the European weapons and turn their bullets into water. 10 Despite the common commitment of some of the Africans to prevent foreign rule and to acquire modern weapons, the immediate tactics they employed varied substantially.

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world.

As J. L. Vellut has emphasized, the nineteenth century was not just 'the history of the ebb and flow of the world economy as experienced by ... Africa', but also 'the slow-moving ... history of diversification in making use of natural resources.'$^{20}$ It is essential to emphasize this internal factor on which the external came to impinge and which shaped the response of African peoples to the external factors. As Cohen has shown in his chapter on the Great Lakes region hitherto studied only as a collection of centralized states responding to external forces - 'the nineteenth century was not simply a world of states, large and small. It was also a world in which individuals and households were in innumerable small, sometimes undramatic ways, altering their orientations to state authority, to service, to production, and to the market.' 21 The agricultural system around the ancient city of Kano in northern Nigeria at the beginning of the nineteenth century provides interesting similarities and contrasts with the world of Bunafu in the 'unadministered zone' of northern Busoga. For one thing, the market played a stronger role in the economy, since Kano was a well-established centre of local, regional and international trade based in part on major and highly successful industrial activity in the manufacture, dyeing and distribution of textiles, and the tanning of leather. Yet it would be misleading to concentrate on the channel effects of the markets and trade routes and to ignore the network of social and cultural relations on which the markets and the trade routes depended. Similarly, in Kano, there was the influence of Islam, and the much greater role of the ruler and the ruling class and merchants of the walled city in the management of the economy. And yet in Kano, as in Bunafu and the village communities of Tunisia, the bulk of agricultural production not only of basic essentials but also of a variety of cottons and dyes was in the hands of commoners in the rural areas among whom the household was the unit of production. As Abdulahi Mahadi has observed in a recent study, the head of a household in the Kano area, the maigida, was 'like a ruler of a town'.

Thus, I am left to conclude that the great reluctance which almost all of them exhibit towards work has been the sole cause of their fleeing the services in question.' 41 Other disgruntled workers sabotaged agricultural equipment, burned warehouses and robbed stores belonging to the concessionary companies and local traders, and destroyed transportation and communication lines."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.587, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Cameroon coast and its hinterland 14 > The Ogowe basin and surrounding regions 23', 'content': 'However, despite the deep inroads made by Western influences, the indigenous societies were able to retain their identity.

In these remote zones, extractions appear to have been more military in character. Armed bands, if not major expeditions, tramped through an area, gathering available stocks of tribute, especially cattle and humans, but also artisans' and marketeers' stocks of ironware and bark-cloth. This was predacity on an immense scale. One military expedition organized in Buganda moved into Busoga, camping in one area for several months. Smaller collection parties were sent hither and yon. In this case, the sources suggest that the tribute-collecting army from Buganda was stationed in the country long enough to force up the production and preparation of foodstuffs and preparation beyond the typical military booty. The tribute taken was consumed by the occupying expeditionary force and some was eventually returned to the courts of Buganda. What almost certainly happened in this case was that the Ganda army remained in Busoga too briefly to stimulate or force a permanent expansion in the production of foodstuffs and other commodities in the region they occupied.\nBut they were there long enough to dismantle a substantial part of the productive organization of central Busoga - which would require many years to recover.

In March 1856 a girl by the name of Nongqause, who was apparently under the religious tutelage of Mhlakaza, one of the advisers of Chief Sarili, prophesied that if the people killed all their cattle, destroyed their grain stores, and did not plant any crops that year, a whirlwind would come and blow the English oppressors into the sea. Besides, their heroes would rise from the dead and bring vast herds of cattle, huge quantities of grain, and even white men's manufactured goods. The message was obeyed by the Xhosa and the Thembu, and when the appointed day came nothing happened. Large numbers of people died of starvation on both sides of the Kei in 1857. Many of the Xhosa in the Ciskei streamed to the Cape Colony to seek employment among the whites as the only means of survival. The whole episode makes little sense and people have tried to look for hidden explanations without success. E. A.

Little or no evidence exists to support either of these views. Perhaps Monica Wilson is right in interpreting the cattle-killing among the Xhosa just like the many, millenarian movements that have taken place in Europe, America and elsewhere in Africa. It was a movement, Wilson tells us, in which people sought to rid themselves of foreign domination and to recover their lands from the white settlers. 11 In the meantime Grey had taken advantage of the cattle-killing episode and its consequent weakening of the Xhosa and the Thembu. He confiscated large pieces of land from many of Sandile's chiefs whom he suspected of plotting an uprising against the British. The dispossessed chiefs and the people of Sarili were then all driven right across the Mbashe river so that an empty zone patrolled by the British police remained between the Kei and Mbashe rivers.

The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered. Yellow fever epidemics have occurred from Senegal to Sudan at unpredictable intervals. By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

The transition in extraction from occasional collection towards regularized collections may have marked the process of incorporation of frontier areas and entirely new areas of production into the Lakes region state. An example of a pattern of collection falling along the middle of such a continuum is the extraction of production from central Busoga by agents of Buganda.6 These were not regularly administered extractions but they were sufficiently controlled and routine to require no military force and to enable them to produce foodstuffs in a prepared form in enormous amounts. There is a suggestion of prior notification and prior preparation. In these extractions from central Busoga, the most common commodity extracted was dried bananas (Lusoga: muterØ) transported both as meal and as sundried cakes. The routine and frequent tribute collection from a specific area would have forced production in the tributary zone far beyond the expected consumption requirements of the producers themselves. In a sense, this tributary zone production encompassed 'defensive surpluses'. Such surpluses would have given the impression to early European trav› ellers in the region of unending abundance and self-sufficiency of the little producer,$^{7}$ alongside the more familiar image of sumptuous conditions in the courts. What these travellers would have missed was the structure of 'defensive surplus' in which the effective costs of production of whatever 'reciprocal' goods and services the tribute-taking state offered its tributary zones were transferred to the tribute-producers.

The invasion of wetter, tropical Africa by cultivated crops was less successful, although the locally domesticated yam was rain-tolerant and grew well enough on the forest margins as did the West African variety of rice. Early in the Christian era plants more suited to equatorial Africa, the banana (especially its large non-sweet variety, the plantain) and the Asian yam reached East Africa and slowly spread westward.$^{36}$ But the conquest of the forest was a long slow process and agriculture and population grew slowly within its confines, so slowly indeed that up to the fifteenth century the forested northerly part of the Congo basin seems to have been sparsely occupied by hunters and food-gatherers and considerable areas are still occupied by these people. 37 In terms of demographic history, the important point is that the forest was the home of very few people five hundred years ago. The major exceptions were the fringes, the coast and the important inter-regional routes. For instance in Nigeria an example of the first is the lagoon area either side of Lagos, of the second is Old Oyo, and of the third is both Ife and Benin on the route which crosses the Niger at the lowest point where it is easily accessible and crossable before reaching the delta. Since then the movement into the forest has continued at an accelerating rate and is by no means complete. To take another Nigerian example, and a contemporary one, the opening up of the wet forest south of Ondo (and to the south-east of the massively crowded central Yorubaland) to intensive cultivation has largely been a product of the building of the road from Ijebu Ode to Benin in the early 1960s.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.603, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 507, 'article_title': 'Baines on West Africa', 'full_section_title': 'Baines on West Africa', 'last_edit_date': '12-23-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1864#article-22', 'issue_date': '23_12_1864', 'content': '...pedition, and the labours and perils attendant on ivory trading ""beyond the limits of civilization"" are worthy of notice by those to whose luxury they minister.

They have now taken possession of nearly all the upper waters of the Gaboon and the surrounding country, having driven the Babékés and Shekanies before them, and in a few years will probably reach the seaboard. According to a statement recently made by Vice-Admiral Fleuriot Langle, at a meeting of the French Geographical Society, there are no less than 80,000 of them in the vicinity of the Gaboon, and the number is rapidly increasing. But I do not agree with the Admiral\'s opinion that their language nearly resembles the Zulu of South Africa; for having, with a committee of linguists in the United States, carefully compared the Zulu with the dialects of this part of Africa a few years since, we discovered no such connection. Their language has been partially acquired and reduced to writing by members of our mission, and it does not seem to differ very materially from those of the coast tribes; though it is, in character with the people who speak it, more harsh and abrupt, caring less for fluency and euphony. When first discovered, the Fanhs were the most robust and athletic race of Africans we had ever seen; but in their transition from the more elevated interior to the low malarious regions of the coast, we notice a gradual physical deterioration, which may be owing, not entirely to change of climate and location, but to less active, daring habits, and to the destroying influence of foreign liquors, of which they were formerly in blissful ignorance. When we first made their acquaintance, domestic slavery was unknown among them, and it is not probable that the foreign slave-trade had ever preyed upon them to any great extent. They are great elephant hunters, and have much skill in entrapping and killing these lords of the African forest; and most of the ivory which is shipped from this part of the coast passes through their hands. In addition to guns, with which they are now generally supplied, they make use of bows and poisoned arrows in hunting and war. Their arrows are dipped in a preparation made from a bean, which grows upon a forest tree called Oni, the effect of which is almost certain death. But they have also knowledge of the bark of a certain tree which is an antidote to this poison. Their spears, knives, and broad double-edged swords or daggers are curious specimens of native workmanship.

We think we can discern two indentations in the forehead, which appear to be eyes, but the highest magnifying power we have is the microscope out of a sextant. Its neck is protected by a shield, also dark brown, either in two parts, or made to appear so by a lighter stripe down the middle; its legs are brown, and seem at first only like small hooks, but examination shows that they are beautifully jointed; and along each side, just at the edge of the belly, is a double row of a dozen dark spots, the uppermost of which seems to be merely colours, while the lower is a small tubercle, with a dark-edged circular orifice. We were much puzzled by a covering of green matter, similar in colour to the leaf it feeds on. At first we thought it was the first skin peeling off, and lay in loose rolls parallel to the transverse muscular rings of the body; it seemed gradually driven forward toward the head, where it formed a shield, or hood, portions breaking off as it dried, and being replaced by fresh. At length we were enabled to decide that it must be the excrement of the creature, issuing not only in the usual manner, but from the pores that are scattered over nearly the whole of the body. When the grub attains a length of three quarters of an inch, this matter is more sparingly distributed, and is of a brownish colour.

H. Johnston read a paper ""On the Ethnology of the Congo and South-western Africa."" Mr. Johnston stated that the coast of Africa, between the Senegal and Mossamedes, afforded the best ground for studying the negro and collateral races. Round about Mossamedes there were found Bushmen and Hottentots, and the latter had amalgamated to some extent with native tribes. They were distinguished by the clicks in their tongue, the Bushmen perhaps the most archaic, having eight, the Hottentots four, and the others two. When the Hottentots invaded the Mossamedes district great consternation was caused among the native tribes; but they had settled down quietly, and they suffered terribly from disease in the rainy seasons. Outside their own territory it was not probable that they would give much trouble. In most of the tribes the women had to do all the hard work, and were in consequence stronger and more muscular than the men. In one instance the women had it all their own way, and they alone had the privilege of anointing their bodies, but as the unguents they used were rancid butter and disagreeably-smelling herbs, their presence to strangers was made insupportable. One remarkable fact was that there was no great despotic chief ruling vast numbers of these people, each petty chief owning sway only over a comparatively small population. The Bantu tribes, who inhabited the Congo district, might be divided roughly into two classes, one of a low type, living next the coast, and one very much higher, inhabiting the parts in the upper reaches round Stanley Pool. The former were small and ill-made, and the latter well-built and courteous in their demeanour. The villages between Vivi and Stanley Pool had a very prosperous appearance. Here also the women did all the trading, haggling over their wares with extreme vigour, while the men were the ornamental part of the race. When any disputes arose between buyer and seller, they were referred to the market arbitrator, who invariably fined both parties so heavily that his interference was very seldom invoked. Among the Inkimbi there were some curious superstitions and ceremonies. If any person died, some one who was supposed to have caused it was compelled to drink a decoction of poisonous herbs with the view of making him vomit the evil spirit within him which had caused the mischief. They had also a kind of freemasonry among the males with certain passwords and signs. The initiation into this select body consisted of three stages. During the novitiate, which lasted six months, was taught the sacred language, which no woman was ever allowed to learn, and which no stranger had yet been able to investigate. It was probably some original archaic form of the Bantu tongue preserved among the select class, just as in other countries, Sanskrit, old Slavonic and Latin were used. Among several tribes phallic worship prevailed very largely. When a great chief died, four slaves were generally put to death, so that their spirits might go to wait upon their master, and in the burying place of any one of any consequence there were always placed a quantity of cloth, plates, knives, &c., so that the individuals might be prepared to commence life anew. The people generally were very superstitious, and had but a vague and shadowy idea of another life.

If they have 200 or 300 muskets and ammunition in proportion, they think success is certain. No traders having ever before entered Manyuema, the value of ivory was quite unknown. Indeed, the tusks were left in the forests with the other bones where the animals had been slain—many were rotten, others were gnawed by a rodent animal to sharpen his teeth, as London rats do on leaden pipes. If civilly treated, the people went into the forest to spots where they knew elephants had been killed either by traps or spears, and brought the tusks for a few copper bracelets. I have seen parties return with so much ivory, they carried it by three relays of hundreds of slaves. But even this did not satisfy human greed. The Manyuema were found to be terrified by the report of guns; some, I know, believed them to be supernatural, for when the effect of a musket-ball was shown on a goat, they looked up to the clouds, and offered to bring ivory to buy the charm by which lightning was drawn down. When a village was assaulted, the men fled in terror, and women and children were captured. Many of the Manyuema women, especially far down the Lualaba, are very pretty, light-colored, and lovely. It was common to hear the Zanzibar slaves—whose faces resemble the features of London door-knockers, which some atrocious iron-founder thought were like those of lions—say to each other, \'Oh, if we had Manyuema wives, what pretty children we should get!\' Manyuema men and women were all vastly superior to the slaves, who evidently felt the inferiority they had acquired by wallowing in the mire of bondage. Many of the men were tall, strapping fellows, with but little of what we think distinctive of the negro about them. If one relied on the teachings of phrenology, the Manyuema men would take a high place in the human family. They felt their superiority, and often said truly, \'Were it not for fire-arms, not one of the strangers would ever leave our country.\' If a comparison were instituted, the Manyuema, taken at random, placed opposite, say, the members of the Anthropological Society of London, clad, like them, in kilts of grass cloth, I should like to take my place alongside the Manyuema, on the principle of preferring the company of my betters; the philosophers would look wofully scraggy. But though the \'inferior race,\' as we compassionately call them, have finely-formed heads and often handsome features, they are undoubtedly cannibals. It was more difficult to ascertain this than may be imagined. Some think that they can detect the gnawings of the canine teeth of our cannibal ancestry on fossil bones, though the canine teeth of dogs are pretty much like the human. For many a month all the evidence I could collect amounted only to what would lead a Scotch jury to give a verdict of \'Not proven.\' This arose partly from the fellows being fond of a joke, and they like to horrify anyone who seemed credulous. They led one of my people, who believed all they said, to see the skull of a recent human victim, and he invited me in triumph. It found it to be the skull of a gorilla—here called sobo—and for the first time became aware of the existence of the animal there.

There are also several tribes beyond the falls who have little or no communication with the seacoast. Above the falls, on the falls, and a little below the falls, is a tribe called the Webboes, who occupy the right bank of the river for about fourteen miles, and extend a great distance into the bush. It is said that this tribe has from thirty-six to forty towns both in the bush and on the river. On the left bank, opposite the Webboes, is a tribe called the Carboes. Below the Carboe, on the same bank, is a tribe called the Barrawurboes. A little distance below Webbo, on the right bank, is a tribe called the Gerraboes. The Carboes, Barrawurboes, and the Gerraboes are allies, and are in hostilities with the Webboes for a piece of land which they alleged was theirs, and which the Webboes are occupying. This war has existed for many years. Either tribe has always been afraid to pass the towns of the other tribes, except they steal by at night. Some weeks ago about seven Webbo boys came down to the beach. On their return, three were in one canoe and four in another. The canoe containing the three boys passed unseen at night by the Gerraboes and Barrawurboes, though these tribes were on the river watching, as they heard that some Webbo boys were expected up. The other canoe, which had the four boys, as they were about to pass, were hailed by the Barrawurbo people. This was on the night of the 12th inst. The poor Webbo boys got so bewildered that they jumped out of the canoe and ran into the bush. In their attempt to get away one of the boys was caught, and cut so unmercifully across the forehead that his brains protruded. The other three succeeded in hiding themselves in the bush during that night. Early the next morning the Barrawurbo people went in search of them, and unfortunately found two of them. The other boy, who was not found, had been a schoolboy educated at the mission station at Webbo, called Bohlen Station. This school was established by the Right Rev. Bishop Payne, and is connected with the American Protestant Episcopal Church. This boy had left the school for some time; and he himself relates that the Barrawurbo people walked over the place were he had hid himself. When he saw them he said that he prayed to God in his heart as he had been taught by the missionaries, that if God would hide him from his enemies this time he would return to school and be a good boy. God heard this poor boy's prayer and hid him from the eyes of his enemies. After they had gone he made his escape to Beerbo, a tribe below Gerrabo, to the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Thornton. Of the three boys who were captured, the one who was cut across the forehead, died during the night, and was cooked and eaten on the morning of the 13th. The other two were cruelly tied both hands and feet. The Barrawurboes invited the Carboes and Gerraboes to come over and help to kill the two remaining boys. They accordingly hastened over with shouting, dancing, beating of drums, and blowing war horns. No entreaties nor cries of the Webbo boys could move the hearts of these heathen tribes. Every man went up to the poor Webbo boys and gave them a chop with his cutlass and laughed at their cries and entreaties; and then they cut off their heads and divided the meat, each tribe taking their portion, cooked it and eat it. They also cooked rice, and put it in the skulls, mixed it up with the brains and eat it out of the skulls, which they say will make them brave in time of war.

The walls of their dwellings are rarely, if ever, whitewashed, and are often crowded, ill-ventilated, and dirty. Most of the rooms are miserably small, dark, damp, and badly ventilated, especially those devoted to sleep. In their sleeping places the poorer classes, and many persons in better circumstances, keep all the dirty clothing not in wear either about their beds or hanging from the wall, scraps of food and putrid fish being strewed about or collected in corners. The lower rooms open into inner courts, where, in fine weather, the members of the several families meet, and where they often cook and eat their food. The houses of what may be termed the middling class are well furnished with European articles of cabinet furniture, with crockery, glass, and mirrors, while the walls are decorated with cheap prints. The wealthy native gentlemen (living in the seaboard towns) live in well-built houses, commodiously, and often elegantly, furnished; but few of them have fireplaces in the public rooms or bedrooms—a want which impairs health in a country exposed to heavy night-dews, and in some wet seasons to heavy falls of rain. The general custom on the Gold Coast is to burn charcoal in clay pots in the public rooms and bedrooms when the weather is damp or cold.

After a prolonged struggle he was fain to make good his retreat, stung by mosquitoes, bitten by ants, with torn clothes, and arms and legs bleeding from the thorns and prickles with which the climbing palm (Calamus), the climbing hibiscus, the euphorbia, and a multitude of other jungle plants, repulsed every attack made on their impenetrable labyrinth. ""But the attempt,"" observes the Professor, ""had not been made altogether in vain, for it enabled me to gain a very fair idea of the jungle as a whole, more especially of the magnificence of its trees and creepers, besides introducing me to many separate varieties of animal and vegetable life, which were of the highest interest. Here I saw the magnificent Gloriosa superba, the poisonous climbing lily of Ceylon, with its red and amber flowers; the prickly Hibiscus radiatus, with large, cup-shaped, brimstone-coloured flowers, deepening to violet in the hollow; while around them fluttered gigantic black butterflies with blood-red spots on their tail-shaped wings, and chafers and dragon-flies flew past with a metallic gleam. But my delight reached its height when on this my first attempt to penetrate a jungle in Ceylon I came across the two most characteristic of its inhabitants from among the higher class of animals—parrots and apes. A flock of green parrots flew screeching from a lofty tree, as they became aware of the gun in my hand, and at the same moment a herd of great black apes sprang with a growling cry into the thicket. I did not succeed in getting a shot at either one or the other; they appeared to be too familiar with the look of a gun. I was consoled, however, by securing with my first shot a colossal lizard, or iguana, 6ft. long, of a kind held in much awe by the superstitious natives (Hydrosaurus salvator). The huge, crocodile-like beast was sunning himself on the edge of a water-tank, and the shot hit him so precisely on the head as to kill him at once. Had it struck any less vital part he would probably have dived into the water and disappeared.

The first occurred on the Bass River, on the 1st of November, at about one P.M., when a son of Mr. Patrick Guinlivan, aged eleven years, was bitten just above the ankle by a snake. The punctures of the two poison fangs were distinctly visible, with a little blood flowing from them. A ligature was applied, and about half a tumbler of strong spirits given in two doses. The symptoms increasing in severity, a piece of skin was removed from over one of the most prominent veins at the bend of the elbow, the point of the syringe carefully introduced into the vein, and about ten minims of prepared ammonia injected. The relief was almost instantaneous. Some time after, the foot being very painful below the ligature, this was removed, and additional poison entering the circulation, the worst symptoms of snake-poisoning returned—viz., total loss of power over the legs, cold clammy skin, and almost imperceptible breathing, while an occasional fluttering was all that could be felt of the pulse. Ten more minims were injected into the same vein. In two minutes the pulse could be again detected, a decided improvement set in, and by seven o\'clock in the evening the boy was well, and laughing as heartily as any one could wish. The other case occurred in Tasmania, and was reported in the _Launceston Examiner_ of the 10th of November. A shepherd at Waterhouse was severely bitten just below the knee by a large snake. All the symptoms of snake-poisoning set in, but the remedy was applied, and the man speedily recovered. He described the sensation caused by the injection of the ammonia as that of an electric shock passing through his frame.', 'last_edit_date': '1871-03-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1871#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.625, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of West Africa—Gold Mining—The Labour Question', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Now, first, as regards the climate and mode of living. With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.615, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}]",True

Finally, there were charms, amulets and talismans which were used for protective as well as offensive purposes.\nThe general conception of man was that he was a compound of immaterial and material substance. The immaterial part of man (the soul) survived him after death, while the material part (the body) disintegrated after death. Death therefore did not end life; it was an extension of life. The dead remained members of society and there was believed to be a community of the dead alongside the community of the living, and there was a symbiotic relationship between the two communities. Human society was an unbroken family made up of the dead, the living and the yet unborn.\nWith regard to man's relation to society, being human meant belonging to a community and that involved participating in the beliefs, ceremonies, rituals and festivals ofthat community$^{2}$ and membership of the community was emphasized more than a member's individuality. For society was based more on obligation than on individual rights and an individual assumed his rights in the exercise of his obligations, which made society a chain of interrelationships. Furthermore, human life was viewed and understood as a cycle of birth, puberty, marriage and procreation, death and the afterlife. An individual did not stay in one stage of existence for ever; he necessarily moved on to the next, and in order to make the transition smooth, special rites were performed to ensure that no breaks occurred, and movement and regeneration continued perpetually. 3\nAfrican traditional religion was not only pervasive, it also bound men to the unseen powers and helped them to form correct relations with the non-human powers; it also bound men to their fellow human beings.\nReligion acted as the cement which held societies together, providing them with support and stability.

Essentially a spirit, God had no images or physical representations and was acknowledged as the Creator and Sustainer of the world. Power, justice, beneficence and eternity were attributed to Him, and as the Source of all Power, God had power over life and death. He rewarded men but also punished them when they went wrong and was in many ways likened to the Overlord of Society and was the Final Authority in all matters. On the whole, God was unlike human beings and was completely above His creation, but at the same time, He was involved in the affairs of men, sustaining creation and upholding the moral order. Human beings depended upon Him as a Power superior to them. God was therefore transcendent as well as immanent.\nThere was a hierarchy of spirits. Below God were the ancestral spirits, which were always treated with reverence and with awe, and then there were also the deities or gods who were believed to have the power of rewarding human beings or punishing them with misfortune, disease or even death.

It is plain that neither the Mwari cult nor the system of spirit mediums was capable of committing itself wholly to resistance or wholly to anything; both were based on constant and intense competition between and within shrines; the astonishing survival of the cults depended upon the fact that priests or mediums who had backed a mistaken or defeated cause could rapidly be replaced by rivals waiting in the wings, and upon the fact that some important cult centres would always adopt positions different from others. Some Mwari shrines backed the rising and others did not, and at the shrines which did support it the families in charge were replaced after its suppression. I was wrong to suppose that the total religious leadership of the Shona would commit itself wholly to the risings; the risings were crucially important but not so important that they could - or should - disrupt the long-term patterns of persistence and effectiveness of the cults. 30 All this is relevant to the argument over the centrality of protest to prophetic movements. A prophet emerges in response to a popular sense that there is need for radical and innovative action, but such a popular sense need not arise only because of external threat.

First, the manner in which slaves were procured tended to destroy social and political structures. Social outcasts, offenders against the law, were sold into slavery. A few persons were sold in times of famine or for debt. But the majority of slaves were apparently taken by kidnapping, raiding and wars. The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda. Accordingly, the extensive influence exercised by the Aro over Igboland through its oracle did not become an integrative force.$^{9}$ The element of violence inherent in Aro addiction to the slave trade thus distinguished their influence from the earlier ritual influ› ence of the Nri people over wide areas of Igboland.\nIn the economic sphere also, the disruption to normal agricultural activities must have been considerable. In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars. The metal bars were turned into pewters, ritual bells, state swords, leg-rings, and other ornaments. But these supplies replaced local industries, and the Awka smiths turned their backs on local sources of metal.

In local trade it was used to purchase salt, kola nuts, boubous (loose ankle-length robes), slaves, livestock and grain. According to L. G. Binger, bar salt from the desert was much more highly regarded than other kinds. It came from Taoudeni by way of Timbuktu, Mopti, Jenne, Bla and San, subsequently being distributed throughout the Sahel and the savanna country. The same was true of the salt that reached Segu by way of Adrar and Tichit. Sea salt from the coast and salt collected from the river saltpan at Daboya was carried as far as Kong. In the Volta region of the Sahel, the chiefs of Jiibo developed a cunning technique for accumu› lating slaves. If a slave killed someone and then gave himself up to the chief, he would be acquitted and would become the property of the latter; in cases of theft, if the thief was rich the chief would strip him of his wealth.$^{54}$ By the end of the century, the population of Dori included 50000 free men and 50000 captives.

An editor informed me that a friend of his who visited the Centennial advised him that he saw the gold trinkets from the Gold Coast, but he was told that those trinkets were made by the white settlers on the Gold Coast. I beg to deny this assertion _in toto_. In the first place, there are no white settlers on the West Coast of Africa, beginning from ""St. Mary\'s Bathurst, Gambia,"" to ""St. Paul de Loanda."" The few Europeans and Americans on that Coast are either Government officials, missionaries, or merchants. The large assortment of gold trinkets that are in the main building at the Centennial are as follows: Gold ear-rings, gold drops, gold bracelets, of various designs; gold hair-combs, gold crosses, gold brooches, in shapes of butterflies and other designs; gold rings, with the twelve signs of the Zodiac and numerous other designs; gold beads, gold studs, gold links, gold chains, gold necklaces, gold guards, gold dust, and other gold trinkets too numerous to mention; and these gold trinkets were made by the native Africans, some of whom cannot speak a word of the English language. In style of workmanship these trinkets are unequalled by anything made by civilized craftsmen the world over. Certainly there is nothing in this line in the Centennial that may be placed beside them; and when it is considered that they were wrought with rude tools, that the artizans were native men, unskilled in civilized art; that they and their fathers from time immemorial have ever lived on the Gold Coast, that they are the manufacturers of the largest assortment of trinkets in the Centennial,—then it seems to me that these men,—the ""Ashantees,"" the ""Accras,"" the ""Fantees,"" the ""Denkras,"" the ""Wassaws,"" the ""Assins,"" &c.,—should not be deprived of the meed of praise which belongs to them, but should receive the just reward for their great genius and their native art. I therefore, as an African, of which I am proud, having been born, bred and educated on that Coast, feel called upon to make this explanation. On several occasions while visiting the Centennial, I spent some time in explaining to the ladies and gentlemen who crowded around me that these trinkets were made by the native Africans, and I took great pains to impress upon their minds the capability and ingenuity of the native Africans.

The walls of their dwellings are rarely, if ever, whitewashed, and are often crowded, ill-ventilated, and dirty. Most of the rooms are miserably small, dark, damp, and badly ventilated, especially those devoted to sleep. In their sleeping places the poorer classes, and many persons in better circumstances, keep all the dirty clothing not in wear either about their beds or hanging from the wall, scraps of food and putrid fish being strewed about or collected in corners. The lower rooms open into inner courts, where, in fine weather, the members of the several families meet, and where they often cook and eat their food. The houses of what may be termed the middling class are well furnished with European articles of cabinet furniture, with crockery, glass, and mirrors, while the walls are decorated with cheap prints. The wealthy native gentlemen (living in the seaboard towns) live in well-built houses, commodiously, and often elegantly, furnished; but few of them have fireplaces in the public rooms or bedrooms—a want which impairs health in a country exposed to heavy night-dews, and in some wet seasons to heavy falls of rain. The general custom on the Gold Coast is to burn charcoal in clay pots in the public rooms and bedrooms when the weather is damp or cold. From inquiries I have made, I find that twenty may be safely reckoned the average number of tenants living under one roof in the two-storied houses in Cape Coast, and it often happens that sober, decent people dwell in one apartment, and a drunken man in the next, for I regret to say that drunkenness is a wide-spread vice among the natives—a circumstance chiefly dependent upon the cheapness of the spirits imported from the United States, Holland, and the Brazils.""\n\nAnd again:—\n\n""The mass of the inhabitants bury their dead in the basement floor of their houses—a practice not confined to the pagan part of the population, but also practised by many respectable and wealthy families.

When the deceased is wealthy, valuable articles, as gold ornaments, gold dust, aggrey beads, are placed in the coffin, and the body is sprinkled with gold dust. These tombs in this way become family banks, and in the time of trouble the gold so deposited is applied to meet pressing claims or other family purposes.

The statement of these men is somewhat alarming, and presents a new feature in the history of plunder and brutal treatment to persons which from time to time are reported to us as taking place on that river. The circumstances of the case are as follows: Towards the latter part of March last, Sallah, Corveh, and Siamah, traders, left Hortey, a small town in the vicinity of Quittah, under passport from the Government officer there, to proceed with three canoes, loaded with salt and cowries, to the Volta, bound for Salagha; on their way they landed at Engabee, a small town on the margin of the Volta, belonging to Dagado, King of Panto, in the Crepee country; and whilst in this place, a number of Houssa men, armed with guns, spears, bows, and arrows, having their drums beating, and headed by one Otuman Katto, came there; Otuman Katto then made them to understand, through the head men of Engabee, that he was authorized by his Excellency the Governor, by King Dagado, and by King Quajoe Dey, to prevent Ahwoonahs and Acquamoos going to Salagha; and that King Dagado and King Quajoe Dey having obtained the sanction of the white men to put to death all Ahwoonahs and Acquamoos who may come to their country, Sallah and his companions are to consider their heads as forfeited. At his command, these men were at once seized by the Houssas, and their hands held fast behind them to be bound, when the head men and people of Engabee interceded; a price was then set on them, and the sum of 330 heads of cowries, equal to 16l. 10s. sterling money, was paid to Otuman Katto, who then ordered them to return to their country. Such is the statement of these men. The Acquamoos men who were amongst them have also been plundered; but, for want of space, we are obliged to pass over that subject for the present. The question naturally presents itself, how long will such a state of things be allowed to continue in the Volta, and whether the Executive authorities on the Coast would not help to remove this evil in the way of trade?\n\nKing Dagado's territories are, in fact, not within the limits of the Protectorate, and the authorities on the Coast may be excused for taking no cognizance of offences which are committed in places beyond their jurisdiction; but the boldness and frequency with which these offences occur in the Volta, and the evil effects this may have on the trade there, demand the sympathy and interference of the authorities, for these offences are committed always by persons from the Coast, without the participation of the native chiefs."", 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1882#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.596, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ancient Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'hair of Buddha belong to the black race, and Nahsi is the negro name.

As Karl Vogt says, ""Our civilisation came not from Asia, but from Africa, and Heer has proved that the cultivated plants in the Swiss lake-villages are of African, and, to a great extent, of Egyptian origin."" According to Logan, the pre-Aryan civilisation of Southern India had a partially Egyptian character. The oldest races, he asserts, were of a variable African type which spoke languages allied to the African. Egypt, and not India, is the common cradle of all we have in common, east, west, north, and south, all round the world. The languages, beliefs, rites, laws and customs went out to India, but did not return thence by means of the apocryphal Aryan migrations. The Indian affinity with our European folk-lore and fairyology is neither first nor final, \'tis but the affinity of a collateral relationship.

At first their reports were vague, and, like most native stories, highly coloured by imagination, and exaggerated in passing through the lips of numerous reporters. They were represented as a people of gigantic stature and lion-like courage, nearly white, with long, straight hair. Their number was compared to the leaves of the forest and sands of the seashore. Wonderful accounts were given of their exploits in war, armed with weapons of their own manufacture, from iron dug from their own native hills; and, in the imagination of the timid coast people, they were regarded almost literally as being able one to chase a thousand, and two to put ten thousand to flight. As a matter of course, we felt no little curiosity to become acquainted with this remarkable people, and it was not long before our desire was gratified by seeing specimens of the tribe, who, as pioneers, were beginning cautiously to descend from their unexplored wilds toward the coast. The first two seen by the writer were indeed fine specimens of savage men; not white, but of a lighter tinge, more of a copper complexion than that of the people inhabiting the marshy lowlands bordering upon the rivers and coasts. Their hair was not straight, but in long plaited tresses hung over their shoulders, and their nearly nude bodies were smooth, and as sleek and shining as oil mingled with powdered redwood could make them. Their ivory-white teeth, filed sharp like saw-teeth, together with their wild bright eyes and whole appearance, indicated them unmistakably as representatives of a race of independent savages who had hitherto been uninfluenced by the semi-civilisation of the coast. Occasionally we met with others, and learned that the first advance of a great emigration from the interior had been made, and that several outpost settlements had been established upon the western slopes, and at the foot of the mountains and on the sources of the rivers.

If the rites and ceremonies of the religion of the tribes bordering on the banks of the River Niger be closely examined and compared with the religion of the Hebrews at the earliest period—viz., Egbo Ebo (Heber, Eber) tribe; if the Egbo (Heber Eber) language, with all its corruption, be compared with that of the Hebrews; and if the peculiar disposition of the Hebrew tribes, as detailed in Scripture, and that of the Egboes be properly investigated—there will be found by the philosophic mind sufficient a priori reasons for a serious inquiry whether the Egbo tribe, which is but a branch of the Gala tribe in the interior, is the offspring of the lost tribes of Israel, driven down from central Africa, and forced to cross the Eastern or Quorra branch of the Niger by Mohammedan fanaticism."", 'last_edit_date': '1865-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.597, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'WEST COAST OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Sambo being the original color of man, the African becomes darker by a deposit of coloured matter in the cells or corpuscles in the true skin, or derma, which is produced by exposure to the heat of the sun, extreme degradation in their social habits, and the low state of their diet and regimen, as well as by the life consequent upon the constant internal warfare which is carried on amongst them.

And the traders, with one exception, are as remorseless as the grave. If they can gain a few pounds of ivory or india-rubber, they care not if the liquor they sell destroys every living being in Africa. There is perfect recklessness in those who come here; no thought for anything except for the greatest gain in the two or three years they are to remain. And how many of them, when counting the few days to their departure, and seeing home and all its joys so near, were cut down in a day! Death laid his hand on them, and visions of home became dark as Erebus. And there was no miracle and no special providence in this. It was only rendering to every man according to his deeds. And if rum has killed a fourth or a third of this people since we came here, it has killed quite as large a proportion of the traders who have sold the poison. Where the foot of the white man has never trod, the fiery stream of alcohol rolls and burns, causing waste and anguish and horrors greater than the middle passage ever witnessed. Some people wonder why the Coast tribes of Africa waste away and disappear. It is no wonder to one who has lived here with his eyes open, unless he himself has come within the maelstrom. The Coast is beleaguered with the hosts of Satan; and they are bold, persistent, untiring, unscrupulous, and unmerciful. If you wish to know some of the concomitants of the rum trade and rum-drinking, read Proverbs xxiii. 33. These are our real obstacles. Heathenism is bad, but unmixed it is not impregnable.

There are four European factories here—two English, a German, and a Portuguese. The principal, indeed, almost the only export is rubber, of which about two hundred and fifty thousand pounds are annually shipped from here. The palm oil tree flourishes in the country round about here, but the natives do not understand how to procure the oil from it, just as on other parts of the coast where rubber trees are in abundance, the export consists almost entirely of palm oil, as the natives do not understand how to procure the rubber. The people round about here seem a quiet and inoffensive race, and friendly to Europeans, whom, unlike the tribes on other parts of the coast, they do not attempt to prevent proceeding inland for the purposes of trade. The great difficulty in the country about here is the want of communication; there are no rivers, no roads, and consequently native labour has to be employed for the conveyance of produce, which, as the native is dilatory in his movements, is an expensive means of locomotion. The consequence is that rubber, which can be bought for the equivalent of about 2d. a pound at the place of production, by the time it has reached here for shipment, costs about 8d., or about 300 per cent. for cost of conveyance. Still, as the value of it on arrival in England is at present about one shilling and sixpence, there is still a fair margin for profit. The country abounds with rubber-producing trees, and arboriculture of the gum-producing species of all kinds.

Many decades of British efforts to discover the course and sources of the Niger river were crowned with success when Richard and John Lander were brought from Aboh to Nembe (Brass) by its ruler, King Boy Amain, in 1830. Once the estuaries of the many rivers of the Niger delta were shown to be the entrance to the great Niger river, British interest was greatly increased in the area as a highway into the rich interior of Nigeria and West Africa. British traders, such as Macgregor Laird, as well as humanitarians and missionaries tried to move up the delta into the hinterland between the 1830s and 1850s.\nIn the eastern delta itself, the Church Missionary Society under the leadership of the Nigerian ex-slave, Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther, estab› lished missions at Bonny in 1864, at Twon-Brass in the Nembe kingdom in 1868, at Elem Kalahari (New Calabar in the documents) in 1874, and at Okrika in 1880. Both at Bonny and Nembe, the rulers invited the missionaries for a number of reasons. Some wished to have the missionaries establish schools in which their children could learn to read, write and speak English in order to carry on their commercial relations with British firms. It was also believed that permission for the missionaries would lead to better relations with the British government, represented by the consuls and naval officers, and serve to strengthen them against neighbouring states in internal power struggles. These same reasons sometimes led to the missionaries being rejected in other parts of the eastern delta. Thus, once the Church Missionary Society was established at Bonny, Jaja of Opobo, who had broken away from Bonny in 1869 to form his state of Opobo, would have nothing to do with that mission. The establishment of Christian missions was, however, resisted by powerful interests within each of the delta states, and Christianity constituted a factor of social instability in the nineteenth century.

Accordingly, the European presence on the coast became another unifying factor in the history of the region, presenting common problems and stimuli to change. Thus, each of the communities in the region underwent changes or adaptations in their social, political or cultural structures in the face of the external influences and challenge of European intrusion.

There has been a tendency, similar to what happens in oral tradition, to telescope all significant change in the whole precolonial history of Africa into the favoured period of the nineteenth century. Fortunately, other volumes of the Unesco General History have already dealt with the dynamics of change in Africa in the earlier periods. The 'myth' of static Africa has thus already been exploded.

This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.\nIn the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium. Major Christian missionary bodies such as the Church Missionary Society (CMS) of the Church of England and the Lyons-based SociØtØ des Missions Africaines (SMA) of the Roman Catholic Church each employed a mix of European nationals. Father Boghero, who led the SMA in an effort to re› introduce Roman Catholic Christianity to West Africa in the nineteenth century, was an Italian. The pioneer SMA Fathers in most parts of the area which became Nigeria were French, just as it was such British missionaries as Thomas Birch Freeman of the Methodists and Samuel Ajayi Crowther of the CMS who pioneered the work of Christian missions in what was to become French Dahomey (present-day People's Republic of Benin).$^{33}$ British, French, German and Portuguese traders set up businesses adjacent to one another and, as the case of Badagry clearly demonstrated, there were residential quarters for diverse European nationals in the major ports all along the coast of the Bight of Benin.\nTraders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'Military conquest, 1885-1902 > The map of Africa after partition and occupation', 'content': ""The new geopolitical map of Africa that evolved after about a generation of systematic boundary-making and military occupation was quite different from what it had been in 1879 (see Fig. 1.1). The European powers had partitioned the continent into some forty political units. The new boun¬ daries have been regarded by some scholars as unacceptable because they were deemed to be arbitrary, artificial, precipitate and haphazard and to have distorted the national pre-European political order. Others, such as Joseph Anene and Saadia Touval, have regarded them as making more sense than they did by 1879.63\nThere is some truth in both points of view. Some 30% of the total length of the borders were drawn as straight lines, and these and others often cut right across ethnic and linguistic boundaries. On the other hand, the remaining borders did follow national boundaries and cannot therefore be considered as arbitrary or as ill-considered as the criticisms would suggest. Moreover, African political units evolving as a result, for example, of the Oyo-Dahomey conflict, the Fulani djihâds, the Mfecane in Southern Africa, or the internal struggle for power in both Ethiopia and Uganda during the second half of the nineteenth century, testify to the fluidity of African boundaries, frontiers and enclaves prior to the partition. What is not often realized is the extent to which the partition solidified these fluid boundaries, or the extent of the efforts made by the boundary com› missioners to rectify anomalies, where politically possible, during the numerous boundary delimitations. On balance, then, although the map of Africa in 1914 (see Fig. 2.1), compared to what it was in 1879, may have looked very confusing, the delimitation had nevertheless been a remarkably efficient job, thanks to the new advances in cartography. And although the partition must be condemned as illegal and immoral, and it must be recognized that some of the boundaries were indeed artificial and arbitrary, it would be undesirable - indeed dangerous - to continue to advocate a return to the fluid, pre-European international boundaries except after a very close scrutiny - because of the 'mess' said to have been created by the partition."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'New economic trends', 'content': 'Another interesting economic change in the nineteenth century, also often ignored by scholars, was the completion of the commercial unification of Africa.

Was it not like joining the Alpine Club in order to be lauded if you don\'t break your neck where your neck ought to be broken? This makes me turn back to the watershed, as I promised. It is a broad belt of tree-covered upland, some 700 miles in length from west to east. The general altitude is between 4,000 and 5,000 feet above the sea, and mountains stand on it at various points which are between 6,000 and 7,000 feet above the ocean level. On this watershed springs arise which are well-nigh innumerable—that is, it would take half a man\'s lifetime to count them. These springs join each other and form brooks, which again converge and become rivers, or say streams, of 20, 40, or 80 yards, that never dry. All flow towards the centre of an immense valley, which I believe to be the Valley of the Nile. In this trough we have at first three large rivers. Then all unite into one enormous lacustrine river, the central line of drainage, which I name Webb\'s Lualaba. In this great valley there are five great lakes. One near the upper end is called Lake Beniba, or more properly Bangweolo, but is not a source of the Nile, for no large river begins in a lake. It is supplied by a river called Chambuze and several others, which may be considered sources; and out of it flows the large river Luapula, which enters Lake Moero, and comes out as the great lake river Lualaba, to form Lake Kamolondo. West of Kamolondo, but still in the great valley, lies Lake Lincoln, which I named as my little tribute of love to the great and good man America enjoyed for some time and lost. One of the three great rivers I mentioned—Bartle Frere\'s, or Lufira—falls into Kamolondo, and Lake Lincoln becomes a lacustrine river, and it too joins the central line of drainage, but lower down, and all three united form the fifth lake, from which the slaves sent to me instead of men forced me, to my great grief, to leave as the \'unknown lake.\' By my reckoning—the chronometer being all dead—it is five degrees of longitude west of Speke\'s position of Ujiji; this makes it probable that the great lacustrine river in this valley is the western branch, or Petherick\'s Nile—the Bahar Ghazal, and not the eastern branch, which Speke, Grant, and Baker believed to be the river of Egypt.

If this be so, he modestly wishes to attach to it the name of Lieut. Wexter, his chief at Stanley Falls, ""a most courageous and capable African pioneer."" He took many interesting notes on this route from the Falls to Tanganyika, as to ivory and slave caravans, the nature of the country and people, the so-called dwarfs spoken of by Mr. Stanley, and some of which Lieut. Gleerup has seen among captured slaves. The journey from Stanley Falls, *via* Nyangwe, Ujiji, and Tabora, took Lieut. Gleerup six months, and from the west to the east coast two years and a half, 18 months of which were spent at stations on the Congo.

The tributary strikes off above Rubago eastwards. It is often stated that communication could be opened at certain seasons between Lake Tchad and the Binué by means of a tributary of the Shari, which comes from the vicinity of the Tuburi swamp, from which it was surmised the tributary of the Binué above referred to took its rise. But the English expedition pushed up the tributary in a little steam launch so far that the vessel could not be turned round, so that they were not very far from the source of the stream. This was a good many miles from the Tuburi marsh, and the character of the country between was such that there was no possibility of communication. This important point in the hydrography of Africa may, therefore, be regarded as solved. The English expedition had some curious experiences with the natives on the river. For a stretch of twenty miles they steamed up the river through a country quite uninhabited, though it seemed well adapted for settlement. All at once, as they rounded a point, large numbers of natives were seen running down the slopes of the hills that boarded the river. When these came within hearing distance they brandished their spears and shouted to those on board to go away, for they did not want any Moslems there. Through an interpreter on board the natives were told that the party on board were not Moslems, but white men and friends, and gradually the natives took heart and came down to the banks of the river. Then it was ascertained that the twenty-mile stretch was a no man's land between the Moslems below and the natives on the upper river. The latter swarmed round the launch, disporting themselves in the water, and evidently highly delighted. After a time, however, as the natives were evidently getting excited, it was thought prudent to retire, and this was done peacefully. The country is described as magnificent, reminding one of Switzerland, and apparently capable of great development. Happily, it may fairly be regarded as within the British sphere.—Times.\n\n---\n\n**Another African Expedition.**—A Paris Correspondent telegraphs to a contemporary: Captain Trivier has announced his intention of exploring again the West Coasts of Africa, and says he hopes also to be able to make a tour in the South.

Until the Moslemised Arabs took it in hand there was no evidence that any enterprising peoples had crossed the Sahara, or, indeed, had ever gone beyond hail of the coast, except along the Nile Valley. It was only 460 years ago that Europe set herself to define the contour of the African coast. It was just about a century since Europe seriously set herself to the task of exploring the northern half of that continent and of discovering the course of the great River Niger. The Nile source was only reached some thirty-four years ago, and during the past thirty years more had been done to spread a knowledge of the continent than during the 3,800 years before.

MacDonald, her Majesty's Commissioner to West Africa, gave an account of an important journey up the Binué tributary of the Niger which he made during his last visit to the region. Major MacDonald described in some detail the country and the people on the banks of the Binué, their political and social condition, and the efforts which the Royal Niger Company are making to develop commerce and civilisation. Nearly the whole region, he observed, is under cultivation, and the Fellatah people are evidently of a superior type. The most important part of Major MacDonald's paper related to a journey in a small steam launch up the Kibbé, a remote tributary of the Binué which comes from the north. No European had ever before ascended this river, and therefore Major MacDonald's description of his visit is an important addition to knowledge. An opinion had prevailed that through the Kibbé the Binué in the rainy season joined waters with the southern affluents of Lake Chad. Major MacDonald's exploration has pretty clearly proved that this is impossible. The general impression conveyed by Major MacDonald's paper is that the country watered by the Binué is capable of great development, and has an important future before it. Sir George Taubman Goldie, in speaking after the paper, reminded the audience of the great difficulties with which the Company had to contend in developing the country. On the lower river the natives belonged to the lowest stage of civilisation. Further in the interior a higher and more hopeful type was met with. It was only among the dominant and fanatic Fellatahs that Mohammedanism had a firm hold. The great bulk of the people were either Pagans, or only Mohammedans in name, all having an insuperable objection to work. It would take two or three generations before much result was visible; we are now really working for our grandchildren and great grandchildren.""}, {'id': 6424, 'article_title': 'The Niger Territory', 'full_section_title': 'The Niger Territory', 'last_edit_date': '04-18-1894', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1894#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_05_1894', 'content': ""\n\nMr. Jackson first showed, from the map of 1893, as compared with 1813, the great additions made to our knowledge of the Niger region, and emphasised the fact that this noble river, 2,600 miles in length, with its great tributary the Tchadda or Binue, was regarded in Europe for ages as semi-fabulous, though well-known to the ancients.

This term is in contradistinction to the Upper Niger, from Timbuctoo to the sources, which runs for a distance of 1,000 miles at the back of the French colony of Senegal, and which has been visited by several French exploring parties, though as yet no European trade has been opened there. Nor, indeed, can such trade be carried on profitably until the completion of the railway connecting the waterways of the Senegal and the Upper Niger. Between the latter and the Niger-Binue lies the long stretch of the Middle Niger, from Timbuctoo to Boussa; nature thus interposing a barrier of 800 miles between the Upper Niger basin, which will probably fall to France, and the Niger-Binue basin, which is already occupied by Great Britain. The Niger-Binue was unknown to Europe fifty-five years ago. The wildest theories were held as to the ultimate destination of the Niger—some geographers holding that it was absorbed by an inland sea, others that it fell into the Nile, others that it joined the Congo. The English traveller, John Lander, in 1831 solved the problem by starting from Badagry, and travelling northwards till he reached the Niger, near Boussa, where are the lowest rapids, and where commences the Niger-Binue system. He followed the river down 600 miles to the sea. Immediately on his return home, in 1832, his great discovery was turned to account by some Liverpool merchants, who despatched two steamers to nearly the highest navigable point on the Niger, and to Dagbo on the Binue. Numerous private expeditions from this country followed in the years 1834 to 1864, the most notable event being the formation in 1852 of the African Steamship Company, which established a line to Lokoga at the confluence of the Niger and Binue, 300 miles from the sea. Meanwhile the British Government had made efforts to open up both branches, and to lay down charts. Under an impulse given by Prince Consort, Parliament voted over £50,000 for the expedition of Her Majesty’s ships Albert, Wilberforce, and Soudan, during which the Government obtained the cession of a large tract of country about the confluence at Lokoga, where the British flag flies to this day. Another important expedition was that of 1854-5, during which were laid down most careful charts of the Binue for some hundreds of miles. In 1857 Parliament voted a five years' subsidy, averaging £7,000 a year, to Mr. Macgregor Laird, to assist him in developing trade in these rivers, and it was expressly stated on that occasion that immediate results could not be expected, but that posterity would reap the benefit. In a letter dated the 29th April, 1864, Earl Russell stated that he was willing to recommend a further subsidy of £6,000 for the same object. The proposal fell through—indeed, was rendered unnecessary by the springing up of British trade, which has lasted to the present day."", 'last_edit_date': '1884-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1884#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE EXPLORATION OF THE NIGER.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Among those who have lately done so much to make the geography of Africa familiar to Europeans, Mr. Joseph Thomson may fairly claim a prominent position. He has just returned from the Niger, where he went eight months ago on behalf of the African Trading Company. How rapid has been his progress on this important river is evidenced by the fact that in seven months he has performed the journey from London to Sokoto and back; three of these months were passed on the ocean. During that time Mr. Thomson succeeded in accomplishing the important mission with which he was intrusted. With the Sultans of Gando and Sokoto he has made treaties which give the company command of the Niger up almost to Timbuctoo, and of the Binue, its great tributary, to the limits of navigation. The company are at liberty to trade over all the dominions of these potentates, and treaties have been drawn out with such exactitude that neither the Sultans nor any European rivals can misunderstand them. Indeed, it is stated that Herr Flegel, who followed Mr. Thomson on the Binue on behalf of a German company, has been summarily turned out of the river. Mr. Thomson speaks in the highest terms of the value of the Niger as a trade route. The whole country is densely peopled with Mahomedan tribes, who have a passion for voluminous wrappings. The country is fertile, and, with ordinary care, not unhealthy. It is pretty certain the British Government will formally recognize these recent acquisitions of the company by extending to them its protection. Mr. Thomson was cordially received by the Sultan of Sokoto, who seemed delighted at the prospect of having direct trade dealings with England.\n\nIn Mr. Thomson\'s work on the Central African Lakes, he takes a desponding view of the resources of Africa. These resources, except in a few places, he believes not worth developing. One of these places is the Niger region, that river, according to him, being the only one of any commercial value. In this pessimistic view he is supported by Dr. Fisher, who preceded him in the Kilimanjaro region, and who had before that resided for seven years in Zanzibar. Dr. Fisher has just published a little volume (""More Light on the Dark Continent""), to show that from a commercial point of view Africa is worthless!

With the exception, however, of Abyssinia and the snowy mountain Kilimandjaro, explored by Von der Decken and the late Richard Thornton, few of these tracts have been laid down on detailed maps. In the central equatorial region, but for the example set by the three gallant officers of our Indian armies, Burton, Speke, and Grant, and encouraged and supported, I rejoice to say, by the Royal Geographical Society, those countries would have remained as unknown as they have been throughout all history, from the days of Ptolemy to our own. But if thus the chief water-basin of the White Nile has been boldly outlined, how much does there remain to be done in order to test the value of the anticipations of Dr. Beke—still more to complete a general sketch even of the geography of equatorial Africa!

Commercial geography says, How are we to open this up, and get into the interior of this great water system? Commercial geography has worked this out, while the International Association has been looking for routes and other means by which the trade should be carried. There is no doubt a cure has been found for that from the southern side of the Congo, and a railway is very shortly to be commenced. Wherever a railway or any means of communication can be carried into the interior of Africa, or the dark parts of Asia, there not only will trade improve, but we shall find that the people will improve in civilization; and as civilization improves, we should educate the people up to require improvement. I want these people not to be satisfied with sitting in a miserable hut, and sleeping alongside a fire, which they roll into; but I should like to see them sleeping under Manchester blankets, and keeping themselves warm, without risk of being burnt. On that line the Association will form their railway, and this great water system of the Congo will be brought into play; and every one is now looking forward to the construction of this road. The great idea of commercial geography, of course, is to find out places for trade. Everybody is selling as cheaply as possible, and therefore we have to find some place where we shall have a market for our goods. It would be almost better if people only worked six hours and got the same wages which they get now for working ten; and it would be better for the capitalist, on selling £100,000 worth of goods, to get the same profit he now gets on selling £200,000 worth of goods.\n\nThe French Government have, in the Gaboon district, nearly ruined trade by their prohibitive duties; and the differential duties in Portuguese colonies have done much harm. One of the reasons why the treaty with Portugal fell through was that, instead of a duty of 4 per cent., they wanted to impose a duty of 10 per cent. Now, owing to the Berlin Conference, neither 4 nor 10 per cent. is to be imposed to the north of the river.\n\nThe Niger has become to a great extent an English river. England, practically, is carrying out, on her own part, all the duties and all the laws communicated by the Conference, without the interference of any International Commission such as is established on the Congo.

The expedition is to be carried into execution by Herr Gottlob Adolf Krause, and the immediate object is described as the investigation of the languages and social state of the inhabitants of the region about the Niger, Benue, and Tsad Lake. Herr Krause intends to follow the Niger from its mouth upwards for a distance of about 300 miles, and then probably to take up his position in some suitable spot, whence he can make a general survey of the surrounding country, decide on his further course of action and await a favourable opportunity for an advance into the interior. The field for exploration will include the east and central territory of the Fulen (Felata Fulbe) and that of the Haussa Musik people. Herr Krause has spent much time in the most unfrequented regions of North Africa, and is therefore well acquainted with the difficulties of such an expedition. He also possesses the rare advantage of an extensive knowledge of African languages, having studied no less than nineteen of the various languages and dialects spoken between Shan and the Upper Senegal. He can also speak the Ful (Fulfulde), Kanuri, and the Haussa languages. It is hoped that the expedition may be rich in results, and especially in information as to the languages and general social condition of this region, which has been regarded as one of the points which offers most difficulty to those who have attempted to introduce civilization into Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1883#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the Meeting of the British Association', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the recent meeting of the members of the British Association, in the Geographical Section, Major Darwin, the Chairman, had a good deal to say about the development of Central Africa by means of railways. The great barrier, Major Darwin said, to the progress of colonisation was the belt of fever-stricken forest near the coast; and the problem was how to cross those malarial regions quickly into the healthy interior, where the higher type of Native was to be found. The slave-raiding in the interior also tended to impede progress; and the opening up of main trunk lines of communication would be the most effective means of counteracting the slave trade. To develop the traffic along the rivers and in the lakes was the first stage in the commercial evolution of a continent like Africa. But the rivers were obstructed by cataracts, and the construction of railways must, therefore, be the second stage. Taking the East Coast first, the first region to attract attention was the valley of the Nile and parts of the Central Soudan. The sooner this region was connected with the civilised world the better, and it was only as to the method of opening it up and as to who was to undertake the work that any question would arise. Below Berber the Nile was interrupted by cataracts for several hundred miles, while above that town it was navigable for 1,400 miles. The importance of a railway from Suakim to Berber was thus evident, and there was perhaps only one other place in Africa where an equal expenditure would open up such a large extent of country to European trade. Passing further south, the lines of communication next considered were those leading to the Victoria Nyanza, and on to the regions lying north and west of the lake. Two routes for railways had been proposed, one running through the British and the other through the German sphere of influence. The German route would be shorter, but the British line would open up more country to the east suitable for prolonged residence by white men. If the Germans wished to launch out on great railway projects in Africa, let them make a line from the south end of Lake Tanganyika to the northern end of Lake Nyassa, and thence on to the coast. Such a line of communication would be most valuable in putting an end to the slave trade, for it would erect a great barrier across the roads traversed by the raiders. Further south they came to the Zambesi River. This line had many faults. The whole valley was unhealthy, and white men would prefer a route which would bring them to high land more quickly. The Upper Zambesi valley was likely to be more attractive to white men. The Beira Railway would form a much better line of communication to this region than the river itself. The Congo afforded a grand opportunity of opening up the interior. From the coast there was 150 miles of navigable waterway, and afterwards there were 200 miles of cataracts, round which a railway was being made. From Stanley Pool there were 7,000 miles of navigable waterway, so they might predict a grand future for this route to the interior. The next great navigable waterway met with was the Niger. There was no area of equal size so densely inhabited, or where trade offered greater inducement to open up a commercial route. Little had to be done in this respect, for the Niger was navigable for light draught steamers 550 miles from the sea. The only drawback was the unhealthy nature of the coast districts which had to be traversed. At Lagos, a survey of a railway running in the direction of Rabba had been made, the objective being the towns of Abeokuta and Ibadan; and surveys had also been made for a railway to connect either Kormantin or Apam with Insuian. It was possible that those who selected this route were too much influenced by a desire to reach Coomassie, which was a political rather than a commercial centre. It was to be hoped that the merits of a line from Accra to Odumase would be considered before it was too late. For connecting the Upper Niger with the coast, the best commercial route would be a line running in a north-easterly direction to the Upper Niger. Such a line would connect the longest stretch of navigable waterway in this region with the best harbour on the coast. But the fact that it crossed the Anglo-French boundary was a bar to this project at present. The proposal to connect Algeria with the Upper Niger would be simple madness. The idea was thus to unite the French spheres of influence, but he was sure the French would not waste their money on such schemes. Concluding, the President said his object had been to prove that, notwithstanding the strides geography had made in past years, there was yet an immense amount of work ready for anyone who would undertake it.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1896#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'NAVIGATION OF THE RIVER NIGER.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '* Vide our September Number.\n\naltogether""!!

Even now our knowledge of them is very imperfect, their thorough exploration being impeded by climatic and physiographic influences. In a country, of which the greater part of the surface consists of swamps overgrown with mangrove forests, and which is rendered impenetrable by the luxuriance of the vegetation, geological and geographical studies are rendered all but impossible, whilst the absence of mountains prevents the traveller from obtaining a clear idea of the general configuration. The surface of the country presents a series of flat swampy plains, copiously watered by rivers and streams, and intersected by chains of hills gradually increasing in elevation as we recede from the sea-coast towards the interior, the said chains of hills being, very roughly, parallel to the average trend of the coast. Having regard to the large annual rainfall (about 60 in.), to the exceeding softness of the rocks, and the great sinuosities of the river, as well as to the general surface contour, no geologist can doubt that we have here a well marked example of a low plateau, from which hills have been produced simply by subaerial denudation, the harder portions having resisted the influence of the aqueous action which has worn the softer parts into hollows and valleys. In many cases, the hills owe their existence to a quartz reef which they enclose, and which has formed the backbone of the hill; a confirmation of this theory may be found in the fact that the northern slope of the hills is usually far steeper than the southern, the enclosed reef dipping to the south. The country rock is in most cases a non-stratified and but slightly indurated clay rock, resting upon soft blue slates, at times schistose; but in the present imperfect state of our geological knowledge of this region this statement must be regarded as conjectural rather than conclusive. The writer has never himself seen a single fossil that might aid in fixing the geological epoch of this formation, nor has he ever heard of such having been found, and is disposed to regard it as modern, geologically speaking. Round the bases of these low hillocks, and covering some of the more elevated plains, are deposits of non-consolidated gravels which are occasionally auriferous. These have been and are worked by the natives, especially on the banks of the smaller streams, tributaries of the river Ancobra, which intersects and forms the main highway of communication between the various gold mining concessions and the coast. Hitherto, none of these auriferous deposits have been found sufficiently rich to repay the attention which various European explorers have directed towards them, though there is no reason why such should not be discovered, especially towards the interior.

As E. A. Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts. The extent to which popular discontent surfaced more frequently during the second half of the century suggests growing class antagonisms as did slave uprisings in Lozi society and on the prazos.""\nIn other instances trading interests, independent of the rulers, were able to dominate commerce and undercut the position of the political authorities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Never in the history of Africa did so many changes occur and with such speed as they did between 1880 and 1935.

As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa.

Formerly we believed that there were only huge deserts and barren land, while now, on the contrary, it has been proved that large tribes of human beings exist there, who are more or less in a state of semi-civilization. Important towns with many inhabitants are built upon the shores of the lakes and the banks of the rivers. The Sahara itself is not at all what has been described in unfinished and superficial observations. The movable sands, too, which were considered an impassable barrier, extending far and wide, are in reality only local; and generally the soil has a consistency and firmness which does not differ much from the soil of Europe. Soudan appears to be the most important part of this huge continent. Some travellers reckon the population at over one hundred millions. There is a large river, the Niger, which spreads over half its extent. The inhabitants are industrious, and the elements of an international commerce seem to be in existence there to a very high degree. Again, in surmounting difficulties, more or less considerable, this country can be approached from two sides, by Algeria and by Senegal. This problem has for the last twenty years filled the minds of many, and the time seems come to solve it practically. Two years since M. Dapouchel, one of our principal civil engineers, obtained permission from the Government to go to Algeria to collect all possible information about the nature of Soudan, as well as of Sahara. He was assisted by the wonderful narratives which had been published by several travellers, especially those of M. Daveyrier, by the accounts of chiefs of caravans, and by information he received from distinguished officers, who had frequently made expeditions in the South of Algeria; also by undertaking himself an exploration on the borders of the Great Desert. M. Dapouchel has been able to publish a very interesting memoir, which shows the possibility of uniting ourselves to the Niger by an unbroken line of railroad of 1,250 miles.

He had not to speak of unthought-of prospects for their trade and fresh fields for philanthropic work. He proposed to carry them into the classic lands of African exploration, redolent of memories in connexion with Park, Clapperton, Denham, Lander, Barth, and a host of others. His object was to remind them of the heritage bequeathed to the British through the enterprise of those great travellers, and won at the cost of manifold hardships. He undertook the task more readily as there seemed to be an incredible amount of ignorance with regard to the Central Soudan. Few are aware of the existence of semi-civilized negro empires in the very heart of Africa, and the names of Sokoto, Kano, Kukawa, Yakoba, Illorin, and Bida are known but to the student. The geographical knowledge of the many is restricted to a hazy idea of the existence of a town named Timbuctoo, near which the Niger flows on its way to the Atlantic. It must not, however, be imagined, though the world was thus ignorant of this important region, that it had been utterly ignored and left untouched. Far from it. For years past the National African Company has been at work establishing itself on the river. From point to point it has worked its way, till its factories extend far into the very heart of the continent. Till lately the Company had been content to feel its way, laying a solid commercial basis in each district before entering into the heart of Central Africa. With the rise of the African craze and the scramble for Africa, it became of importance that the position of the Company should be secured, lest the labours of half a century should be ruined by some startling development of foreign commercial enterprise. Communication must be opened up with the two great Sultans—viz., Maliké of Gandu and Umuru of Sokoto—into whose territories the Company had found its way. To undertake this work he had been selected, and he embraced the opportunity of seeing something of Western Africa and the Niger basin. Thus it was that he transferred himself from his field of research in Eastern Africa to the other side of the continent. Speaking of the gin trade on the coast, he said that it was a scandal and a shame. Having reached the town of Rabba, the furthest factory of the National African Company, preparations were made for the land journey. The caravan consisted of three Europeans—Mr. Thomson, Mr. Hamilton, his companion from England, and Mr. W. J. Seags, who took charge of the financial matters of the expedition. Then followed two educated Coast natives. The rest of the caravan consisted of natives—Brassmen, Kruboys, and Fantees, from Akra and Elmina. On the 9th of April the caravan set out, taking the road which leads to Koutokora, in the hope that they might proceed direct to Sokoto instead of having to take the circuitous river route. On reaching Jega, we were on the great trade route which connects Timbuctoo and the Western Soudan with Bornu, and the kingdoms of the Chad region. Hitherto we had passed through sparsely populated districts, or countries desolated by war. Now, however, we had reached a healthy densely populated part, which throbbed with commercial activity. The enormous trade carried on along this trunk line was to me a never-failing source of wonderment, so unlike was it to anything I had elsewhere seen or imagined.

MacDonald, her Majesty's Commissioner to West Africa, gave an account of an important journey up the Binué tributary of the Niger which he made during his last visit to the region. Major MacDonald described in some detail the country and the people on the banks of the Binué, their political and social condition, and the efforts which the Royal Niger Company are making to develop commerce and civilisation. Nearly the whole region, he observed, is under cultivation, and the Fellatah people are evidently of a superior type. The most important part of Major MacDonald's paper related to a journey in a small steam launch up the Kibbé, a remote tributary of the Binué which comes from the north. No European had ever before ascended this river, and therefore Major MacDonald's description of his visit is an important addition to knowledge. An opinion had prevailed that through the Kibbé the Binué in the rainy season joined waters with the southern affluents of Lake Chad. Major MacDonald's exploration has pretty clearly proved that this is impossible. The general impression conveyed by Major MacDonald's paper is that the country watered by the Binué is capable of great development, and has an important future before it. Sir George Taubman Goldie, in speaking after the paper, reminded the audience of the great difficulties with which the Company had to contend in developing the country. On the lower river the natives belonged to the lowest stage of civilisation. Further in the interior a higher and more hopeful type was met with. It was only among the dominant and fanatic Fellatahs that Mohammedanism had a firm hold. The great bulk of the people were either Pagans, or only Mohammedans in name, all having an insuperable objection to work.

Just a little before the discovery of America thousands of the natives of the Congo were baptised by Catholic missionaries, and the Portuguese devoted themselves to the work of African evangelisation and exploration. They knew then as much of interior Africa as is known now after the great exploits of Livingstone and Stanley. There is a map in the Vatican, 300 years old, which gives the general physical relief and the river and lake systems of Africa with more or less accuracy; but the Arab geographers of a century before had described the mountain system, the great lakes, and the course of the Nile. Just about the time that Portugal was establishing a great empire on that continent, America was discovered, and it became the seat of Portuguese Power. Neither Egyptian, Carthaginian, Persian, or Roman influence was allowed to establish itself on that continent. It would seem that no solution of the African problem was to come from alien sources. Africans were not to share the fate of other dark races who have come in contact with the European. Europe was diverted to the Western Hemisphere. The energies of that conquering race were spent in building up a home for themselves on this side. Africa followed in chains.\n\nThe Negro race was to be preserved for a special work in the future. It is probable that if foreign races had been allowed to enter their country they would have been destroyed. So they were brought over to be helpers in America and at the same time to be preserved. Slavery would seem to be a strange school in which to preserve a people; but God has a way of salting as well as purifying by fire. The Europeans found in America an aboriginal race unable to co-operate with them in the labours required for the construction of the new civilisation. The Indians would not work, and have suffered the consequences of that indisposition: they have passed away.

According to Logan, the pre-Aryan civilisation of Southern India had a partially Egyptian character. The oldest races, he asserts, were of a variable African type which spoke languages allied to the African. Egypt, and not India, is the common cradle of all we have in common, east, west, north, and south, all round the world. The languages, beliefs, rites, laws and customs went out to India, but did not return thence by means of the apocryphal Aryan migrations. The Indian affinity with our European folk-lore and fairyology is neither first nor final, \'tis but the affinity of a collateral relationship. Egypt supplied the parent source, the inventive mind, the propagating migratory power.

In the far off past a Central African race got on to the Nile in its upper course, and gradually descended towards the Delta, halting in Æthiopia, but finding it impossible to stop on account of the pressure of population behind. Thus the Central Africans became Æthiopians, and the Æthiopians became Egyptians ... all the ends of the earth became peopled from Africa!!!""

Scott Keltie, F.R.G.S., gave the first of a series of three lectures on the ""Geography of Africa, with special reference to the exploration, commercial development, and political partition of that continent."" The lecture was illustrated by maps.\n\nMr. Scott Keltie began by remarking that during the past six years we had seen the bulk of a great continent parcelled out among a few great Powers. That continent was no new discovery. It was not a new world like America or Australia. It entered into the oldest traditions and the most ancient history. Long, indeed, before Greece entered the field, while yet Europe was the home of wandering barbarians, long even before Abraham left his father\'s fields, before the Phœnicians had settled themselves on the Syrian coast, one of the most wonderful civilisations on record had begun to work out its destiny on the banks of that Nile, the mystery of whose source, so long sought for, had been solved only within present memory. It was not the present business to discuss the origin or trace the history of Egypt. It was enough that the continent on which the oldest, or at least one of the oldest, civilisations was born and was developed through thousands of years, was even now less known than a continent discovered only 400 years ago, and had only during the last few years been taken seriously in hand by the peoples who had the making of the world\'s commerce and the world\'s history. It was only just 400 years since Columbus stumbled upon the New World, and yet what was in brief the history of America? It was now the home of 130,000,000 of people of European origin. It was, indeed, another Europe. The first British colonial settlement was planted in Australia little more than a century since, and it was only fifty years since that the continents there had had a free hand. Now they had 4,000,000 of people of European origin, mainly of British descent, whose trade was of the value of £120,000,000 sterling a year.\n\nThis was to be contrasted with what had taken place in Africa. The lecturer then proceeded to trace the progress of the knowledge of the African continent among those whose interests and enterprise had extended beyond their own homes.

The Phoenicians treated the part of Africa which they colonised as the British would, as the foundation of trade and commerce. The Phoenicians were followed, about 650 B.C., by the Greeks, who founded their first African colony Cyrene, on the coast of Tripoli. Then came the Carthaginians. They and the Greeks carried on a busy commerce all along the Mediterranean coast, far down to the Atlantic coast, to the mouth of the Red Sea. These were followed by the Romans, who continued an active career on the African coast until the decay of the Roman Empire.\n\nMr. Scott Keltie showed how little was known of the interior of Africa up to 150 A.D. by Ptolemy\'s map being thrown on to the sheet in the darkened theatre. This map, which was filled up haphazard fashion, gathered up, the lecturer said, all the knowledge of the continent which had accumulated during this long period of commercial activity — a knowledge which amounted to very little beyond the coasts and the Nile Valley. The next important period dealt with was the period of Arab invasion and the spread of the tenets of Mohammedanism — namely, from the seventh to the fifteenth century. In the early part of the fifteenth century commenced the ""glorious"" period of Portuguese activity, which lasted for some sixty years, during which the contour of the coast of Africa was completely laid down. This began the real modern partition of Africa, and the lecturer dwelt upon the effect which could be traced to Portuguese occupation of African territory — that occupation being marked by ruin rather than by enterprise. He rapidly traced the occupation of points of territory by Portuguese, Spanish, French, English, Dutch, Danish, and Germans, whose commerce was in ivory and slaves. He held that the opening up of the continent of Africa might be said to have begun with Bruce\'s travels in Abyssinia in the latter part of the eighteenth century. From that time until 1850 nearly the whole map of Africa became gradually filled up, and from 1850 down to the present day the southern half of the continent had received increasing attention at the hands of explorers until it also had had its main features laid down.

The great barrier, Major Darwin said, to the progress of colonisation was the belt of fever-stricken forest near the coast; and the problem was how to cross those malarial regions quickly into the healthy interior, where the higher type of Native was to be found. The slave-raiding in the interior also tended to impede progress; and the opening up of main trunk lines of communication would be the most effective means of counteracting the slave trade. To develop the traffic along the rivers and in the lakes was the first stage in the commercial evolution of a continent like Africa. But the rivers were obstructed by cataracts, and the construction of railways must, therefore, be the second stage. Taking the East Coast first, the first region to attract attention was the valley of the Nile and parts of the Central Soudan. The sooner this region was connected with the civilised world the better, and it was only as to the method of opening it up and as to who was to undertake the work that any question would arise. Below Berber the Nile was interrupted by cataracts for several hundred miles, while above that town it was navigable for 1,400 miles. The importance of a railway from Suakim to Berber was thus evident, and there was perhaps only one other place in Africa where an equal expenditure would open up such a large extent of country to European trade. Passing further south, the lines of communication next considered were those leading to the Victoria Nyanza, and on to the regions lying north and west of the lake. Two routes for railways had been proposed, one running through the British and the other through the German sphere of influence. The German route would be shorter, but the British line would open up more country to the east suitable for prolonged residence by white men. If the Germans wished to launch out on great railway projects in Africa, let them make a line from the south end of Lake Tanganyika to the northern end of Lake Nyassa, and thence on to the coast. Such a line of communication would be most valuable in putting an end to the slave trade, for it would erect a great barrier across the roads traversed by the raiders. Further south they came to the Zambesi River. This line had many faults. The whole valley was unhealthy, and white men would prefer a route which would bring them to high land more quickly. The Upper Zambesi valley was likely to be more attractive to white men. The Beira Railway would form a much better line of communication to this region than the river itself. The Congo afforded a grand opportunity of opening up the interior. From the coast there was 150 miles of navigable waterway, and afterwards there were 200 miles of cataracts, round which a railway was being made. From Stanley Pool there were 7,000 miles of navigable waterway, so they might predict a grand future for this route to the interior. The next great navigable waterway met with was the Niger. There was no area of equal size so densely inhabited, or where trade offered greater inducement to open up a commercial route. Little had to be done in this respect, for the Niger was navigable for light draught steamers 550 miles from the sea. The only drawback was the unhealthy nature of the coast districts which had to be traversed. At Lagos, a survey of a railway running in the direction of Rabba had been made, the objective being the towns of Abeokuta and Ibadan; and surveys had also been made for a railway to connect either Kormantin or Apam with Insuian. It was possible that those who selected this route were too much influenced by a desire to reach Coomassie, which was a political rather than a commercial centre. It was to be hoped that the merits of a line from Accra to Odumase would be considered before it was too late. For connecting the Upper Niger with the coast, the best commercial route would be a line running in a north-easterly direction to the Upper Niger. Such a line would connect the longest stretch of navigable waterway in this region with the best harbour on the coast. But the fact that it crossed the Anglo-French boundary was a bar to this project at present. The proposal to connect Algeria with the Upper Niger would be simple madness. The idea was thus to unite the French spheres of influence, but he was sure the French would not waste their money on such schemes. Concluding, the President said his object had been to prove that, notwithstanding the strides geography had made in past years, there was yet an immense amount of work ready for anyone who would undertake it.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1896#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE PARTITION OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In concluding, he said that he had laid before them what had been done during the past 3,000 years by the various great Powers who had had dealings with Africa for its geography, commerce, and civilisation. Around its coasts had successively swarmed Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Vandals, Arabs, Portuguese, and various European nations. Until the Moslemised Arabs took it in hand there was no evidence that any enterprising peoples had crossed the Sahara, or, indeed, had ever gone beyond hail of the coast, except along the Nile Valley. It was only 460 years ago that Europe set herself to define the contour of the African coast. It was just about a century since Europe seriously set herself to the task of exploring the northern half of that continent and of discovering the course of the great River Niger. The Nile source was only reached some thirty-four years ago, and during the past thirty years more had been done to spread a knowledge of the continent than during the 3,800 years before. At last the great blanks had been filled up in all the main features. Only seven years ago the wholesale partition of the continent among the Powers of Europe had begun, and it would be instructive to inquire into the causes which had been at work to effect this action.\n\nAt the close Mr. Scott Keltie exhibited modern maps in contrast to the ancient ones, showing how rapidly of late years the knowledge of the Dark Continent had spread.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-04-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_05_1891#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Development of Tropical Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Some portions being densely and some only sparsely populated, and there were portions of the Congo basin more densely populated than India. Where the population was only sparse, that might be accounted for by the tribal warfare which prevailed, and which could be suppressed by the introduction of civilisation. What was wanted was that peace should be maintained, and trade encouraged, to raise the natives to a civilised condition. The native population was divisible into three great classes—the Arab, the Negroid, and the Negro. The Arab race they met from the Nile to the Zambesi, and in the Sahara, as well as about the Great Lakes. They were the merchants and the traders, while the Negroids were the occupiers and cultivators of the soil. It was singular that, while the Arab race had endeavoured to oust the British from the Soudan, they had assisted them at Zanzibar. It was difficult to deal with them, and it would not do to drive them out as the Moors had been driven from Spain. The best thing to do would be to make them useful in Central Africa, to deal with them as we found them, and to place in their way such commercial prospects that they might be induced to abandon the slave trade. If they once got the Arab to join them, they could easily put a stop to the butcheries of the negro races by each other. As to the Negroids, they were being gradually absorbed by the other two races. The most important race to the British Empire was the Negro, who was capable of being rapidly civilised. He could not raise himself unaided, and he still remained as he had been limned 4,000 years ago upon the Egyptian frescoes. Yet as soon as he was brought into contact with civilisation he took it up rapidly, and soon became a good clerk, an engineer, a cook, or domestic servant. The Negro was far less alien to our civilisation than the Chinaman, and in the course of about 300 years there would be very little difference between him and the European except the colour of the skin. They might be weaned from slave-dealing, man-hunting, the burning of witches, and the offering of human sacrifices, and he did not know of any African prince who could be accused of anything like the beheadings and the quarterings that took place in the reigns of Henry VIII., Mary, and Elizabeth, nor did he find that any native African priesthood had been guilty of one-tenth of the horrible cruelty which had been perpetrated in Europe under the name of religion. In conclusion, he observed that if these portions of Africa with which he has been dealing could but be brought under the influence indicated, it would bring them an increase of knowledge, of wealth, and of power such as had accrued to them from their dominions in Asia.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-11-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/07_11_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True
